My experiences of soil sampling was great. I experience being able to test soil and see how some of the soils were different from each other. The biggest thing we was looking for was mercury. As we know mercury can can have a negative affect on plants and people and we wanted to make sure that our plants didn't have that. So we tested the soil. We made sure to also not let the soil touch each other also to wash our tools so we wouldn't mix one soil with another.
