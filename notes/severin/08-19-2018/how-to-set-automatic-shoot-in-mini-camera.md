I have purchased the Ballon mapping kit (already have a kite) and would like to set the automatic shooting (eg very 2 seconds) of the Prograce WP200 mini-camera, but I cannot find how to do it. There is a 2s timer that can be set, but it requires to press the shutter key (either on the camera or its remote control), what obviously cannot serve when the kit is 100+ meters high.
