Hey everyone, I'd like to announce a new project we're working on in the Kramer Lab at MSU.  We're creating a platform (tools + software + environment) with the goal of creating a global, open access database of plant health and photosynthesis information taken in the field.  Details are in the link below.  We're really looking forward to collaborating with others in the Public Lab community as we develop a first testable unit!
