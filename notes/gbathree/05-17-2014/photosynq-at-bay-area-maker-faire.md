Hey Publiclab folks, just wanted to let people know that PhotosynQ, the plant health measurement project, is at the Bay Area Maker Faire and we're running an experiment at the Faire.  We're letting participants take a MultispeQ device and measure plants on the event center grounds to measure photosynthetic efficiency, and get some real world testing of the MultispeQ.  

**You can find more posts this weekend on google plus under #photosynq.**

Also posted some pictures here:

After the Faire, I'll put together a more organized post with updates on the equipment and data from the event's research project, but just wanted to let folks know where we are.
