So we took 6 MultispeQs to North Dakota and measured 150 varities of the common bean.  We're interested in the common bean in part because it is widely used in developing countries.

Here's a link to the full article.](http://photosynq.org/hello-fargo-ive-come-beans/)

I know it's not particularly related to environmental testing, but we did manage to test the PhotosynQ online analysis tool and get some good initial results, there's some good screenshots at the end there.

In other news, Geoff is working on some environemental methods which we hope to have some more details on in upcoming posts.  One is soil carbon based on this paper: https://www.enst.umd.edu/sites/default/files/_docs/Weil_et_al_2003_corrected.pdf, should be fairly straightforward and we already have the appropriate wavelength on the MultispeQ.  

Some other partners at Cornell in Rebeca Nelson's lab have also done some interesting work on soil biological activity and seed mold detection using the CO2 sensor.  Hope to have some updates on that as well in the future.
