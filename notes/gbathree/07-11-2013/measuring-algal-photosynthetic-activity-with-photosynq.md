So we've been makinng good progress on Photosynq, our little handheld photosynthesis measurement device, and for the last 2 weeks we've been taking it out for a spin - with algae!

We set up the device so that the optics are pressed agains the sidewall of an algae bioreactor with a linear actuator which pulls the head up and down.  That way, the Teensy 3.0 brain can move the actuator, take a measurement, move the actuator, take a measurement, etc so we can get measurements of photosynthetic activity up and down the algal column.

It actually works very very well, and we hope to have some data pretty soon.

The rest of the post is here: http://photosynq.org/measuring-algae-with-the-photosynq/

Next steps is going send out the new pcb design and get it working, get the bluetooth working (which has been surprisingly difficult) so we are truly wireless.
