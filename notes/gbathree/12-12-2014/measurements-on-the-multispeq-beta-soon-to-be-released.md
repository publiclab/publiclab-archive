Hey guys, I've been posted every couple weeks about progress on PhotosynQ, the platform for anyone to create, share, and analyze plant health information, and wanted to give another update.  This one details the measurements which will be included in the MultispeQ when we ship it (which should be soon), and has a quick update on our production run and how it's going.

Expect more updates in the coming weeks as we crank production, probably posted somewhere between our[ g+ account (https://plus.google.com/+PhotosynqOrg)](https://plus.google.com/+PhotosynqOrg),[ the blog (www.photosynq.org),](www.photosynq.org) and here.

Our initial run will be sold through Public Lab's Kit's Initiative (woo hoo!), but the first 50 have been spoken for for about 6 months already.  We'll keep trying to crank them out, so those who are interested keep an eye out and we'll make another call for beta testers once production gets caught up with demand.
