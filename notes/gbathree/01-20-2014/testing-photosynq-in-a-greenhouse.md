Just made a new post with some new data taken from a nearby greenhouse using MultispeQ.  We successfully tested a few different measurements, specifically photosynthetic efficiency (Phi2), SPAD (chlorophyll content), photosystem I activity, light level, CO2 content, temperature, and relative humidity.  The data looks really good!

We also made a significant improvement in our detector to reduce noise.  I think this will allow for a great deal of other absorbance type measurements for trace contaminants in water or soil, so if anyone has specific methods for detecting contaminants using absorption or fluorescence I'd love to hear them and try them out.
