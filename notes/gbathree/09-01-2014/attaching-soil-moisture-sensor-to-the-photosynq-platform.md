So last week I tried attaching one of YwRobot's soil conductivity meters (good proxy for soil moisture) to the MultispeQ device and PhotosynQ's data display / sharing / analysis backend.

It worked great!  [See the full blog post for details.](http://photosynq.org/attaching-sensors-multispeq-part-1-ywrobot-soil-moisture-sensor/)

Next, I really want to try to connect another public lab's sensor and do some more detailed analysis using the online analysis tool, I'm going to try the riffle (or at least a riffle arduino sketch on a Arduino Uno board).  If you have other arduino compatible devices to try to connect let me know.
