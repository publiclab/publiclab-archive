I am writing a course on bioremediation in the soil and we are talking a lot about  charcoal for soil and water filters.  We are teaching how to make water filters in class and I am wondering what to do with the charcoal after it has been used to remove toxin. We are working in petroleum impacted community's in Ecuador so the toxins are pretty intense and varied.
