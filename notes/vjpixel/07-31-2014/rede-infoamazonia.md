###About

The project will use environmental sensors connected via mobile networks to generate indicators of water quality in 2 cities in the Brazilian Amazon, Santar√©m and Belterra. Starting in December, 2015, the project will inform people on the quality of water, reducing water contamination by disease and environmental degradation. The goal is to provide real-time data on contamination of water tanks. The data collected by this network of sensors will be distributed to the government, citizens and non-governmental organizations through the alert system for mobile phones (SMS) and web mapping applications.
