###What I want to do

Create a Portuguese language mailing list.

###Motivation

There are some people from Brazil (and I hope other Portuguese speaking countries) on the main Public Lab mailing list.  Having a mailing list in Portuguese will allow people that doesn't speak English to be part of the community.

###Questions and next steps

The main question is: there are enough people in Public Lab mailing list that speak portuguese and are interested in the creation of a Portuguese speakin mailing list?

Also: The creation of this list will improve communication and open space for people that don't speak English to join the Public Lab community?

Ives Rocha and I where discussing the best way to discover if the creation of the list makes sense. I think that we can test is asking if there are people on Public Lab mailing list that speaks Portuguese and have interest in the creation of a Portuguese language list. If there are at least 10 people, we think that it can be enough people the create a new list.

###Why I'm interested

I'm part of innovation lab (EcoLab) that have projects that uses sensors to monitor air and water quality. For me it's interesting to share what we are learning on the EcoLab and also learn with other people.
