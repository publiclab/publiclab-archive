Have several cameras for drone operation ....  Wanted to move away from my GoPros and look into using a larger image sensor type camera so I chose **Olympus CAMEDIA C-3040\.**

****What I would like to know if this is a camera that is recommended for NDVI or should****I****resort to another type of camera.  I figured with the white balance it would be easier to setup for my NDVI images than the GoPro.  

  
Any information would be appreciated ..****
