In [#balloon-mapping](https://publiclab.org/tag/balloon-mapping), [#timelapse](https://publiclab.org/tag/timelapse), #[photo-monitoring](https://publiclab.org/tag/photo-monitoring) and other methods documented on this site, you often end up with thousands of photos -- this activity shows how to upload and share them using [Archive.org](https://archive.org).

Lots of photos can be hard to upload to the web or share with others; we've collected a few different approaches to this at the [Photo Sharing page](https://publiclab.org/wiki/photo-sharing). Take a look and choose a technique that works for you.
&nbsp;
###Pros & Contras using Archive.org

**Pros**:

* Non profit organization focused on long term unaltered file archiving.

* Unlimited number of files.

* Unlimited size of each file.

* Several formats allowed: images (jpg, png...), video (mp4, ogv, mov...) audio (ogg, mp3, aiff...) pdf, text files...

* Direct and torrent download autogenerated links.

* Keeps unaltered original files and automatically generates low res copies.


**Contra**:

* Private publications not allowed. Everything uploaded to Archive.org goes public.

&nbsp;
###Step 1 - Get your archive.org account
Visit [Archive.org](https://archive.org) and create your "library card"

&nbsp;

Drag and drop the files you want to upload in the box.

Fill the required information with the red asterisco and be sure that "Test file" says "NO" or files will be deleted after one month:

&nbsp;
Be patient and wait untill your files finish uploading and till your page is created.

&nbsp;
###Step 3 - Sharing
Once your page has been created visit [https://archive.org/details/nameofyourpage](null).
&nbsp;

For the rest of this guide visit this example;

&nbsp;

As you can see there's a "DOWNLOAD OPTIONS" box at the right side of the page.
The full information package can be directly shared in two ways:

* Direct download clicking on "16 ORIGINAL"

* [Via torrent](https://publiclab.org/n/14183) file clicking on "TORRENT". In this case you'll need a torrent downloader like [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/)
&nbsp;

You can also view a complete list of the files contained in the package clicking on "SHOW ALL" and share them individually. Right click on the file and select "Copy link location".
