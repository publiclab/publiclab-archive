###What I want to do
I want to verify my mobius camera is taking the correct type photos

###My attempt and results
My results show a reddish hue to my photos, however, vegitation does appear pastel/blue

###Questions and next steps
Where is the home directy located to store the config file? Is it on the SD card?

###Why I'm interested
I want to use MATLAB image processing to advance NDVI into further detail, and identify areas of low photo synthesis on individual plants.
I want to tell which parts are doing well, and which are not to a very fine accuracy.
