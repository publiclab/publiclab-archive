## About me

I am Sara, a second year Computer Science student. I got to know about open source this year and this is my first time contributing.

**Affiliation:** **Ghulam Ishaq Khan institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology**

**Location:** Pakistan

## Project description

The Infragram project brings together a range of different efforts to make Do-It-Yourself plant health comparisons possible with infrared photography. Basically, users upload the image and can also use infragram webcam, infragram uses different techniques to help people analyze the image. The infragram UI design needs some improvements to make it more user friendly. Furthermore, it also lacks some features that can make the site look more organized.

### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

_Enhancing the UI design of Infragram, while keeping users good experience and needs in mind._

### Problem

**Front Page:**

![image description](/i/46084.jpg "p1.jpg")\*\*

\*
I changed the color combination, in terms of
focusing on visitors attention.

\*
I think logo text needs some adjustments so I
rearranged texts to give it a better look.

\*
I think picture upload page should be separate
from the editing page so I come up with this design. User can upload and drop
file or use infragram web camera.

\*
On dropping and uploading picture, the new
window will open.

\*
It will have a
login and sign up option on the home page.

\*
On the **Nav bar** there are three options.

**1\. Learn**

Its execution is explained in the picture above.

**2\. Report an issue**

It will take the user to Infrgram github repository

**3\. Infragram**  
\*\*![image description](/i/46085.png "Screenshot_(125).png")

Infragram will have all these options so user can directly
learn infragram from this page, so there will be no need to got to public lab page first

I designed this page as it will contain all the information about how to use infragram and about filters and math expression etc. On clicking the options it will display all the relevant details about that topic.![image description](/i/46086.jpg "plnew11.jpg")

\*\*4\. \*\***FAQs**

\*\*\*\* I
think Q& A section is very wide that it is difficult to scroll through the
website as Q&A section comes in between. The FAQs in the Nav bar can directly take the user to this section. I think there should be a search option as it will be a lot easier for the user to filter through questions. I would also like to add the filter between "answered and answered" question but I haven't add it in the design. There is an expand option on the right side of question, it will show the answer and the likes and replies will be written under the answer .

![image description](/i/46087.jpg "plnew8.jpg")

Ask question section will right below the Q/A section

![image description](/i/46088.jpg "plnew9.jpg")

**Editing window:**

This
window will open once user upload an image or open webcam.

![image description](/i/46089.jpg "p2.jpg")

**On clicking convert
icon:**

A small side window will expand and it will show
functionalities the icon provide

**1) Convert/ Analyze**

I think the convert tool should be more
specific on what the user should enter as input as it is a little confusing.
While using infragram I was inputting digits in the start so I think users can
also make the same mistake. For that I designed it this way, where user can get
a menu of expression to choose expression and can also write their own
expressions. Furthermore, we can add details of expressions little description but since I m not an expert in this so I left that portion empty. The image is
attached below. The preset option will also be in the convert menu as it is
also the part of conversion, but there will be no write your own expression
option in it.

**2) Colorize**

I find colorize option a little
intimidating as well, so I changed its style a little to make it more simple
and easy to user.

**3) Overlay**

The current overlay tool is not well
organized as the slide bar is very far so its confusing wether the slide bar is
associated with overlay or not. I tried to give it a little simple yet understandable
look.

### Needs

I will need help from mentors where I get stuck. Especially while understanding the current codebase I might face challenges as its written by someone else.

### First-time contribution

My first contribution: [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/10843#issue-1181954050](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/10843#issue-1181954050 "https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/10843#issue-1181954050")

### Experience

I started my computer science journey 2 years ago; I learnt C++ during my first year in university and made several projects in C++. During my second year and I learnt HTML, CSS, Javascript and reactJS. I took software development course this semester in my university and I will be done with this course by May 30\.

---------

### Teamwork

I have worked in team several times throughout my 2 years in university. Mostly my projects are group based, which includes both CS and non CS bases projects. I am a part of Microsoft Student Club; moreover, I was a part of ICPC management team and arranged codding competition in my university.

---------

### Passion

Firstly, I really appreciate the Public Lab mentors, the way they supported us through out was really welcoming. I also want to be a part of such organization so that I can welcome the new developers the same way. Also I see this opportunity as my way forward to opensource. I personally think though this opportunity I can learn a lot especially under constant guidance. I worked hard drafting my proposal and understanding Infragram; I want to gain experience by working with community.

### Audience

I am from a village background and I have interacted so much with farmers and I know how much they get worried about their crops health etc. I didnt know that there is a software exists that can do this task. I would like to introduce more people to infragram so that they dont have to pay for this.

### Commitment

I understand that this is a full-Time commitment. I have a semester break from 12 June to 1st October. I am fully available throughout the internship period.
