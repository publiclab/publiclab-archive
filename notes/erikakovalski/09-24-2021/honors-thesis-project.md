I am a senior in the Commonwealth Honors College at UMass Amherst. I am currently working on an honors thesis project that incorporates the use of a Raspberry Pi to construct an instrument that will be used to collect data and solve a research question. I will be posting updates and progress in this thread. As for my first update, I have been jumping between a few ideas regarding bacterial disinfection and human medicine but have decided to build upon a previous project that I worked on a few years ago during a science fair.
