I am running a series of spectrometer experiments and I have noticed variability in the peaks of my spectra from day to day.  I am using the same light source, positioning, and spectrometer positioning for each run, but each time I boot up my laptop and camera interface I have to set the "yellow line" threshold for the spectrometer camera.  Is there a way to fix the position from day to day so I have consistent measurements?
