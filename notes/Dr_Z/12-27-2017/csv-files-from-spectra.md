What are the units in the CSV files?  The wavelengths are provided in the far left, but the values for the blue, green, and red peaks are different from the %intensity that can be obtained from scrolling along the spectra graphs with the mouse.  The values are over 100, so it doesn't appear to be the % transmittance.  The values are also too high for absorbance.  Could someone please clarify for me?  Thank you.
