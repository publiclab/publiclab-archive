### Introduction:

My name is Jeremiah Jackson. I am currently a resident in St. John the Baptist Parish where we currently have a chemical plant based in our area called Denka, which was firstly called DuPont. This chemical plant has caused major pollution problems in our area.  

### Our main concern:

The exhaust from Denka/DuPont has caused high pollution levels across my parish. This has caused high cancer levels in our area that many lawsuits have tried to be filed against the plants to fix this problem. This problem has been affecting many generations and will affect many generations after mines if this problem isn't fixed.   

### Obstacles and supporting information:

There are many causes of the pollution levels: However, the main reason for this is the crazy amount of chloroprene that Denka lets out. These toxins have been affecting this parish for many years. 

Who is engaged in this concern?  

Our parish as a whole is engaged in this concern, because it affects all of us.   

### What are the initial questions?

What can we do to reduce the amount of toxins that are put into the air?
