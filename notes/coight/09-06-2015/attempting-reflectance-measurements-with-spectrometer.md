###What I want to do
 I am trying to undertake reflectance measurements from a version of the public lab spectrometer mounted on a robot

. 

###My attempt and results

Graphs show what I got from 416-770 nm version of the public lab spectrometer using RPi NOIR camera and DVD diffraction grating (X numbers don't match up.  Graphs on right show profession spectrometer results


###Questions and next steps

There is a lot of noise and artefacts in these spectra. I'm using a known light source and using a division between sample and light source (a white reflector) to obtain reflectance spectra. Any help would be appreciated in cleaning this up.
