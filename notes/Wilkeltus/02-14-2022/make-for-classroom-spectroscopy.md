Easy to make but very tight tolerances. Took me 1hr to hone down the parts before they fitted (blame my printer ;-) ). 

Because I want to be able to change the DVD-grid I used tape to fix the parts. 4 screws to fix the roof would be a nice-to-have for the next version pls.

  
Makes good pictures though. Big step forward compared to the paper spectrometer. 

  
Thanks for preparing it and regards, JÃ¶rg
