Hello Public Lab Community,

  
Our fellowship team is working to use law and policy in our fight against extractive industry in Minnesota. If you have any expertise in or experience with Native American and Tribal law and policy in Minnesota, please share! We are interested in exploring any and all avenues of advocacy.
