The principle of Free, Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) is an
obligation in international law. As [explained by](https://www.fao.org/indigenous-peoples/our-pillars/fpic/en/)
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, Free, Prior
Informed Consent respects and includes Indigenous people while also promoting
their issues. The "free" piece means that the Indigenous people who are likely
to be impacted by an action give their consent freely, that is without being
coerced, intimidated, or manipulated. "Prior" means that whoever is doing the
action, whether that be a government or a private entity, seek consent from the
Indigenous tribe before any authorization or commencement of the activities.
Indigenous people are properly "informed" when they are engaged in the process
and are given adequate information to base consent on. Finally, "consent"
encompasses a collective decision made by Indigenous communities, who hold
rights to land, knowledge, resources, their culture, and more. 

In international law, FPIC comes from the right to
self-determination. FPIC is generally applied through specific treaties and
declarations that countries, as Parties, sign onto. Through many instruments
and implementations, the [overall
consensus](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&context=njihr) is that nations must have good faith consultations with
Indigenous peoples before gaining access to their resources or acting in a way
that could harm Indigenous peoples.

In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the ["United
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples."](https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2018/11/UNDRIP_E_web.pdf) Several Articles
in the Declaration specifically reference FPIC. Article 10 requires that Indigenous
peoples cannot be relocated without FPIC and that they must receive "just and
fair compensation and, where possible, with the option of return." Article 11
requires countries to provide redress for cultural, intellectual, religious,
and spiritual property taken without Indigenous peoples' FPIC. Article 19 says
"States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples
through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free,
prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or
administrative measures that may affect them." Similar to Article 11, Article
28 requires redress when Indigenous peoples' land is taken from them without
FPIC. Article 29 ensures that countries cannot store or dispose of hazardous
materials on Indigenous land or territories without their FPIC. Finally,
Article 32 says that "States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with
indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in
order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to the approval of any
project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, particularly
in connection with the development, utilization or exploration of mineral,
water or other resources." Although the Declaration is non-binding, therefore
considered "soft law," it sets out ideals for nations to implement into
national law.

Nations have translated FPIC from an international
principle, which is generally non-binding and non-enforceable, into binding and
enforceable national laws. The Declaration encourages nations to "provide
effective mechanisms for prevention" and redress of actions that is meant to
harm Indigenous people. The harm could be to their culture, land, resources, or
rights. Disappointingly, the United States Government does not have any national
laws on FPIC. 

The State of Minnesota has translated FPIC into a state
requirement. On April 4, 2019, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz issued [Executive
Order (EO) 19-24](https://mn.gov/governor/assets/2019_04_04_EO_19-24_tcm1055-378654.pdf), titled "Affirming the Government to Government
Relationship between the State of Minnesota and Minnesota Tribal Nations:
Providing for Consultation, Coordination, and Cooperation." This EO recognizes
the important relationship between the State of Minnesota and the Minnesota
Tribal Nations. The EO requires the State of Minnesota to engage in
"\[m\]eaningful and timely consultation" with the Minnesota Tribal Nations to
"facilitate better understanding and informed decisions..." Therefore, all state
agencies in Minnesota must consult with Minnesota Tribal Nations prior to
allowing projects that could potentially impact the Minnesota Tribal Nations. 

Minnesota's EO is a first step towards honoring the
international law principle of FPIC. EOs should only be a temporary solution
because the next president or governor could repeal them unilaterally. Because
of this both, the U.S. Government and the Minnesota Legislature need to honor
FPIC through legislation that codifies FPIC into law.
