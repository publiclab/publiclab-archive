So yesterday we did an experiment on balloon mapping. In the experiment we used a 500ft string that was attached to a balloon which was filled with helium. I learned how to take a surface area picture of 500ft. I also learned how to create a Balloon mapping tool. I also learned how to attach a camera to the Balloon. This is what I learned yesterday.
