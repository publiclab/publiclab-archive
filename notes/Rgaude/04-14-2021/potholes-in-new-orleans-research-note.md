So far we have brainstormed about environmental issues in our area. Then we did some research on each issue and decided on a topic, potholes in New Orleans. We brainstormed different topics and questions we could answer on the topic, and we organized these thoughts in an infographic displayed below. In the near future we will try to go out into the field to answer these questions: how does soft soil affect potholes/how does water affect potholes, what effect do floods have on the road, and how can potholes be repaired with asphalt?
