When it came to the idea of what problem or topic we could discuss and research about, the one that immediately came to mind was potholes as they are everyday occurrences in the state of Louisiana. When I thought about it, I instantly looked up as much information as possible and came up with questions based around the topic to possibly ask people in a survey or to even look to answer them ourselves. From the data we collected out of 124 responses, we reached the consensus that many people are aware that potholes are everywhere in the environment and that they can be very dangerous if left unattended. Looking at the responses involving our soil, climate, and flooding in our environment in the survey, there is relatively soft soil in a hot and humid climate with multiple occurrences of flooding throughout the year.
