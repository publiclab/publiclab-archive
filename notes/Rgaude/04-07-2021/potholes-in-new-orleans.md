### Introduction:

I live in LaPlace, Louisiana (near New Orleans), and I was brainstorming ideas about local environmental problems when potholes came to mind. New Orleans has many large potholes, and they interfere with nearly every person driving through this major city.   

### Our main concern:

Potholes in New Orleans are large and frequent, and they can annoy drivers, cause damage to vehicles, and potentially cause car accidents.  

### Obstacles and supporting information:

There may be a variety of causes for potholes; I have heard that they can be caused by freeze/thaw cycles and/or sinking or loose soil. Despite efforts to repair potholes, they are still many of them, big and small, in the city of New Orleans.   

### Who is engaged in this concern?

New Orleans' Department of Public Works is currently working on repairing reported potholes.  

### What are the initial questions?

Delete this text and replace "tagname" below with the unique project tag you'd like to use to follow your issue.
\_Note: the tag is how the material posted after you share this post will be organized. Tags need to be one word, or a couple words separated by a hyphen for example "dredge" or "lake-dredge". Any questions with that tag will populate this grid. If you want to keep out broad questions related to the topic, choose a tag that could be unique to your issue for example: "Madison-Lake-Dredge"
