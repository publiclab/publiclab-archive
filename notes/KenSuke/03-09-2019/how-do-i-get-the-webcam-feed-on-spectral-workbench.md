Hi there,  
  
I'm trying to calibrate my desktop Spectrometer. I have constructed it properly, and have used Open Broadcasting software (OBS) to make sure the webcam and dvd fragment are aligned properly. I'm able to see the spectrum with this , so I know that the webcam works and is aligned properly.  
  
My difficulty is with the website. It detects the webcams connected to my system (integrated laptop webcam, and the spectrometer) but will not display any picture from either of them. The video-feed for selecting cross section just remains grey.  
  
Any advice ?  
  
Thanks
