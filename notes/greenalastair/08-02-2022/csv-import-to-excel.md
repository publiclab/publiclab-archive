Hi all. I'm unable to import the CSV data from my spectra into excel. The formatting of the CSV seems very strange. Usually in a CSV each row is on a new line but the download I'm getting is all one line and I can't get it to import correctly into excel. Can anyone help? I've attached an image of my setting below. Thanks.
