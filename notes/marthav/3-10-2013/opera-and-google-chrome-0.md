Once again I need help.  I had to set my spectrometer project aside for a couple of weeks and now that I'm back at it I'm finding that Google Chrome does not allow me to use the spectrometer's webcam it defaults to my mac's webcam even though photo booth has the spectrometer set as default.  I've downloaded Opera but I don't see how to take a spectrometer picture.  Please see Opera screenshot attached.
