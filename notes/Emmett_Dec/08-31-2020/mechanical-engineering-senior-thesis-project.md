Hello! I am excited to share that I will be completing my Senior thesis project using Raspberry Pi to create scientific instrumentation. As part of Open Science Instrumentation and Data Collection at UMass Amherst, I will be building a novel device which uses the instrument created. I look forward to sharing my work and seeking advice in this awesome community.
