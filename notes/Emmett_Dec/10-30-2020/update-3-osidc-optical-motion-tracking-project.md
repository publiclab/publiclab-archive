The general goal of this project is to set up an optical motion tracking system using raspberry pi cameras and motion tracking software. The biological question of this project is focused on testing the efficacy of applying the averaging theorem to the flapping dynamics of a certain species. Data will be gathered using inexpensive rapsberry pi v2 camera modules and a motion tracking software such as DLTdv will be used for image analysis. The primary consideration for the image-gathering portion of the instrument will be in the optimal positioning of the cameras to capture desired data simultaneously.
