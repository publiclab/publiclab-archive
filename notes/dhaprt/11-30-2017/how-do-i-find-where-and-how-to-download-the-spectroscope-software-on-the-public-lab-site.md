I tried to locate and find where and how to download the software for the spectroscope and have not been able to locate it on the web site. I would also like to know what platform to use. I have a Mac. I have all of the components for the spectroscope except for the camera.  Can I order the camera on Ebay, and if so, what is the description of it?

  
It may also be helpful to describe the type of camera needed. For example, would a raw RGB format be desirable? Are there some camera features like autofocus or Infrared capability that would not be desirable?
