###Details about the problem
When conducting my [youth balloon mapping workshop](http://publiclab.org/notes/mjain26/07-28-2014/youth-balloon-mapping-workshop-complete), I ran into the issue of the images being overexposed. So I played around with my camera, and along with the help of the Public Lab community, I reached a solution....
###My solution
There are four important settings other than the continuous shooting. 

**1. ISO**
To make the camera less sensitive to light, choose a lower ISO. Meaning, if it was very bight out, you want the ISO to be lower than if it was dark. On my camera, you can do that by 1) hitting the center button with "func. set" on it, 2) scrolling to the ISO setting, and 3) adjusting it from there. 

**2. White balance**
Before shooting, make sure the choose the correct white balance setting. On my camera, they are classified by your environment (e.x. day light, cloudy, fluorescent, etc.). To do this, 1) hitting the center button with "func. set" on it, 2)scroll to the white balance setting, and 3) adjust. 

**3. Infinity **
Make sure the camera is on the infinity setting, no matter the weather conditions or the environment. On my camera, it is the button to the left of the "func. set" button. You can choose between "macro", "normal", and "infinity". 

**4. Exposure **
Before shooting, point to lens towards the sky and adjust the exposure setting accordingly. On my camera, it is the button right about the "func. set" button. Click it and scroll from side to side. You will be able to notice on the screen the adjustment. Choose the clearest setting. 

Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
