# Youth Balloon Mapping Workshop

###What I want to do
My name is Meghan Jain. I am working with the Civic Lab in Chicago. I want to create a workshop for youth in Chicago on Balloon Mapping. 

###My attempt and results
I have researched what makes a good curriculum extensively. I found that constant feedback and participation is necessary, especially in the realm of science. The attached files are all pieces of the curriculum. The file titled "draft 1" is the outline. The outline includes information and/or tips on the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, oil dispersants, how to set up the system, stitch the map, take the images and much more. The file titled "finalstepsbeforeflight" is a drawing of one of the trickier parts of the set up. The file titles "balloon mapping template" is a worksheet for the participants of the workshop. 

###Questions and next steps
I am looking for feedback on my work thus far. I do want to say that this is a work in progress. Any and all feedback would be greatly anticipated. I am really bad at using markdown so please excuse the simple formatting.
