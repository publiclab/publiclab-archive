Hello, I would like to measure a few claimed UV-C LED products I'm purchasing with a DIY spectromter. I don't think the direct approach will work, photographing through the diffraction grating, since the camera's glass lenses and sensor covering will block UV-C wavelengths. Would it be possible to project the diffracted light onto a surface like paper which could fluoresce and give an indication of the wavelength of the light source? Or any other ideas?
