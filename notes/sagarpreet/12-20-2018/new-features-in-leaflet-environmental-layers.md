There are many new features and layers added to Leaflet-Environmental-Layers library and these new features will be soon LIVE on PublicLab and Mapknitter .

**List of new updates :**

### Sharing of Maps with preloaded layers using URL :

Suppose you want to share a map at latitude 44.770 and longitude -90.483 and at zoom level 7 with overlay layers of mapknitter and skytruth-alerts to be active , you can share URL (copy it from the browser's address bar itself ! ) :

[https://publiclab.github.io/leaflet-environmental-layers/example/index.html#7/44.770/-90.483/BL2-STruth-MapK](https://publiclab.github.io/leaflet-environmental-layers/example/index.html#7/44.770/-90.483/BL2-STruth-MapK)

Here BL2 = BaseLayer2

STruth = SkyTruth Layer

MapK = MapKnitter Layer

### Introduction of Spinner while layer is being loaded :

Earlier we had no idea whether the layer is getting loaded or has already being loaded . To solve this ambiguity we have introduced a layer which will come automatically when new data is being getting fetched .

### PurpleAir-Layer works smoothly now :

In the initial versions of LEL library , adding purple air layer would cause the map to lag immensely . Addition of panning and zooming listeners to fetch only the data we want at the moment has resulted in smooth loading of this layer .

### New button to choose layers :

The earlier button to choose overlay layers was not clear enough to describe its use . Often new user to the website would miss the earlier version button .
Using @warrens prototype , we came up with this :)

### Share your Location on Public Lab :

We encourage people to share their location on Public Lab and we do not take any location related information from user without their consent .
Sharing Location will help us give you a view on maps which will be personalized to only you , hence helping you to easily study your vicinity !

### New Layers :

Following layers have been added :

1.) Indigenous Lands **Languages** Layer.

2.) Indigenous Lands **Territories** Layer.

3.) Indigenous Lands **Treaties** Layer.

4.) Air Quality Index Layer.

5.) Wisconsin Non-Metal

6.) OSM Landfills, Mines, Quarries

### On going work in LEL :

- Writing perfect documentation for integration of LEL .
- Integrating new LEL features with plots2 and mapknitter .
- Refreshing maps from API calls when panning/zooming .

### Cheers to Contributors and to people using LEL :P

There is increase in people contributing to LEL on github . Also the number of stars on github has also increased .

_28 stars :)_

There is sudden increase in weekly downloads of LEL on NPM as well :
