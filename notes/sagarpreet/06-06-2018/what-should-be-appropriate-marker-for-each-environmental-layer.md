As part of Google Summer of Code program , i have been working on Leaflet Environmental Layers Library . 

I have written this note explaining each layer here : https://publiclab.org/notes/sagarpreet/06-06-2018/leaflet-environmental-layer-library?_=1528283515 

I would appreciate the help of Public Lab community to give suggestions for the type of marker that i should use for each environmental layer . especially for layers : 
*  SkyTruth  ,  
*  OdorReport , 
*  ToxicRelease

The marker should be such that they somehow relates to the information they show ?

Thank you !
