Project Title : Social Media Integration and Leaflet-Layers Library .

Gitter : 	     sagarpreet-chadha 

Portfolio :      [https://sagarpreet-chadha.github.io/][3] 

I am in my pre-final year studying Computer Science Engineering (BTech) from Delhi Technological University , India . Originally I am from a small village in **Punjab** , India but currently living in **Delhi** , India to complete my studies .  

##  Project description : 

I would love to work on Social Media Integration and part of Interactive Project Maps .
 
### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

*Adding replies from twitter post to the original node on PublicLab and also adding answers from PublicLab node to twitter as comments . Also improving the interactive maps used in PublicLab website .*

### Problem :
_What problem does your project solve?_

**PART 1 of the project :**   (Milestone :  [Social Media Integration][4]  )

People are increasingly engaging with Public Lab community and questions via Twitter . This project helps in : 

1.) Generating more content to Public Lab website .

2.) Notifying the author of the node when someone comments on the corresponding tweet of the node , as an email is send to the author because that comment is added as a comment to the original node in PL website .

3.) helping people to know more about the Public Lab community .

4.) Automating a general reply to each comment on a tweet of the form - “Thank you John Doe for your reply .”

5.) Posting all the answers from a node on Public Lab website as a comment to the corresponding post on twitter of the form - “Warren added an answer to your node on publiclab.org ”.

**PART 2 of the project :** (Milestone :  [Geographic features][5])

1.) Adding a map using leaflet javascript library to show nearby projects . 

2.)  Making all the maps used on PL website to dynamically load markers by making API . This API can be used for other useful purposes .

3.) Solving the issues related to security , i.e , not showing the markers when the zoom level exceeds the precision level of the location given by the user . 

4.) Showing project related attributes on marker and using different markers to show Projects to avoid any kind of confusion  .

5.) Solving the issue of infinite scrolling and dragging of maps to make use of maps more friendly and smooth .

6.) Making an alternate list-view of map showing nearby projects .

### Implementation

**PART 1 of the project :** 

I have already worked with Rails RSS Feed generator and integration with IFTTT recipes to generate Tweets with images .

The first step would be to change the format of the Tweets generated by IFTTT to start with a unique number (which can be the ‘uid’ of that node) , for fast searching of that node from our database.

Then using the Twitter gem , we can write an algorithm to fetch the recent replies to a tweet by @PublicLab . 

Then storing the tweet ids of these replies in a our database so that they are not processed the next time our algorithm runs .
 Also storing the tweet id of the parent post which is used to post the answers from PL website to this post as a comment . 

This algorithm will be written as RAKE file in /lib folder and then using Whenever gem (we will also be using this gem for generating EMAIL - DIGEST) we can execute this rake file after every finite interval of time .

Advantages : 

1.) We are just storing the Tweet-ids and hence less space is used . 

2.) We are making a RAKE file and hence not changing the core code . 

**Pseudo-code for the Algorithm :-)**

------------

I have created this **Demo project** : 

A.) Add a comment to this tweet here : 

[https://twitter.com/Sagarpreet_07/status/961854112450068483][7]

B.) Your comment would be shown here within 10 minutes : (To be more precise it runs every XX : X7 UTC time)

[https://pure-eyrie-27023.herokuapp.com/tweets/test][8]

C.) Also an automated reply to that comment will be generated on twitter .

* *Youtube Video showing the Demo :*

--------------


**PART 2 of the project :** 

Some of the existing issues i would like to solve :

[Location-security][9]

[Refresh map on panning and zooming][10]

[Infinite scrolling and panning of maps][11]

[Different Layers on Leaflet map](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/2486)

[SkyTruth Alerts and Full screen (in Progress)](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/2451)

[Inline map showing incorrect nodes](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/2254)

I have already worked with the leaflet javascript library to add the **/people map** and the **/profile map** and have made the API to dynamically load markers in /people map . In the same way we can show the near-by projects . 

To standardise the use of maps across PublicLab website , we should create a JS library .

I have created this **demo JS library** and published to **npm** :

GITHUB :
https://github.com/sagarpreet-chadha/Leaflet_learning

 NPM :
https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet-learning

 DEMO : 
https://sagarpreet-chadha.github.io/Leaflet_learning/
 
**DOCS OF THE Leaflet JS library :**

1.) Creating an instance / object : 

            var PLmap = new MainModule() ;

 2.) Attributes for modifying maps :

3.) To add Single - Layer Map : 

           PLmap.SkyTruth(op) ;
       	     
           PLmap.MapKnitter(op) ; 
	 
           PLmap.ToxicRelease(op) ; 
	
           PLmap.WaterReport(op) ; 
    
            and many more !


4.) To add Map with Layer button on top-right corner of map to choose combination of layers :

        PLmap.MultiLayers("SkyTruth" , "MapKnitter") ;
      
        PLmap.MultiLayers("SkyTruth" , "ToxicRelease" , "WaterReport") ; 
     
        and various other combinations !


5.) To add a CUSTOM map with your own API :
This Map can be used for : 
  
  * People Map : to show recent contributors to PublicLab.org 
  * Project Map : to show near-by projects from the current location of the user . 
  * People-Community Map : to show near-by PublicLab community people .  
 

         PLmap.CustomMap(op , "https://" + URL OF API   + ".json") ;


6.) To add Map with only 1 marker :
This Map can be used in various places across the PL website mainly : 
 
 *  Profile Map . 

        PLmap.Singleton(op) ; 

------------



The final UI of this new map will be (can be modified as per my mentors convention) : 	

  **Profile Map showing Near By Projects with a different marker .**

![image description][12]

**Page showing near by Projects in both views : map view and a list view .**

![image description][13]

**Map showing one of the Layer of various layers .**

### Passion

Belonging from a place having fresh air , pure water and green environment , and currently living in one of the most polluted city in the world - Delhi  , Yes Public Lab interests me a lot and i wish to be the part of the PublicLab family for a very long time . 

 As Larry Page once said- *“If you’re changing the world, you’re working on important things. You’re excited to get up in the morning .”*

-------
### My Outreach - Plan to bring more newcomers during my Summer Project : 

Since I am a Teaching Assistant for https://www.codingninjas.in/  , I am planning to hold free sessions for students where we can promote OSS . I will also encourage them to fork the PL repo and solve FTO issues and send a PR for the same . 

Same session will also be conducted in my university .

In this way we would not only get more developers on-board but it will also help students explore the Open-Source world as well . 

--------------

### Audience

This project will be helpful for **people engaging with Public Lab via twitter** . 

It will also help **twitter-savvy people to follow their PL tweets** of interests very closely .

The contributions by **existing Public Lab users** will be visible on twitter which will reach more audience and at the same time attract more users to Public Lab community .

This project will also help people who wants to know about the **various projects near them** . The project will also focus on **location-security** .

------

### Commitment

*I can assure you that if i get selected to work with Public Lab this summer , I will definitely try my level best to make this project successful and will love to continue working with Public Lab even after the summer .*
