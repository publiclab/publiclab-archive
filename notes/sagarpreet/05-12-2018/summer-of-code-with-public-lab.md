Hi all :)

I got selected for Google summer of code this year and this article is all about my journey .



##**How i found Public Lab ?**

My journey begins on my 20th birthday , I had my university exams going on and i had no mood to study on that day .
Luckily i had met a friend of mine the previous day who told me about this program — Google summer of code . 
Somehow i started reading more about GSOC and then i started looking at some Open-Source Projects and i found — Public Lab ❤ !

 I forked the project PLOTS2 and started looking for some First-Timer issues .



##**Why made me choose Public Lab ?**

The community is really welcoming to first timers . There are many quality First-Timers-Only issues which are beautifully constructed telling you everything you need to know to solve that issue . 
The mentors are really supportive and helpful and are full of amazing ideas .

I still remember that feeling when one of my contribution went Live on the website .
One of my contribution prior to GSOC selection .
