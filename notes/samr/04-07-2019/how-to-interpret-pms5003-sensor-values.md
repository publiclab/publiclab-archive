# How to interpret PMS5003 sensor values?

hi. we are trying to use the pms5003 sensor for a school project to take air quality measurements. We don't have much experience with air quality measurements/standards. Can you explain in simple terms what the 12 data values are that this sensor reports back ?

For example, the first 6 are two sets of PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations. the first set are labeled "standard", while the second set are labeled "atmospheric environment". What do these measure and how do the "standard" ones differ from the "atmospheric environment" ones?

And then there are six particle counts which we are assuming estimate the number of particles of the particular size in a 0.1L volume of air?

Also, how would one take the quantitative readings from the sensor and translate them into some qualitative air quality index scale (like good aq, moderate pollution/acceptable aq, unhealthy for sensitive groups, unhealthy, very unhealthy, hazardous).

thank you very much in advance for any assistance you might be able to offer us!
