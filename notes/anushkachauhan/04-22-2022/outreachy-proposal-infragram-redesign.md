## Project description

  
### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

Design a new modern interface for Infragram.org, making the website more user-friendly and easier to navigate.  

  
### Problem

**1\. The website's visual design is lacking.** 

  
- It looks congested, with too much information.
  - It does not have a clear hierarchy in components.
  - The design does not go with the modern design principles.
  - It has more than two CTAs (call-to-action buttons).
- There are too many links in the text.
  - There are links to information about infragram and public lab → Create an About page
  - There are links to Public Lab products like DIY Filter Pack, pre-modified Point and Shoot Infragram Camera → Create a Products page
- The Q&A section is not required on the landing page → Create a Help page
- The footer is not very informative.
  - We can make it more eye pleasing.
  - We can add copyrights, privacy policy, contact, navigation to different pages, social icons, etc.

**2\. The Infragram tool is not intuitive to use.**

  
- The user should have the information on how to use the tool without searching.
  - Add a popup modal that explains the tool and the various options and filters available.
  - Add a sequenced 'Tutorial' that points at different options and explains their function.

  
**3\. User has to browse and select an image in Infragram tool**

  
- Allow cross-browser drag and drop on the entire page instead of just selecting an image.

**4\. The current website is not mobile friendly.**

  
- Make a mobile responsive design that incorporates:
  - A toggleable nav menu
  - Readjusted content that is properly visible![image description](/i/46491.png "mobile-design.png")

### Needs

I would appreciate constant feedback from the mentors on questions relevant to the organization. This will help me know the users and what their needs are better. 

  
If there are any guidelines on coding convention or syntax, I would require that as well.

  
### First-time contribution

My first contribution to public lab: [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/10858](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/10858)

### Experience

I've been learning programming for 3-4 years now. It is an essential part of my major and also something I enjoy. My interest in Website Design and Development started from my design journey. I explored UI/UX Design and became curious about what happens behind the screen -- how wireframes on paper or figma are converted to code.

  
I did various courses on Coursera learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, ReactJS and started solving challenges like building clones of popular apps etc. I've done two internships in web development, which gave me the confidence to write code that would be used by real customers someday.

### Teamwork

In the case of **closed source**, I have worked with a team for one of my internships. Here, each member was assigned something different. 

  
I was responsible for the frontend development of the customer application. Once that was done, we could integrate the backend and start the testing. I am happy to say that I delivered the expected results and even helped my team members with some common tasks.

  
When it comes to **open source**, I have contributed to some organisations such as [mdn-content](https://github.com/mdn/content), [moja-global](https://github.com/moja-global/community-website) etc. I have also participated in GirlScript Summer of Code 2022 and made several contributions while communicating with mentors and other participants.

  
One of the bugs I fixed under moja-global that I'm quite proud of: [https://github.com/moja-global/community-website/pull/306](https://github.com/moja-global/community-website/pull/306) (This PR shows my keen observation skills and how well I can document my changes.)

### Passion

I'm very passionate about environmental concerns and wildlife conservation. I have always held the belief that this planet belongs to all of us and that humans must learn to share it with the other species. We must learn to co-exist and we must learn to respect the gift that is mother nature.

  
The existence of life on Earth is a miracle. So many factors come together to form this amazing planet. And we, as a civilization, must stop being incredibly foolish by destroying it.

  
I find the mission of Public Lab _**"pursuing environmental justice through community science and open technology"**_ very inspiring and productive. It is spreading knowledge and raising awareness among the local public and communities, which is very important at this hour.\\

  
### Audience

I read that "Citizen science is the powerful idea that communities should be empowered to participate in the process of scientific inquiry, investigating the world around them and creating societal change in the process."

  
Public Lab is one of the leading organizations focusing on this. Their users are common people who want to know more about their world. I want to help them with their curiosity and I want to help them make an impact.

  
Also, I am very intrigued with the concept of inclusive design. I want to incorporate that in this project and make it inclusive for people with disabilities by using [Accessibility Principles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/).

  
That includes having:

- Keyboard compatibility
- Colours with good contrast
- Clear layout and design
- Large links, buttons and controls
- Customizable text

  
### Commitment

Yes, I understand that this is a serious commitment and I'm prepared to give it my very best. I will follow the timeline and try to complete major tasks in the early stages only. 

  
I'll work on the code full time on weekdays and review it (and add any additional documentation) on weekends. My awake hours would usually be between 9 AM IST (3:30 AM UTC) to 12 AM IST (6:30 PM UTC). I can easily dedicate 30-40 hours per week.
