I'm Noah, the Documentation fellow for the currently unnamed Minnesota Wild Rice Protection Team. We're just getting started, and I have been thinking about the best ways to interact with the communities affected by the proposed Huber OSB Factory and the Talon-Rio Tinto Mine. I want to make sure that the content we have on our page is relevant and helpful for communities to help learn more about these projects and the effects they may have. Does anyone have any advice about the best ways for to do this on our upcoming project page?
