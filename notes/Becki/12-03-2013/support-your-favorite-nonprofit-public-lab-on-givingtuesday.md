**Thank you so much for your help making 2013 the best year yet for Public Lab! **

Your support, and the contributions and support from thousands of other community members around the world, have resulted in amazing accomplishments this year:

--After 22 months of diligence and paperwork, we have received our 501(c)3 status approval;

--Thanks to the work of the Public Lab community, we were named an Honorable Mention in the 2013 Buckminster Fuller Challenge, "Socially-Responsible Design's Highest Award"; 

--Through our partnership with Google Earth Outreach, and because of the amazing maps created by people like you, we have achieved full integration of public domain maps into Google Earth; 

--With important contributions from dozens of community members and 1,500+ backers, we launched Infragram--our DIY infrared photography project; 

--2013 saw our largest Barnraising to date! Hosted in New Orleans, we brought 50 people together from as far away as Israel and London to work on tools and explore how they can be used for formal and informal education.     

All this is supported by the Public Lab nonprofit, which works to grow the community and ensure tools reach under-resourced communities where they are needed most. As a nonprofit, our work is made possible through generous support from private foundations and our community of individual supporters like you.
