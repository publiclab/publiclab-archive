Public Lab is happy to announce our continued partnership with Autodesk Foundation Fund, a corporate advised fund of Silicon Valley Community Foundation, to support the overall ongoing mission and activities of Public Lab. With their support, Public Lab will continue to improve structures that help diverse groups of people answer environmental questions through the design, testing and use of low-cost environmental monitoring hardware. The partnership will result in a pipeline of innovative, market-ready environmental monitoring toolkits that can be used by anyone to answer environmental questions and advocate for healthier communities. Public Lab looks forward to continuing this important work throughout 2017!
