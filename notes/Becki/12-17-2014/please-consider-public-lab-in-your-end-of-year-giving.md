**Public Lab is more than a collection of innovative tools for monitoring your environment.**

We are concerned residents of Menomonie, WI working to hold fracking companies accountable for the silica pollution from sand mines that is inundating homes and schools.

We are creative thinkers in Somerville, MA developing simple, DIY ways to monitor sewage and waste pollution in the Mystic River.

We are an international team of researchers and organizers helping low-income families suffering from formaldehyde toxicity to work together for better air quality.

**We are a global network of people working together to build healthier communities.**

2014 has been a year of amazing growth for Public Lab and we could not have done it without our community, partners, and donors. We have made important progress in helping communities collect evidence about dirty air and water where they live. Now, we need your support as we look toward an even bigger year in 2015.

**[Join Public Lab today!](https://secure.lglforms.com/form_engine/s/pbXczj9cZ9B72z41PIFYgw)**
