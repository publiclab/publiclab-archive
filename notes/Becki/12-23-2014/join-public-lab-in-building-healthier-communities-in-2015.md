Show your support for polluter accountability and healthy communities in 2015 by making a tax deductible donation to Public Lab. **Over the holiday season, our goal is to raise $5,000 in individual donations.** Thanks to your generosity on #GivingTuesday, we’re 20% of the way there - help us reach our goal by December 31st!

Your contribution will support communities working toward cleaner, healthier futures - like our partners in Menomonie, WI, standing up to fracking companies to hold them accountable for the silica pollution inundating local homes and schools. Thanks to the creativity and brainpower of the Public Lab community, residents there are starting to feel like progress is being made. At a workshop just last month where we collaborated with neighbors to build low-cost dust monitors, a community member expressed relief at the progress being made:

_“For quite a while now, activists concerned about sand mining have been getting discouraged because there's a lot of fatalism, people in the community who feel that nothing they do can make a difference. And seeing 140-160 mines rotting the land is good reason for pessimism. However, I felt hope rekindling Monday evening. That felt like fresh air.”_

This is a testament to the impact of the work we, as members of the Public Lab community, are having in countless communities around the world. Join us today in building hope for cleaner, healthier communities in 2015!

**Best wishes for a happy, healthy holiday season,**
