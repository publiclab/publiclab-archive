Hey Public Labbers,

I hope everyone's December is off to a great start today. I know myself and others are feeling especially energized from all the great conversations and connections that happened at Barnraising a few short weeks ago.

As we move into December, Public Lab is launching it's annual end of year fundraising appeal. Our goal this year is to raise $5,000 in individual donations by December 31st. Since December 1 is #GivingTuesday, we're kicking things off today! Giving Tuesday is a global day of giving -- now that everyone has gotten their holiday deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday itâ€™s time to support the nonprofits that matter to us. We hope Public Lab comes to mind for each of you as you consider end of year gifts to the nonprofits working hard to make the world a healthier, more equitable place.

Take part in this global day of giving and support Public Lab at the same time. Thank you so much for making our work possible!

All the best,
Becki
