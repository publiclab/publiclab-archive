As many of you know, we've been working hard in the second half of 2014 to launch a Sustaining Members program in order to diversify, and ultimately make more sustainable, our financial resources as a nonprofit. While we are so, so, so appreciative of the support we receive from our larger partners, we also rely on every contributions from our community to keep Public Lab going. 

In an effort to say thanks, and to give you a way to show off you support for Public Lab, we've created membership levels that earn you great, unique pieces of Public Lab gear. Just last week the shirts associated with our $100 membership level -- the Phosphorescent Phylum -- made their way to our Portland office. These great shirts were designed by Public Lab staff and printed by  [EvolTwin](http://www.evoltwinprinting.com/) on 100% organic cotton tees.
