Public Lab is excited to announce our new partnership with the EPA Urban Waters Program and Region 6 to monitor eight wetland restoration sites around New Orleans.

Through the partnership, we will train community members and wetland restoration advocates to monitor and track progress at eight ongoing urban wetland restoration projects near Lake Pontchartrain. The training will include introduction to basic science, technology, engineering, and math concepts through real-life application of environmental monitoring tools and techniques. Community members will learn how to use Public Lab's DIY aerial mapping toolkit to build maps of the restoration projects that show progress of the sites overtime, providing important benchmarks for the organizations working to restore the Gulf Coast.
