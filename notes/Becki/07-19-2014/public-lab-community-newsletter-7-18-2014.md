**Hot topics on the mailing lists**

A conversation started in the mailing lists, with answers being organized [via a research note](http://publiclab.org/notes/bsugar/07-18-2014/a-catalogue-of-civic-open-source-hardware-projects), has bsugar wondering what other civic open hardware projects are out there besides Public Lab?  

**Public Lab in the media**

A [cool mention in The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2014/jul/18/hacking-journalism-at-the-mit-media-lab) of the RIFFLE and LilyBui's talk on "Sensor Journalism, Uncensored" at MIT's Hacking Journalism conference.
