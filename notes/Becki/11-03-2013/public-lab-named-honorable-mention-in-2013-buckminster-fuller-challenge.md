Public Lab is proud to be selected as an [Honorable Mention](http://challenge.bfi.org/2013Finalist_PublicLab) amongst a great group of Finalists for the Buckminster Fuller Challenge! We received some great compliments from review team--thanks everyone for your hardwork and dedication!

"Public Lab is the most impressive and effective effort at 'democratizing' science and building a grassroots network of 'citizen scientists' for very positive ends that we have come across...Public Lab is probably the most effective open source tool platform we have seen come through the Challenge, and certainly the one that is doing the most unambiguous good. It is a bold, visionary initiative run by a highly intelligent, creative, committed team. It has already produced some impressive outcomes and could very well spread virally and help empower communities around the world hold polluters accountable."
