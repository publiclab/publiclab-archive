# Help Public Lab raise $2,014 by 2014!

**Did you know that in 2013 [www.publiclab.org](www.publiclab.org) was visited by over 236,000 people in 110 countries, from every continent except Antarctica?  **
 
Thank you again for your help making 2013 the best year yet for Public Lab! [Click here](http://publiclab.org/wiki/2013-slideshow) to see some of our community's other great accomplishments from 2013, from helping stall evictions at a craft market in Uganda to distributing over 3,000 DIY spectrometers.

Now, we need your support as we look toward an even bigger year in 2014! Help us keep this momentum going as we grow our open source spectral library, design new hardware for water and air quality monitoring, make important platform improvements to Spectral Workbench, MapKnitter, and Infragram.org, and launch new projects in the Gulf Coast and Northeast in partnership with Patagonia Clothing Company, the Environmental Leadership Program, and the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation.
 
**[PLEASE GIVE TODAY](https://www.wepay.com/donations/publiclab-donations)**

There are only eight days left in 2013 to make a contribution to Public Lab. We are 36% of the way toward meeting our end of year fundraising goal of $2,014--help us reach it by donating today! 

Have a great holiday season!
Shannon, Jeff, Mathew, Liz, Stewart, Becki and Noah
