I'm excited to share with you the great full color decals that just came in for our new [Sustaining Members](http://publiclab.org/donate) program! Designed by our very own Jeff Warren and produced by Portland print shop [BikePunk](http://www.bikepunk.com/), these weather resistant decals will be included with all $15 membership commitments. [Get yours today](http://store.publiclab.org/collections/gifts-donations/products/donate) by joining at the Rhizome level!
