As you all know, none of the work we do would be possible without you--the Public Lab community. Your dedicated, on-the-ground work supports tool development and leads to real wins on the ground in your community. Collectively, we are impacting people and neighborhoods on a GLOBAL scale!! 

Behind the curtain, supporting all this work, is the Public Lab nonprofit. We run largely on love, y'alls energy, and the support of our generous donors. To this end, we have just launched our first ever midyear fundraising appeal. We're asking for your assistance-make a donation or spread the word to your networks via email, Facebook, or Twitter--to help us continue to grow our community of contributors and supporters.
