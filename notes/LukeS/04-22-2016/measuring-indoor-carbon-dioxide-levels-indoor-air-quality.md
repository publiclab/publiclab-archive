###What I want to do
I wrote a how-to article describing the step by step process needed to accurately measure indoor carbon dioxide levels which is a component of indoor air quality.  All supplies can be purchased for about $50 total which will give you ten CO2 tests.

###Supplies & Cost
RAE System 10-104-30 carbon dioxide colorimetric detection tubes - $35 plus shipping

100 mL syringe with tube - $10
