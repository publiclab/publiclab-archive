Hi! I'm a games researcher at Northeastern University, and my lab is studying a citizen science game that we've developed.

We're looking for participants for our user study, and if you have an hour, we'd love to have you! (You'll also receive $15 for your time).

One unfortunate sticking point is that you do need an Android phone + some printed materials in order to participate.
