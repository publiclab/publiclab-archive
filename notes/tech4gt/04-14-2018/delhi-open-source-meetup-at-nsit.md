I planned and hosted a small Open source meetup at my college Netaji Subhash Institute if Technology in New Delhi India. It was a meetup for the students of my college only and we had about 50-60 attendees. Objective of the meetup was to share our work on Image Sequencer, which was thoroughly enjoyed. People loved how Image Processing is being done in js rather than python.

# Event

We started the event with our Introductions and then moved on to how Open source in general works. We covered a little bit of git and github and how our code style need to match the style of the codebase.

Manish then talked a little bit about fossasia codeheat and his journey through it

I talked about publiclab and what the organization does, then moved on to Image Sequencer. Some attendees really appreciated the way our codebase was completely js with no traces of python which can make Image Processing much easier. I talked about the edge-detection module in partcular and it was much appreciated.

We had informal discussions about the projects we are working on and had some laughs.

### Stickers and schwags

Let's face it, best part of every open source meetup is the swags right and we were able to distribute some, courtesy of Manish Devgan and Liz from Publiclab.

# Conclusion

In all it was a great event which was thoroughly enjoyed by both the Listeners and the Speakers, especially for someone like me who has not hosted a lot of meetups it was a very nice and enjoyable experience. I would like to thank Publiclab and Manish Devgan for helping out so much :)
