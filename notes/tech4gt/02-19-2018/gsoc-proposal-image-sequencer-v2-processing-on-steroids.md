## Project description

_Image Sequencer is a sequential image processing library completely written in javascript which currently supports Node.js and the browser. It has the capability of outputting the processed image at each step as well as a CLI for ease of use right from the terminal._

## Abstract/summary:

_Goal of the project is enhancing Image-Sequencer for both users and contributors by adding more modules, enhancing existing ones, improvisations on demo, an even better CLI and an a plugins system to make module contribution easier and independent._

## Problem

- The current module contribution system needs for you to clone the code and make changes to it and generate a pull request, this is not a solution viable for ling term because the source code size would keep on increasing, also if a user does not wish to use all the modules he/she would have to download all of them, this also makes debugging difficult.
- Current demo is not very feature rich and needs improvements in various areas, for instance it doeas not support caching of files for offline use, sharing directly from the demo and the UI can use some improvements as well
- The current CLI syntax is long and tedious, does not support naming of the output image and hence chainability is not very effective. For instance currently to chain the cli with moving the final image to a new location looks like this

```
sequencer -i "image path" -o "path to output directory" -s "steps" && mv "output path/sequencer
```

- Some modules need very high computational power and the CPU is falling short, Edge Detection for instance takes incredibly long times to process for higher resolution images and hence these calculations should be GPU accelerated
- The project is not setup with stuff like codecov, codeclimate and others
- Mobile browsers and lower grade hardware have a hard time processing images due to limited processing power and thermal limitations, also long processing times give an unsatisfactory user experience especially on mobile devices.

According to statistics a considerable amount of users are using devices with low processing power, especially in under privileged communities and developing countries. This hardware can simply not run heavy modules locally.(in many cases mobile devices is the only device people own)

## Proposed Solutions

### Adding a plugin system ([Issue 190](https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues/190))

Making it easier for people to develop modules independently, the modules will be divided into 2 categories, _Core Modules_ and _Plugin Modules_

- Core modules would be bundled with the source code and they would provide a basic set of functions
- Plugin modules would be more complex and would not be bundled with the source code but would be installed via _NPM_ and then can be binded with the main project to customize Image Sequencer according to needs
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25617855/37243382-480e8216-249e-11e8-9b73-9d0dde341dd1.jpeg)

Currently the modules are hardcoded into the modules.js file but by having a modules.json file which will contain the details for all the modules currently bound to the system and modules.js will load its modules based on the information from this file and being a json file more modules can be dynamically added and removed

Building a CLI Around the new architecture so that non technical users can directly add modules from the CLI, after completion this will be the workflow

```
npm i image-sequencer
npm i sequencer-blur
sequencer --bind-module sequencer-blur
sequencer -i "
```

Adding a one line module building option using the dynamic module

### RESTful API ([Issue 198](https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues/198))

An express server and a RESTful api for clients with low processing power. This expands the reach of the project to a much wider audience particularly people who cannot afford higher tier hardware to run complex modules like Edge Detection.This also provides a new way of using image sequencer and opens the project up for future clients such as native apps. Also the user will have an option in the UI to use local machine or remote server for processing and a time threshold in which if the processing does not complete the code will fallback to using API. Images will be uploaded to imgur api and link will be sent to the api. API structure is listed below:

#### `/api/v1/convert`

```
Request body:
{
    image: String,
    steps : [String],
}

Response body:

{
    images : [String]
}
```

### CLI Improvements

Refactor the cli and add `-n --out-name` option to name the final output image, by default this will be set to the name of the input image. Extension detection and conversion to seamlessly convert between file formats without even specifying the convert step. The syntax for the above example will look like

```
sequencer -i "photo.jpg" -s "steps" -o "out dir" && mv "outdir/photo.jpg" "target dir"
```

A conflict of name will be resolved by prompting the user for a new name and by default adding appropriate number to the name of the image

Also using the `-n` option for automatic extension detection the following command will invoke the proposed jpg to png module on the final image and export it as a png image

```
sequencer -i "photo.jpg" -n "photo.png -s "steps""
```

- Setup the project with CodeCov, bithound,codefactor, codeclimate and codebeat to increase code maintainability and quality. A deploy to heroku button for quickly deploying and testing our newly created server on heroku
Documentaion should look something like this

## Linting

Since linting is a very important part of development workflow and ensuring code quality, the code written would be properly linted in order to be less bug prone and better readability. Also I would add proper comments so as to make the code easier to understand for new contributors

## Timeline/milestones (May 14 - Aug 6)

My semester exams end around 30 May and hence I would not be able to do very significant contributions in the first one-two weeks but I will make up for it in the following weeks(Link to my academic calendar : [http://www.nsit.ac.in/static/documents/calender/UG/calender\_B.E. even semester 2018.pdf](http://www.nsit.ac.in/static/documents/calender/UG/calender_B.E.%20even%20semester%202018.pdf)

## Experience

I am a Node.js based web and android developer, a javascript and kotlin lover and contributer to various open source projects as well as author of some.

I interned at open source organization [Coding Blocks](https://github.com/coding-blocks) for the better part of 2 years where I helped with open source development of Node and Android projects and acted as a teaching assistant for the bootcamps. Below is a list of my most notable projects

### 1\. Passport-Oneauth :

A custom passport OAuth2 strategy written in javascript for coding blocks' [Oneauth](https://github.com/coding-blocks/oneauth) Server which plugs into the [passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) middleware and provides authentication for the OAuth2 compliant server oneauth, inspired by [passport-facebook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-facebook) and [passport-google-oauth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-google-oauth) (Authored)

**npm**: [https://npmjs.com/package/passport-oneauth](https://npmjs.com/package/passport-oneauth)

**github**: [https://github.com/coding-blocks/passport-oneauth](https://github.com/coding-blocks/passport-oneauth)

### 2\. Shortlr :

### 4\. Chrome Extension for shortlr :

A chrome extension that shorts a url using the shortlr API and copies it to user's clipboard (**Authored**)

**github**: [https://github.com/coding-blocks/shortlr\_chrome\_extension](https://github.com/coding-blocks/shortlr_chrome_extension)

## Teamwork

_I was a part of the coding blocks organization where we teach students how to code. All the code written here is open source and i worked with the team of interns on many open source projects some of which are mentioned above. Apart from that I also helped students learn as teaching assistant in the bootcamps "Data structures and algorithms in java" and "Android App Development". I cleared doubts and helped people debug their code and hence I have complete understanding of working in a team, respecting other members' opinions and maintaining protocol. I understand the importance of team work in any great project._

# 

## Outreach\_I strongly believe in sharing knowledge and collective growth, I have tried to encourage other contributors and newcomers to contribute to the project through opening FTO(First Timers Only) issues([List Here](https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is:issue%20author:tech4GT%20label:first-timers-only%20)) and I would continue to do so. I will allow for newcomers to contribute to the project by breaking up tasks into smaller pieces and opening FTO issues for easier tasks. Also a part of my proposal is to allow for independent module development so that developers can make modules for image-sequencer without going through the process of getting it approved, also they would be able to publish their modules separately if they want to. I would love to work with other people on the project and i will try to make the project as developer friendly as possible.

## Passion

_I am a javascript lover and an Image processing enthusiast. The way we can change an entire picture by simple mathematical transformations is just fascinating for me and hence i love Image Sequencer. I also admire the way we can apply image processing in real life to get various types of information from plant and soil health to particles in water._

## Audience

_I believe this project can be helpful to small scale farmers and peasants where the health of their crops and soil can be analyzed and especially in a country like india where majority of the people cannot afford to buy expensive equipment and pay loads of money for analysis._

## Commitment

_I completely understand the commitment here and I would love to commit myself to this project and grow as a programmer, I currently spend almost 6 hours a day on open source development I am willing to devote any amount of time required for the program and since the program overlaps with my semester break it would be possible to do so._
