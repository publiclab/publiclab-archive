I am new to spectometry and to developing with this Xplained Pro kit but received a green light from my professor to build such a spectrometer.  I want to make this accessible for addicts, first responders and in Vancouver, BC we have safe injection sites so staff who work there.  Currently the city of Vancouver only has two spectrometers while the opioid crisis continues.  Please feel free to share any insight or advice you may have.  Thank you.
