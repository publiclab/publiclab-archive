## About me

_Hey, my name is Batracov Dmitry and I'm web developer. The main language in which I code is ruby. Of course I've some experience in javascript(jQuery), some C/C++ on University level and java in this semester started to learn. I'm interested in: golang and python after couple of years I'll learn them._

**Affiliation** (organization/school, if any)

**Location:** (Republic of Moldova, Chisinau(It's between Romania and Ukraine))

## Project description

_I think I and my mentor will talk about this task later, but overall how is written issues I will use m_ailman or something similar to him. This all will work with ActiveJob(I think gem sidekiq will be helpful). And I don't know which tool your team use in production but I know that sidekiq after some time use too much memory and we should it restart manually. For automation restart we can use Cron or Monit(I'd some experience with that tool).

### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

### Problem

_My project will add advanced feature for email. _

### Timeline/milestones

_Break your project up into small projects -- one per week!_

### Needs

_Only the concomitant direction of the mentor is needed_  

### Setup

_I've installed and run on my pc_

---------

### Experience

_It will be my first contribution but not last, How I said in topic "about me" I am familiar with ruby and javascript. This all I've learned by myself. I have some projects on github: github.com/Dmitry96\. They're a little bit old, after 1-2 weeks when I a little bit will free I want to start my project. I don't know what it will be, but I want to test some tech, like: rabbitmq, websockets and couple of gems._

---------

### Teamwork

Only with my friend, but I know how to work with git, it's now a problem.

---------

### Passion

I think all projects should be opensource and I just want to prove to myself that I can work and quickly learn new tech.

Audience  

_For all people_

### Commitment

_Only students can participate in GSoC and I'm free during 3 moths._

_I think the best way is to make every 1-2 weeks some commits, t__o keep a mentor in the know that I'm doing something._

_For example: first week, I've successfully added sidekiq in project and some gems etc ..._

_And further if I will end this task earlier I can help with OAUTH via some Social Networks_
