Have you published your projects or results, whether here, in a journal, or other forms of publication? If so, we would love to hear about it! My name is Sarah, I am working with Dr. Gwen Ottinger at Drexel University, and we are conducting a research study about Citizen Science and Peer Review. If you would be interested in participating in our research please reach out to me ([ses392@drexel.edu](mailto:ses392@drexel.edu)) or Dr. Gwen Ottinger ([ottinger@drexel.edu](mailto:ottinger@drexel.edu)) for more information.
