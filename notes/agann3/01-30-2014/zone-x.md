I want to uncover the potential stimulation of urban revitalization within an area demarcated on the FEMA flood maps called Zone X, which claims to be "protected by the levees but subject to flood during extreme floods" 

This week, I am attempting to collect more data to support the importance of redeveloping this area to be more adaptive and responsive, infrastructurally and architecturally. 

What damage would it do if it were to flood?
What is the potential to re-establish, now covered and piped, Bayou Gayoso as a creek landscape. 

I am moving to Memphis, TN upon graduation.
