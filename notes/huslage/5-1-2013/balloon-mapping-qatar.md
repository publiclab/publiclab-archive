We launched a Balloon at the Al Dhakira Mangroves in Qatar on April 23rd! This was in support of the larger <a href="http://mappingthemangroves.org">Mapping The Mangroves</a> project sponsored by <a href="http://qfi.org">Qatar Foundation International</a> and <a href="http://conservation.org">Conservation International</a>. PLOTS kindly overnighted me a Balloon Mapping Kit to take on the trip. We are using the data gathered to improve the imagery of the site, measure seasonal effects of mangrove trees and to improve awareness of the importance of mangroves to the world's ocean ecosystem.
