##Details about the problem

On our recent balloon mapping expedition in Qatar, we used a GoPro Hero3 Black to capture images. This camera doesn't put any lens information into the EXIF data, so post-processing the images is quite difficult.

I've tried to use photoshop's "Lens Correction" filter to remove the distortion:

but this produces sub-par results:

And even after doing this in Photoshop, creating the [map](https://mapknitter.org/map/view/al-dhakira-mangroves) proves labor intensive at best. I'd like to hear any ideas about how to combat this problem and how to correct things properly.
