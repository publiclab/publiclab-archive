This is regarding the work done by Divya Baid (divyabaid16) from 22 June - 21 July, i.e between the second phase of GSoC.

In this phase, I mostly worked upon the enhancement of Mapknitter 3's UI. I solved several bugs regarding UI.

Apart from that, my PR for image ordering in the sidebar got merged.

I also worked upon the Image version control system for which I will soon be writing a technical blog in detail showing how I proceeded with it and completed it.

I am thankful to all my mentors for helping me whenever I got stuck. Especially to Cess, Jeff, Gaurav, Sasha.
