I have just designed a basic structure of footer that incorporates everything as in the present footer.

I have tried to make the background color and the text color of the Header and the footer lookalike. Also, apart from that, I have added social weblinks as icons and changed the language section![image description](/i/30821.png "Selection_102.png")

  
I would love your suggestion and feedback here.
