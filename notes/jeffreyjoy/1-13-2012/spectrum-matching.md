RE: Spectrometer kit and the using public data to perform identification of images produced.   http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/spectrometer

As a general observation, it seems to me that assembling a spectrum library and matching should be similar to the way Soundhound can ID audio clips by distinctive peak matching.   

Google translate uses existing wealth of translated documents upon which to base its translations.  Mining the existing spectrographs from scientific journals and industrial data via Google might be something that Google Labs may be interested in participating in to support this publiclaboratory.org project.

Once public databases of spectrographs are located, then this may be sufficiently interesting to convince Soundhound to allow use of its algorithm for this project.   

In both cases, the commercial entities may be willing to assist because this has the potential of being a whole new market area for each of them, even though it is presently only philanthropic.
