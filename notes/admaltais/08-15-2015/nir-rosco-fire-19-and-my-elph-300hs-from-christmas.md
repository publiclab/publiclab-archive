###What I want to do
Monitoring crops

###My attempt and results
Replacing the original filter in my elph 300HS by the Rosco Fire Filter.
Great, the opening is quite easy, the old filter has been removed, the new fit perfectly in place, everything is closed, everything is sealed, CHDK and all...!

Ok test! Well, it is pink-red, only pink-red! Not the splendid blue-orange as we can see on the beautiful photos on infragram website, no, just pink-red!
Here the NIR photo along with the useless NDVI version (NDVIBlu2RedWB.lut)
Ok, that was not the real Rosco filter from the Infragram kit ([Roscolux Fire #19](https://www.rosco.com/filters/SED.cfm?titleName=R19:%20Fire&imageName=../images/filters/roscolux/19.jpg)), it's only a flash gel, one from the package of the "artistic picture fun", this one: [E-Colour #019: Fire](https://www.rosco.com/filters/SED.cfm?titleName=E019:%20Fire&imageName=../images/filters/ecolourplus/019.jpg).
But it's still a Rosco Fire #19!

###Questions and next steps
Is it possible that there would be some small difference between the filters? Does it have to be exactly the one sold in the kit?
On the Infragram.org sandbox app, do I just need to put my jpg or raw image or I need to do something before with any image software?

Thanks a lot
*The Infragram kit is on the way!

Cheers from Montr√©al
