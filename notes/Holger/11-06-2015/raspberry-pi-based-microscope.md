Hey there,

I am currently working on a rasperry pi based microscope. So far I had posted descriptions of two prototypes on_ Instructables_ ( [http://www.instructables.com/id/ARPM-Another-raspberry-pi-microscope-made-from-Ple/]  ), but I am trying to construct a simplified version as the base for a  a building kit. 

Have a look and me know if you might be interested to offer this as a kit in the US. Estimated hardware costs, including camera, would be about 40-50 US$, maybe a bit less on larger volumes.   

Kind regards

Holger
