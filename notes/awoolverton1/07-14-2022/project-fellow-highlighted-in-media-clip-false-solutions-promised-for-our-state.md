[Travis London](https://publiclab.org/profile/TravisLondon), the [Game-Over-Formosa](https://publiclab.org/wiki/game-over-formosa-plastics)
project fellow, was featured in last month's [NBC News story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aHH_iYNecU) covering
Louisiana's ongoing environmental crisis --and one hotly-debated solution.

"You can see a
lot of impact," Travis told the reporter, as he described the Purple Air
monitors that the Public Lab team has set up outside of homes in St. James
parish. These small-scale, inexpensive monitors capture ambient levels of
industrial pollutants, where state and federal agencies have failed to monitor.

Travis was featured
alongside Sharon Lavigne, an [internationally
recognized](https://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/sharon-lavigne/ "https://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/sharon-lavigne/") environmental activist, who has spearheaded the environmental
movement in Louisiana's River Parishes through her organization [RISE St. James](https://www.risestjames.org/). For years, Sharon and
her community have fought petrochemical expansion in their community. And, some
small battles have been won. The proposed Formosa Plastics facility has been [halted](https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/08/19/army-corps-orders-environmental-review-of-proposed-formosa-plastics-plant-in-louisianas-cancer-alley/ "https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/08/19/army-corps-orders-environmental-review-of-proposed-formosa-plastics-plant-in-louisianas-cancer-alley/")
until a full Environmental Impact Statement has been conducted, a decision by
the Army Corps of Engineers that signaled the Biden Administration's
willingness to take action and spurred Public Lab's Game-Over-Formosa project.
But with new petrochemical facilities continually [slated for
development](https://gov.louisiana.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/1734) and state leaders who [refute](https://www.nola.com/news/environment/article_98b5dd56-665c-11eb-993d-ab9537e3b12f.html "https://www.nola.com/news/environment/article_98b5dd56-665c-11eb-993d-ab9537e3b12f.html")
industrial culpability in the region's [health crisis](https://www.lsuhsc.edu/newsroom/LSU%20Health%20New%20Orleans%20LA%20Tumor%20Registry%20Releases%204th%20Census%20Tract%20Cancer%20Incidence%20Report.html), the fight is far from
over.

To complicate the
matter further, Governor Edwards has proposed a solution to curb carbon
emissions that environmental activists claim may make matters worse: [blue
hydrogen](https://www.nola.com/news/environment/article_d1cb3742-35a7-11ec-a6ab-afd0bb762ab9.html "https://www.nola.com/news/environment/article_d1cb3742-35a7-11ec-a6ab-afd0bb762ab9.html"). Low carbon, or "blue," hydrogen is produced by using
carbon capture technology to sequester greenhouse gasses emitted in the
production process and store them deep underground. The result is liquid fuel
that leaves behind only water.

An opportunity to
reduce the greenhouse gas emissions while increasing industrial investment? For
a quickly-eroding coastal state, it sounds too good to be true.

And, in October of
last year, Edwards unveiled plans for a [$4.5 billion](https://gov.louisiana.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/3421)
blue hydrogen plan to be constructed in Ascension Parish, near St. James. As
the first carbon capture project in the state and one of the [largest
in the world](https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/business/article_711aa81e-2d0b-11ec-b4db-ff8a4e7c6569.html), the facility will "help the state of Louisiana play a
key role in the energy transition," Air Products and Chemicals
spokesperson tells NBC news.

Yet, environmental
activists argue that blue hydrogen technology is not the solution many have
claimed it to be. Rather, carbon capture and sequestration is mere
green-washing, many claim, designed to keep the fossil fuel industry entrenched
in Louisiana's economy for decades to come, as renewable energy sources gain popularity.

This is because the
process to make blue hydrogen is extremely energy-intensive. A recent [study](https://doi.org/10.1002/ese3.956) found that, throughout its
lifecycle, blue hydrogen may emit more greenhouse gases than traditional
natural gas. This is because it retains only [70-75%](https://theconversation.com/blue-hydrogen-what-is-it-and-should-it-replace-natural-gas-166053)
of the potential heat stored in the natural gas from which it was derived.
Another study found burning blue hydrogen to be [20% worse](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ese3.692 "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ese3.692") for
the climate, since it emits methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent that CO2\.

What's more, the
fossil fuel industry threatens Louisianans' way of life, not only by
contributing to climate change, but by the immediate [environmental
degradation](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/12/louisiana-pipeline-oil-spill-new-orleans).Webs of pipelines have damaged the coastline are prone to
leaks. To make blue hydrogen, both extracted natural gas and methane waste must
pass through "reformers, pipelines and ships, providing added [opportunities
for leaks](https://theconversation.com/blue-hydrogen-what-is-it-and-should-it-replace-natural-gas-166053 "https://theconversation.com/blue-hydrogen-what-is-it-and-should-it-replace-natural-gas-166053")." Carbon capture, New Orleans one resident tells NBC news,
is just an excuse "to ignore the fact that we have to stop using fossil
fuels."

In Louisiana,
citizen-scientists and professional scientists alike capture excessively high
levels of air pollutants every day. Yet, state leaders draw public attention
away from the localized environmental issues at hand with flashy new technology
that many doubt to be an effective remedy for climate change, nor a safe,
long-term solution for our state.

As emissions
reductions targets draw ever near, both policy and technological solutions will
continue to emerge. Yet, a just transition to clean energy means advancing
climate solutions that work for everyone, without introducing or maintaining
sources of environmental degradation. For state and local leaders, this means centering the voices of BIPOC and other historically marginalized groups in the decision-making processes. It's time to follow the lead of the locals, asking community members what they would like to see for the future of their home.
