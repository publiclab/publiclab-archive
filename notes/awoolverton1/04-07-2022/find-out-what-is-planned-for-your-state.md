In Louisiana's River
Parishes, petrochemical industries and infrastructure are [transforming](https://www.propublica.org/article/welcome-to-cancer-alley-where-toxic-air-is-about-to-get-worse "https://www.propublica.org/article/welcome-to-cancer-alley-where-toxic-air-is-about-to-get-worse") both the
economic and environmental landscape. As the state continues to attract
petrochemical and manufacturing companies through incentives such as the
Industrial Tax Exemption Program ([ITEP](https://www.opportunitylouisiana.com/business-incentives/industrial-tax-exemption)), those concerned about the impacts of
industrial pollution to nearby communities can stay informed about potential
new projects through a variety of databases. In St. James Parish, community members who have spent years staving off the proposed Formosa Plastics facility, are also keeping a
weather eye out for new proposed developments.

To help with this,
our Public Lab team reached out to colleague Gianna St. Julian, with the
Tulane Environmental Law Clinic. She pointed us to a wonderful list of
resources put together by the clinic. Thanks, Gianna!

Check out this extensive list of resources and websites that track cirtical health and environmental data across the country: 

[https://law.tulane.edu/sites/law.tulane.edu/files/Files/TELC%20ERLI%20Out%20of%20state%20Resources.pdf](https://law.tulane.edu/sites/law.tulane.edu/files/Files/TELC%20ERLI%20Out%20of%20state%20Resources.pdf "https://law.tulane.edu/sites/law.tulane.edu/files/Files/TELC%20ERLI%20Out%20of%20state%20Resources.pdf")

She has also pointed
us to some local resources, for Louisiana residents looking to track potential
industrial projects:

First, the [Louisiana
Public Notices](https://louisianapublicnotice.com/) page,
finds and sends you public notices containing and key words and locations that
are entered into the search feature. Additionally, the [Fastlane Public Reports](https://fastlaneng.louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com/public/reports "https://fastlaneng.louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com/public/reports") database, by
Louisiana Economic Development (LED), keeps track of tax exemption
applications, under different tax exemption programs, such as ITEP. Last, [LED News
Releases](https://www.opportunitylouisiana.com/led-news/news-releases) provides notifications on local projects before they even apply
for state permits or are announced.

Also in Louisiana,
once a permit has been applied for, through Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality here [Permit Applications Received](https://www.deq.louisiana.gov/resources/category/permit-applications-received "https://www.deq.louisiana.gov/resources/category/permit-applications-received"), often before
public notices are released. The database can provide you a list of all permits
within a given data range and for a specific media (air, water or soil). Users
can do an even more in-depth search through the [permit applications in EDMS](https://edms.deq.louisiana.gov/edmsv2/advanced-search) page.

We hope these
resources are helpful to your understanding of what might projects and
developments are being planned in and near your community!
