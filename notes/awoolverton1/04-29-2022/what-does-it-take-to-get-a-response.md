In
Louisiana, the burden of regulating our air and water quality repeatedly falls
to the citizens. The Game Over Formosa
team has been working to capture the impact of air pollution on community
members by matching ambient air quality data to first-hand reports from people
on the ground. 

Yet,
even when data is collected and reported alongside accounts of rancid odors,
garnering a meaningful response from the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality (LDEQ) remains difficult. 

A
recent [auditor's
report](http://app.lla.state.la.us/PublicReports.nsf/0/4F3372ABDDF0F271862586630067C25D/$FILE/00022660A.pdf?OpenElement&.7773098) "found that the time it took for the LDEQ to issue enforcement
actions after a known violation more than doubled between fiscal year 2015 and
2019, from nearly 10 months to nearly 20 months," according to a [recent piece](https://www.propublica.org/article/deq-louisiana-pollution)
by ProPublica. 

To
respond to complaints of odors from pollution, DEQ will need perhaps 1,000
reports. Filing this many complaints is a heavy lift in rural areas. And, in
"Cancer Alley," each parish contains dozens of plants. To complicate
matters further, residents may not even be able to identify which plant is
causing the odor. 

In
highly populated urban areas, residents have a leg up. Thousands of citizens
may be impacted by any one industrial site that is emitting pollution or
seeking a permit. Thus, it is easier for community leaders to generate the
volume of comments and calls necessary for a response from DEQ. For example, in
the nearby city of New Orleans, residents of the Irish Channel neighborhood
quickly filed thousands of complaints of odors emitted from Blackwater
Terminals facility, right across the river. And DEQ responded, with a lengthy [investigation](https://deq.louisiana.gov/assets/docs/News_Releases/2021/LDEQissuesreportonodorsinIrishChannelsectionofNewOrleans.pdf). 

Yet,
in the rural river parishes outside of the city, odors are routine and
complaints are further between. Far fewer residents and far more
plants mean that those who do complain quickly become burnt out. 

Advocates
can help lift the burden, by understanding the realities of rural citizens, and
helping those who live near plants to understand complaint procedures. 

For
example, our colleague at the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic notes that,
although many residents of St. James Parish do not have internet access, a
phone call is still a good and effective option for filing a complaint. For
those who do have internet, advocates can print yard signs or flyers with QR
codes that link to the LDEQ [complaint
website](https://internet.deq.louisiana.gov/portal/ONLINESERVICES/FORMS/FILE-A-CITIZEN-COMPLAINT). Other advocates have
supported those Cancer Alley by offering to make phone calls and file
complaints on their behalf. 

The
Greater New Orleans Interfaith Climate Coalition suggests [taking complaints straight to the
EPA](https://gnoicc.org/2021/11/07/2703/), should local-level authorities fail to respond. 

To
file a complaint, residents should include the name of the plant, and the AI
number if possible, so that LDEQ has
more authority to investigate and even enter the facility.

That's
why, in the coming months, we will be collaborating with our colleagues at
EarthJustice to create a Reporting Guide. The guide will include a list the
names, AI numbers, and exact locations, of every plant in St. James parish, to
help residents identify which plant may be causing a particular odor and
provide as much information as possible to DEQ.
It will use insights from the Louisiana Environmental Action Network's [Citizen's Guide](https://leanweb.org/citizens-guide) and Tulane
Environmental Law Clinic's [Citizen's Guide](http://www2.tulane.edu/~telc/html/CG_Vids.html) to streamline explanations of different
reporting mechanisms. 

We
look forward to sharing our work!
