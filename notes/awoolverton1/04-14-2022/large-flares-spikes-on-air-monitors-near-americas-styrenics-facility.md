Last Wednesday, April 6th, our Purple Air monitors showed
large spikes in concentrations. That same day, residents of St. James parish confirmed,
reporting a strong, foul odor wafting from the American Styrenics facility.
Community leader Sharon Lavigne, and others, noticed a large flare from the
facility's stack.

As black plumes and sharp smells continued, monitor readings climbed
through the early morning hours and peeked at 10am. The following day, monitors
stayed above 30/CM for roughly 18 hours. Anything above 12/CM is considered very
high. Air monitors show orange all the way to the town of Wallace, roughly 20
miles away, due to high wings.

Yet, this is nothing new: for decades, the residents of St. James and
the surrounding parishes have been able to smell the toxins released from
flares nearly every day. While complaints from locals should trigger a response
from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), the agency does
not, in fact, respond very frequently to notices of concern. To make matters
worse, local scientists have observed that, on average, most pollution happen
between 2 and 5am, when residents are asleep and less likely to notice -- and
report --strong odors. In rural areas, it is even more unlikely that there will
be a sufficient number of comments to garner the agency's response.

How can we get LDEQ to take our concerns for our community's
health seriously?

Between air monitoring and documenting first-hand observations, our
goal is to capture how these spikes impact the community. Going forward, we plan
to keep notes about what the wind speed and direction was at that point in time
to corroborate the increase in concentrations. We hope to match concentrations
on our Purple Air monitors to reports of large smoke plumes as well as strong odors
from folks on the ground.

As our Purple Air monitors continue to capture spike in pollution,
the Game Over Formosa team will be capturing and synthesizing this data, along
with on-the-ground photos and anecdotes. In addition to reporting all of this
to LDEQ, we will log and share it all here, on Public Lab. Finally, and
crucially, we will share this information with the St. James community, through
the grassroots organization RISE St. James. It is always important that those
living closest to the facilities are aware of what is going on as often as possible.
Stay tuned!
