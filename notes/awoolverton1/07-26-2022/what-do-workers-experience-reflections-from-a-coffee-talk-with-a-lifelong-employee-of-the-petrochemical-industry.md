The science on the
petrochemical industry is clear. It pollutes the air with carcinogens like [benzene](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-09/documents/benzene.pdf)
and [ethylene
oxide](https://www.epa.gov/hazardous-air-pollutants-ethylene-oxide/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental), it contaminates the soil and [water](https://www.businessinsider.com/louisiana-cancer-alley-photos-oil-refineries-chemicals-pollution-2019-11#it-is-killing-people-by-over-polluting-them-with-toxins-in-their-water-and-in-their-air-he-said-this-is-slavery-of-another-kind-15),
and its detrimental to human health. In South Louisiana's 80-mile petrochemical corridor, also known as "[Cancer
Alley](https://www.propublica.org/article/welcome-to-cancer-alley-where-toxic-air-is-about-to-get-worse)," residents living among 150 facilities face
far higher-than-average [cancer
rates](https://www.lsuhsc.edu/newsroom/LSU%20Health%20New%20Orleans%20LA%20Tumor%20Registry%20Releases%204th%20Census%20Tract%20Cancer%20Incidence%20Report.html "https://www.lsuhsc.edu/newsroom/LSU%20Health%20New%20Orleans%20LA%20Tumor%20Registry%20Releases%204th%20Census%20Tract%20Cancer%20Incidence%20Report.html"). These facilites also contribute to leaked [methane](https://www.iea.org/reports/driving-down-methane-leaks-from-the-oil-and-gas-industry)
and other greenhouse gasses emissions that drive climate change.

Yet, industry brings
jobs. The Louisiana Chemical Association touts a time when the industry's
employment peaked at over [34,000
employees](http://www.lca.org/aws/LCA/pt/sp/LCA_why "http://www.lca.org/aws/LCA/pt/sp/LCA_why"). Formosa Group, a Taiwanese-based plastics facility [awaiting
permits](https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/08/19/army-corps-orders-environmental-review-of-proposed-formosa-plastics-plant-in-louisianas-cancer-alley/) for a 12-plant complex in St. James Parish, promises [1,200
permanent jobs](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/plastics-plants-are-poised-to-be-the-next-big-carbon-superpolluters/ "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/plastics-plants-are-poised-to-be-the-next-big-carbon-superpolluters/") and another 8,000 temporary jobs during construction.

But jobs don't
always equal livelihoods, and employment doesn't always indicate prosperity.
That's why the Public Lab [Game-Over-Formosa](https://publiclab.org/wiki/game-over-formosa-plastics)
Team sat down with a lifelong employee of the petrochemical industry to learn
more about the day-to-day experiences of the industrial workers.

Mr.
"Andrew" (who asked to remain anonymous) told us of his decades working
in the region. He's employed by a trucking company which is contracted out by
several different plants in the area, including Shell Oil.

Mr. Andrew described
to us in vivid detail a particular incident in 2001, that exposed him and his
coworkers to a slew of dangerous chemicals. "The chemicals inundated my
system," he recalls, "the eyes, the nose, and the mouth." Inefficiencies
at the plant prevented them from reaching the safety shower for an hour and a
half, in clear violation of worker-safety laws, he says.

In the two decades
since the incident, Mr. Andrew filed a lawsuit, and received legal retribution.
And, his story has been promulgated as a warning by local activist groups.
Nothing that severe that ever happened again, he says.

Nonetheless, he and
other workers experience toxic exposures on a regular basis. Just last year, he
told us, the substances that was transporting around a plant gave him "headaches
and stuff. That stuff was so strong you had to cut off your air
condition."

"I started
getting headaches and stomach aches, when I would pass by the fertilizer
plant" he continued. "But when I worked there regularly, (the
symptoms) stopped, because my body got used to it."

We asked Mr. Andrew
how his friends and neighbors perceive the environmental health consequences of
heavy industry. He says that people in his community are getting sick, and when
they do, pregnant women are losing their babies. "That's just a known
fact. I don't know their names, but I talked to their husbands and boyfriends.
(They tell me about) miscarriages and all that."

And recently, he
says, folks have begun to link the onslaught of adverse health impacts to the
slew of refineries and petrochemical facilities in their backyards. "They
didn't used to know it was the chemical plant," he said, "But it's obvious, now. Everybody knows."

Yet, Mr. Andrew's
family, friends, and coworkers seldom file complaints with the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality or the EPA, if ever. "That's because
nobody has the knowledge of how to do it," he says.

This comment, and
other conversations with locals, inspired the publication of an [Incident Reporting Guide](https://www.risestjames.org/incidentreport "https://www.risestjames.org/incidentreport"),
authored by members of this team, with the help of advocacy groups EarthJustice
and RISE St. James.

At Public Lab, we
learned a lot from our conversation with Mr. Andrew. We gained insight into the
real health incidents of an industry that does not always - or often - have the
best interest of its employees at heart. We learned about community perceptions
of the industry, as well as levels of local knowledge regarding how to report
incidents.

If community-science
is to inform advocacy, it must also be informed by the real experiences of
community members themselves. The
Game-Over-Formosa team encourages other Public Lab teams to listen and learn by
setting up conversations with distinct members of the communities they work in.
