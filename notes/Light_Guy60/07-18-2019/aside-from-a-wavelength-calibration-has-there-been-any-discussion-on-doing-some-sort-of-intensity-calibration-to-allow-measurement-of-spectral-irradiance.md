Knowing that, calculation of other attributes such as color and correlated color temperature is easy. As for a calibration source, one could use published data for solar spectral irradiance for a given terrestrial area. Food for thought. BTW: in ballpark figures, what is the cost of construction using the parts you have on-hand? Excellent project!
