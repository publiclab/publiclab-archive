I took photo with my smartphone, upload with smartphone and PC, checked and unchecked the checkbox of vertical, rotated the device for 90 degree on my smartphone, zoomed in/out, rename the file, and all the methods lead to the same result: vertical spectrum. Am I doing anything wrong?

  
smartphone: Zenphone 3

browser: Chrome

recapture with 90 degree rotation of the device
