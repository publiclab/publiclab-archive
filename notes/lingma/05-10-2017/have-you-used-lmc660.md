Hello~all. Thanks for taking time to read my post.  
Questions:
I want to make a voltage follower by using LMC660. I have never use this kind. Could you give me some advice?
Background:
As LMC660 (link removed by admin) data-sheet shows, it’s ideal for operation from a single supply. It operates from  +5V to +15.5V and features rail to rail output seing in addition to an input common-mode range that includes ground. Performance limitations that have plagued CMOS amplifiers in the past are not a problem with this design,
Well,my voltage follower’s setting index: input=0-5V, while output=0-5V and drive an optical coupler--TLP521.  The voltage of amplifier power supply: +5V, GND.

Could you give me some suggestions?Thanks a lot.
