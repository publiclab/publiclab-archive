##What I want to do
Tomorrow is the test of my newly made 4' sled kite and video camera rig.  First I'll have to stabilize the kite by making a tail then I'll see if it is strong enough to lift the 1# rig.  

The location is on the shore of lake michigan so there should be a decent breeze.  

The goal is to determine the requirements for stable video and change the rigging system accordingly.  I expect pretty shaky video the first time around.  

I think the main limitation this setup has right now is weight; the camera is relatively heavy.  It may make up for that in duration of recording, but we'll find that out soon.

0.7 mil plastic sheeting and 3/16" dowels, strung up with 30# test nylon line for now.
