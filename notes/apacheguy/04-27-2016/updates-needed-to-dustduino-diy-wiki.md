The wiki references an obsolete Arduino Proto Wireless Shield from Mouser that can no longer be purchased. Please update the wiki to suggest a working alternative solution.

The Arduino Uno + shield + wifi antenna is quite costly. Why not replace with a more robust and affordable Raspberry Pi 3? I assume that that one would still be able to connect the Groove sensor to the Pi 3 RX pins and read the output, no?
