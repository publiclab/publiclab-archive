This is a general overview and summary of Greening Deserts economical, educational, cultural, social, scientific and sustainable projects. You can use the details and experiences.  

  
The
_[**Greening
Deserts**](http://greeningdeserts.com/)__[**Trillion
Trees Initiative**](http://trilliontreesinitiative.org/)_
and _[**Greening
Camps**](http://www.greeningcamp.com/)_
can reduce negative climate changes, deforestation, droughts,
desertification, land degradation, floods and global warming on a
large scale - especially in human-made deserts, drylands, savanna and
wastelands. Inviting nations, organisations, personalities and
institutions since years and many have shown interest. You are also
welcome to join the projects and greening initiative. Let's make the
world green again, together! Let's plant billions or even a trillion
trees to improve the climate and to reduce global warming
significantely, especially with urban greening camps in urban areas.
It is maybe the cheapest and most effective solution to cool down
planet Earth, clean up the air and waters. Greening Deserts founder
developed good solutions and projects to regreen drylands and
wastelands with different kinds of resistant and typical plants. The
greening and research camps will be green spots to cultivate all the
plants and trees are needed, for example ground cover, flower trees,
wild grasses, wild flowers and medicinal plants. Together with soil
improving plants top soil layers will be created in just a few years
- the basis for the following tree plantations and mixed forests.
Seeds and seed balls can be dropped by seeding balloons and seeding
drones. 

  
Greening Deserts economical,
educational, cultural, social, scientific and sustainable projects
have really big potential to reduce desertification and global
warming, to improve healthy environments, sustainable agriculture
(**EcoFarming**)
and ecological forestry (**EcoForestry**).
It are also projects for innovative **Cleantech**
and **Greentech**
developments. Here are some of the main projects: **like
**_[**Agrophotovoltaik**](http://agrovoltaik.com/)_**,
**_[**Desert
Bamboo Africa**](http://desertbamboo.com/)_**,
**_[**Greening
Coasts**](http://greeningcoasts.com/)_**,
**_[**Greening
Drones**](http://greeningdrones.com/)_**,
**_[**Greenhouse
Ship**](http://greenhouseship.com/)_**,
**_[**Green
Ring Africa**](http://greenringafrica.com/)_**,
**_[**Great
Green Wall North Africa**](http://greatgreenwall.net/)_**,
**_[**Seeding
Balloon**](http://seedingballoon.com/)_**and **_[**Transparent
Solar**](http://transparentsolar.org/)_**Greenhouses**. All
these projects were founded and initiated by **Oliver
Gediminas Caplikas** during
the last years. Strong future partners and investors for the ongoing
project developments are always welcome! Invest in true values like
education, ecological or real sustainable products and services
together with our upcoming education, greening and research camps.
Your investment in Greening Deserts projects will really change the
world and we will create a better history or future. Global
Cooling with Global Greening is not just possible, it is very
realistic and the most effective solution -- especially in relation
to the costs, energy and time. Another important points are
environmental education, climate adaption, mitigation, resilience and
sustainability. All these points and developments will be realised at
the forestation, greening and research camps.

Building a basic camp with a
little team needs approx three to nine months, depends on the
conditions and region. Greening and forestation of each concerned
region starts from the very beginning, so like planting trees for the
first parks. Bigger camps can get an _[**Energy
Storage Park**](http://energystoragepark.com/)_
with a solar
park, water park****and
or wind park. Smaller
camps will have of course solar energy and water supply, too. There
are many developments and other projects connected, most of them will
be realised with the camps. It is also interesting for urban areas,
city forests and gardens - especially community and rooftop gardens.
Many ambassadors, ministers, trade commissioners, scientists and
experts were invited to join Greening Deserts campaigns, initiatives
and projects during the years. We exchanged a lot about the
sustainable developments, technics and techniques could be developed
at the new [**Greening
Camps**](http://www.greeningcamp.com/).
You can read more
about on the official and social pages. 

Many scientists confirming
Greening Deserts concepts and projects, for example to plant a
trillion trees to reduce human-made climate change effects and global
warming worldwide. With financial support the projects like the
Greening and Research Camps could finally start with forestation and
greening, especially of drylands or wastelands in Africa and Europe.
The Greening Camp project development is running since 2018, after
successful funding in 2019 or 2020 the project can start fast as
possible and build the first pilot camps.   

**More important information
about Greening Deserts special projects like the new Critically
Endangered Species (**_[**CES-RPP**](http://www.greeningdeserts.com/projects/critically-endangered-species-research-and-protection-program/)_**)
research and protection program.**

It's about Greening Camps,
innovative developments, research, global goals and effective
solutions. Greening Deserts projects like the greening and research
camps will be platforms for Cleantech, climate protection, nature
conservation, culture, education, environmental and species
protection, Greentech and science. All camps can have a library,
lounge and media room. Perfect to exchange with education, book and
media branch, to experiment with creative designs, green building and
sustainable architecture. Bigger camps can get an Energy Storage Park
and even could be expanded to a kind of campus or science park. 

We have not much time to
establish hundreds of camps, greenhouses and new special areas, on
land and at sea, for the most endangered species and keystone species
of this world. It is similar as with other cascade effects like the
permafrost and wetlands problem. If more keystone species like the
bees extinct, even relative unknown or small ones, it will accelerate
the mass extinction and reach 'tipping points' in relation to the
critical biodiversity loss is ongoing. The only way is to focus on
this most important issue of the world and put it on the first place
of all agendas, concentrate on the most endangered known species and
find the forgotten and unknown keystone species with best of search
algorithms, networks and intelligent systems like AI, Deep Learning,
cloud and crowdworking, archive management and intelligent library
systems - powered by best of computing environments, so like special
supercomputers. It has really more priority as using so much
computing resources for astrological calculations, brain simulations
or other mega applications which doing all the same or nearly simliar
kind of tasks or work. Not to mention all the energy wasting
computers, servers and smartphones in idle mode or used for time
wasting tasks like certain films, series or war games.

It is important for us all to
prevent the mass extinction in the next years, to restore and improve
biodiversity in so many areas, also in urban areas. We all need to
care more the species who are endangered or treatended the most! It
makes no sense if there are so many conservation and species
protection initiatives or programs for a single species like
elephants, pandas,.. in background much more important species dying
out. The species protection community and organisations like IUCN Red
List of Threatened Species should overwork their agenda and
priorities in this relation. Humanity must protect more the keystone
species, particularly on which many other life forms depend on! For
example if the most important species bees extinct, humans will
extinct some years later. Another point is to support the climate
adaption of animals and plants on the long term, help the species to
survive by providing extra wildlife habitats like more biotopes, game
reserves, meadows, parks and diverse forests for more biodiversity.

Every day counts to protect the
most endangered species with all means and to bring this aspect, this
task and the topic to the top on all relevant agendas - on all
possible channels, daily and internationally. Of course,
corresponding protected areas with the highest concentrations of life
forms in all possible regions and climate zones also have priority.
The 'overprotected' species and programs, resources, energies, .. in
this context.. they should also concentrate more on these aspects,
because to protect so much elephants, polar bears, giraffes, pandas,
etc. who are relative save and every day important key species dying
out ! It is a similar problem as with the neglected tipping points
and the wrong prioritization of politics and economy - see United
Nations Climate Change Conference. Only if the problems mentioned are
resolved promptly the cascade effects can be reduced and possibly
over decades of massive efforts stopped, and new disasters in this
regard prevented. Then there may be a real chance to prevent
extinction, also of humanity. Every action and every person counts in
this regard, whether large or small, known or unknown. We maybe have
approx two years to solve these problems and ten years to plant a
trillion trees worldwide. 

Bees have been declared as the
most important species on planet earth. However, according to
wildlife experts and scientists, the bees have joined the endangered
species long list. Insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and other
pesticides must be reduced, so like the air pollution. Let's plant
more wild flowers and flower trees, especially for the bees, birds
and other animals who need trees to survive. We need more biotopes,
real natural and wild habitats or wildlife reserves with wild
meadows, mixed forests and protected areas like game reserves,
landscape conservation, nature conservation and water conservation
areas. Greening Deserts projects goals are mainly to restore natural
landscapes like mixed forests, grasslands and wetlands - to bring
back biodiversity, clean air, topsoils and water. Reduce and stop
deforestation in near future, replace wood with other sustainable
materials like hemp and rice straw.

  
**Further information and news:**

The Greening Camp plants like
desert bamboo and hemp will improve the soils, underground water and
waters in general. Drylands and wastelands can be turned into fertile
lands easily with Greening Deserts technics and technologies were
developed during the last three years. It improves the soils in just
a few years, after this other soil improving plants, environmental
friendly crops and trees can be planted. There will be many side
products of the forestation or greening processes, it can be
delivered to hemp product producers like the paper branch and
packaging industry. All would win at the end - the poor people or
regions, the degraded lands or soils, the forestry, paper and wood
industry - even big wood paper consumers like the book, newspaper and
packaging industry. Hemp and rice straw paper books could reform the
book and paper branch in many ways. If you want to know more about,
don't hesitate to contact. We are experts in these fields and markets
since 2003\. The worldwide cleaning and greening process can
accelerate the global peace building process siginificantly.

And again! You and colleagues are
welcome to join the **Greening
Deserts** campaigns and
initiatives like the official **Trillion
Trees Initiative** to
reduce negative climate changes, deforestation, droughts,
desertification, land degradation, floods and global warming on a
large scale - especially in human-made deserts, drylands and
wastelands. The initiative was founded in 2018\. 

The founder launched another
great initivative to reduce plastic waste in worldwide waters and it
will open a complete new sustainable market. It's called Plastic
Fishery, more news will come on the plastic fisher network and
platform.

Awareness programmes,
communications letters and statements were initiated and shared with
thousands of worldwide governments, institutions and organisations in
summer, autumn and winter 2019\. Diverse collaborations, cooperations,
partnerships and sponsorships are possible. Feel free to contact by
the official channels and pages on **Greening
Deserts** and _[**Trillion
Trees**](http://trilliontrees.net/)_**Network.**

Climate protection, nature
conservation and environmental protection is also species protection.
Please do not ignore and forward if you can, it affects us all.
Childrens Rights are Human Rights. Clean air, soils, waters and
healthy environments are Human Rights, too. We need more
environmental awareness and sustainability, sustainable living and
sustainable working, in all fields or areas. We need to create a
world of understanding, acceptance, respect, tolerance, compassion
and consciousness. 

Do
more for green places in your city, try to establish more community
gardens, city parks, city forests, urban farming areas, fascade and
rooftop gardens. Show that you can live and work really sustainable
by saving energy, water and other natural resources. Reduce waste and
pollution, especially plastic waste. Use alternative packaging and
ecological products like bamboo or similar products.-

Constructive feedback and real
support is welcome. We humanity and planet Earth really need, more
than ever before.
