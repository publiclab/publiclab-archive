To join the IRC through a desktop client, you can follow the following example:
I have used [XChat](http://xchat.org/) for Ubuntu in this example but the process should be similar for other clients too.

1) After installing the client, choose a nick and other name choices which will be displayed when you post chat messages.
2) Choose **OFTC** as the network. PublicLab channel is hosted on [OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/) network.

3) Under _Join this channel_ enter: **#publiclab**

The next screen should be the publiclab live IRC.
