The following features for the Leaflet based Edit page are complete:
1) Dragging

2) Rotation

3) Scaling

Limitations:

1) All these features do not work together as of now. Rotation and Scaling work together. Distortions works separately, so does Dragging. Transparency and outline work with every case. I have kept 3 separate urls to test each functionality individually.

2) The map zoom handler and map dragging handler do not work smoothly with all the functions. I have simply enabled dragging and zooming which occurs through Leaflet, they need to be customized specifically for distorted images.

3) The functions have been tested to work on Firefox + Chrome for desktop and Chrome for Android only. Bugs might appear on other browsers. 

Things to do in the remaining days:

1) Add documentation for the code.
2) Merge the branch with mapknitter master branch.
