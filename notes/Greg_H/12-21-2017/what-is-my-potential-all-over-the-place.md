I have a problem with the WheeStat that I bought. The potential that is 
read by the software is very different from the one that I apply. Do you have an idea of what I am doing wrong?  
Does it have to do with which power source is being selected? Debug or 
Device? On the website picture, it shows that the microcontroller is powered up 
via the debug. Is this correct?
