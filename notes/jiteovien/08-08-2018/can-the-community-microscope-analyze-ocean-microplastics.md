@maxliboiron recently made a great post about using BabyLegs- a research trawl (net system) for monitoring plastic pollution, especially microplastics, in surface water. You can reference [this page](https://publiclab.org/wiki/micro) to learn how to build and deploy the BabyLegs trawl and how to process your samples. In the wiki page about [microplastics analysis](https://publiclab.org/notes/maxliboiron/07-19-2018/how-to-analyze-plastics-forensically), she mentions the need for a dissecting microscope, which is different than a compound microscope. 

  
Public Lab is curious if the [community microscope](https://publiclab.org/wiki/micro), which is a compound microscope in its present state, can be converted into a dissecting microscope for this use. I've made a diagram below, illustrating what I believe to be the conversion process. I haven't tried it out myself but I encourage others to do so and let us know how it goes!
