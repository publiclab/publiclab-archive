I built the coqui a few days ago - cool project! In the past, I've done a lot of STEM outreach work and think it would be a great project for a workshop for middle or high school students.

Some comments I had while building:

- I primarily referenced [this](https://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/09-30-2014/coqui-bbv1-0) page for instructions on the build but I also looked through more of the posts where coqui is tagged. In terms of information accessibility, I think it would be helpful for people who may not have a science background for the instructions to include some more description on the different variables that we are sensing with the Coqui. I.e. why is conductivity an important measure for water quality? Why would ambient light be a useful variable? I also see that folks have done some awesome work on visualizing and logging the frequency output from the coqui. To take it one step further in terms of data interpretability, I think it would also be cool to have more readily available information on what the various frequencies may physically represent. For example, what are EPA acceptable levels of conductivity when assessing water quality. Some info answering my above questions can be found [here](https://archive.epa.gov/water/archive/web/html/vms59.html). I learned that sewage traces in would likely raise the conductivity level of water while an oil spill would lower the conductivity level. Having that knowledge as a reference point was very important for me to be able to gain more meaning from the frequencies I was hearing.
