I've just build the tool from the kit that I've ordered.

1. How to choose the rear camera on Galaxy S7 (Chrome browser)

2. Why the image is so small, I did not find a way to enhance it, or it was unintuitive.

3. The capture did start to work for a second, but then it did refuse to work anymore, probably I'd have to close the browser, I'll try later.

4. Note - the tape or the box is conductive :/ my screen was constantly interrupted, I had to use small post it - so annoying - why did you even thought of using front camera.... ?

5. I did try to point the spectrometer at the LED light, and the Ikea Vaxer light - so much noise on the screen... Why? Is the gap to wide (I did use sharp knife as gap-meter - suppose it is 0.3-0.5mm wide....)

Any thoughts?
I'm kind of upset now - it supposed to work, but it seems like an alpha version...
I know it is an open project, and I'd love it, but so many things failed to work in a row...
It reminds me a linux 10 years ago - so buggy or intuitive...

How could I help you to debug this issue?
