# Replicating IBM's Lensless, Holographic, RPi Microscope?

![Taken from conference paper][1]

Hi all, 

I was scouring through papers for my spectrometer, when I ran into [this conference paper][2] from IBM where they make a holographic microscope capable of resolving plankton and reconstructing the image using some python software. I found [this question][3] on the forums here, but the thread goes cold. 

Seeing as how this microscope has an almost identical BOM with my spectrometer (mainly a lensless picamera, and a lensless laser pointer, both of which I have lying around) how easy would this be to replicate (albeit without the AI part)? Could this have potential as open hardware for water sampling? IBM doesn't seem to have much documentation other than the conference paper, if anyone has any more information or ideas, sharing them would be much appreciated.
