UNH's PicturePost & the Seacoast Science Center are interested in using Infragram to expand on usage of the [Seacoast Science Center (SSC) PicturePost](http://picturepost.unh.edu/post.jsp?postId=1).  

##What I want to do
UNH's Student Climate Data: [Vegetation Index Learning Sequence](http://studentclimatedata.unh.edu/vegetationsequence.shtml#) provides a great resource for analyzing digital images.  The sequence looks at [NDVI changing through the seasons](http://studentclimatedata.unh.edu/animation/ndvi.html)," which exhibits the average MODIS NDVI in the N & S hemispheres. 
![MODIS_PicPost.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/000/921/medium/MODIS_PicPost.png)

Part 3: [Linking PicturePost images to MODIS data](http://studentclimatedata.unh.edu/vegetationsequence_part3.shtml) is the particular area of interest & asks: "How do Picture Post images compare to corresponding MODIS images, and what potential variables might affect the correlation between these two data sources?"

Infragram images can be used to expand on the sequence above & to compare seasonal NDVI.

##My attempt and results
I took some Infragram pics & uploaded them to the [SSC PicturePost](http://picturepost.unh.edu/post.jsp?postId=1).  The images can be downloaded by anyone & converted to NGB & NDVI through [PVOS Infrapix converter](http://infrapix.pvos.org/).

I need to work on using a balance card before taking pics. 

##Questions and next steps
Improve the workflow: Balance card calibrations, Capture, Upload raw (or Convert, Upload to PicPost)
Speak with Annette Schloss, UNH Picture Post, & Rob Royer, Seacoast Science Center, about how they would like to use Infragram.   
Mention my interest in collecting NGB imagery of the SSC & Odiorne Point State Park at [low tide](http://publiclab.org/notes/wward1400/06-14-2013/infragram-tidepooling).

From what I understand, obtaining accurate NDVI images through Infragram is presently being run through final testing.  Some people may already be comparing their images to MODIS NDVI, but it benefits the community to be repeated: Collecting visible imagery & NIR for comparison to MODIS NDVI could provide another estimate for Infragram NDVI.  

Learn from other monitoring programs, like [PhenoCam](http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/about/), & see how Infragram could be used to build more data collection points as a low cost entry for citizen scientists.
