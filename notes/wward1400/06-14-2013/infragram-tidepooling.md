Tidepooling is a good way to get outside & go explore a new area more in depth.  I went out to Seacoast Science Center & Odiorne Park in Rye, NH, to see what I could capture with the Infragram camera.  

##What I want to do
I wanted to get outside & see what I could find along the shore.  I tried out the Infragram camera to see what would show up.

##My attempt and results
I took pics along the coast of New Hampshire & Maine around low tide.  Now, I have a strong visual image that shows what plants can be found at low tide.  

The above pics were from Seacoast Science Center & Odiorne State Park at Rye, NH.  I found the contrast striking & am excited to see what results I'll get from balloon mapping similar areas.

##Questions and next steps
The next step is to process the raw images into NDVI--just wanted to get more eyes on this. 

What are some ways I could track changes in these seaweed beds? 
How could I track whether the seaweed & seagrasses are covering more area or moving closer to the shore?  

Could this be used in Oyster Restoration projects? 

In the future, I could send up the Infragram camera on a balloon or kite to gather aerial imagery of the coast at low tide.  The images could be added to [Mapknitter](https://mapknitter.org/) to make a map displaying plant health.
