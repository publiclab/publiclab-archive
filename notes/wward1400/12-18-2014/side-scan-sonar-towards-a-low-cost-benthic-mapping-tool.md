I originally learned of using side scan sonar/side imaging/fish sonar from a kayak fisherman tinkering around with a Side Scan Sonar/fish sonar device.

I found more academic literature as I dived deeper:<ul>
[Assessment of Deadhead Logs and large Woody Debris using Side Scan Sonar and Field Surveys](http://www.georgiawildlife.com/sites/default/files/uploads/wildlife/nongame/images/GeorgiaWildenews/Fisheries_December_2010.pdf) in American Fisheries Society <br>
[A Novel Approach to Surveying Sturgeon Using Side-Scan Sonar and Occupancy Modeling](http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1080/19425120.2013.816396) in Marine and Coastal Fisheries: Dynamics, Management, and Ecosystem Science</ul>

###What I want to do
Information on benthic substrate is often gathered through methods with fast spatiotemporal decay.  One might sample by transect in the summer, then floods & hurricanes change the nature of substrate by winter.  

I want to explore using a Side Scan Sonar to map changing substrates over time to track changes in land use/real estate development patterns upstream or possibly find some relationship between dam removal and sediment transport downstream. 

I would like to eventually make a lower cost tool.  And given that one of my initial sources has already done some [tinkering around with side imaging](http://dizzybigfish.co.uk/kayak-mods-pimp-my-yak/side-imaging-sonar-on-a-kayak/), this may be more than a moonshot.

###Why I'm interested
Mapping information tends to stop at a body of water.

Gathering information and data on what is under the water requires high cost or high time costs to gather transects and extrapolate.  High resolution data like topobathy & [bathymetric lidar](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/lidar/l2_p6.html) is obtained through expensive, time consuming methods--large flight planning crews, flight crews, airplanes, etc.

The work by Kaeser & Litts has been presented & workshopped numerous times since 2010 featuring the need for a [remote sensing technique needed for riverscape research in stream systems](http://forums.sideimagingsoft.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=947.0;attach=2087).

One current project using Side Scan Sonar for substrate mapping is the [Chipola River Applied Habitat Benthic Mapping Project](http://www.southeastaquatics.net/projects/habitat-projects-2013/chipola-river-applied-habitat-mapping-project) in northwest Florida led by [Southeast Aquatics Resource Partnership](http://www.southeastaquatics.net/about/where-we-work).

The Chipola River Applied Habitat Mapping Project with investigators, Jennifer Bock and Beth Stys, was featured earlier in 2014 in the Fisheries & Information Technology section of the American Fisheries Society as well: [Landscape Level In-Stream Habitat Mapping Using Side Scan Sonar](http://www.fishdata.org/newsletters/spring-2014/landscape-level-stream-habitat-mapping-using-side-scan-sonar).

[![BenthicMapping_Layers.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/501/medium/BenthicMapping_Layers.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/501/original/BenthicMapping_Layers.png)

Low-cost benthic habitat mapping is highly important and cheaper than flying a lidar mission.  However,   devices for side scan sonar are still in the four-figure range ($2000+).  

###My attempt and results 
I am identifying needs and user scenarios for a lower cost side scan sonar.  

I will keep watching for an after market device, troubleshooting guide, or teardown review to make an inventory the components in the device.  From there, I can identify potential sellers of the components and see where I can view existing software or papers covering the software used to produce the images.

###Questions and next steps
1. Read through the [Sonar Imagery Geoprocessing Workbook](http://www.fws.gov/panamacity/resources/Sonar_Imagery_Geoprocessing_Workbook_v2_1.pdf).
2. Gather resources, equipment, information, code, etc.
3. Gather users & collaborators as there has been mention of a need for [repurposing fish sonar](http://publiclab.org/notes/maxliboiron/02-11-2014/underwater-plume-sampling-methods#c8241).
