Mapping repairs to the jetty and changes to the beach located near the Merrimack River entrance.  

Used a balloon kit to map from the boardwalk leading to the beach then walked southeast towards the jetty, used a beach trail to travel southwest to Reservation Terrace, watched out for powerlines along Reservation Terrace, & looped back towards the jetty on Plum Island.  

In the future, I'd like to track my path on the ground.  

Scroll north to get to the jetty & see changes in the beach:

Unsorted imagery of the jetty on the north section of Plum Island can be found at Mapmill from around <a href="http://mapmill.org/images/2013-03-13-massachusetts-plumisland">page 70-100</a>.
