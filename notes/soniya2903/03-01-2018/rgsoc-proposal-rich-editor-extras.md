## Project description

Rich Editor Extras require better user interfaces for various inline power tags. This will need Bootstrap, HTML UI work on the PublicLab. Also the project needs to be integrated with [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org). website backend.

### Problem:-

There is need of better User Interfaces, since if we have a look at the applications today, they have multiple features endorsed in it. Hence to compete with these many applications , there has to be awesome interface with as many as possible features. It avoids the inconvenience of the user as well who will use it. And also last but not least, for a good Editor the user interface with many features is the real key.
