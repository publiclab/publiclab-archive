## Project description

Public Labs UI Improvements

### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

Improve the UI/UX of [publiclab.org](http://publiclab.org) to make it more user friendly
and usable.

### Problem

The current [publiclab.org](http://publiclab.org) page has bugs and lot of scope for UI Improvements.

To list a few:-

- Certain pop up messages going outside screen
- Certain messages beginning with a capital letter while certain
do not , certain messages not clearly understandable
- Missing pop up messages for some buttons etc making it hard to
understand
- Navbar doesn't have a home page option for unregistered user,
Process of navigation is tedious and number of click counts of a user
is high in this case
- Alignment of certain elements on the page are ambiguous leaving
a lot of white space on certain parts whereas there is crowding on
others.
- Cluttered arrangement of text, buttons and images
- Lack of color consistency

UI improvements are all about improving user experience and
interaction with a website.

This project aims to achieve that.

### Implementation

This project will build on the Bootstrap 4 UI library to implement new HTML templates within the Ruby on
Rails website at [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org), focused on the following pages:

- Dashboard
- People's Page
- Tags/Topics page
- Individual Tags page
- Questions Page
- Profile Page

A detailed description of page wise problems, bugs and UI improvements follow

### 1) Dashboard

Currently the dashboard page looks like this

PROBLEMS

- Welcome message can be more prominent with a new line added.

More info in this issue [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/4977](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/4977)

- Change UI of subscribe button. It presently isn't very visible to a user.

Adding a blue color to this like the other buttons would help

- Dashboard is only a feature for a signed up user, so a user who has not registered cannot see it on the navbar

More info in this issue [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/5218](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/5218)

- The Topics section looks very cluttered in the present UI design
- The ask a question and wiki tabs can be aligned better
- The order of comments, questions, notes etc displayed on the dashboard for all users are the same in reverse chronological order
- It has to be personalized for each user since all of this may not be relevant to every user
- The dashboard must feature and focus more on the subscribed topics of each user and highlight those.

![image description](https://publiclab.org/i/30598.png "dashboard.png")\_\_

NEW DASHBOARD PAGE

- This dashboard is personalized for a user
- Shows location map of a user and updates regarding activity in that area and other users near by which are matters of concern to a particular user.
- Along with recommended and trending topics based on user history even updates on topics the user follows are displayed
- The recent activity of a user is also displayed to keep track of ones activity on a website. Like activity log of a user
- Clicking on topics on the trending and recommended section users can follow or subscribe to a topic

### 2) People's Page

Currently the People's page looks like this

PROBLEMS

- The Page has too much black space and needs to be better arranged
- It is irrelevant to display so many layer options on the map here
- The table display can be changed to a card display to stand out

![image description](/i/30652.png "peopleold.png")

NEW PEOPLE'S PAGE

- It had a centered map to show user locations
- Displays users in the form of card
- Also arranges the user according to recent activity
- On hover displays the comments and questions and posts by the user

### 3) Tags/Topics Page

Current Tags/Topics page

![image description](/i/30656.png "tagold.png")

More info on issue [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/5090](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/5090)

Changes to make

- Redesigning the search bar

NEW TAGS/TOPICS PAGE

### 

### 4) Individual Tags Page

Current Look

PROBLEMS

- The page looks cluttered and is not understandable to a new user
- No consistency in coloring of buttons.
- Subscribe button is not standing out on the page

- Card design can be used here for a clutter free neat arrangement

![image description](/i/30658.png "perold.png")

NEW TAG PAGE

![image description](/i/30659.png "pertag1.png")

![image description](/i/30660.png "pertag2.png")

### 5) Questions Page

Current Questions Page

PROBLEMS

![image description](/i/30690.png "ask2.png")

- The current UI is too cluttered and has too much information in one page
- Both asking questions and viewing other questions etc happen all on the same page which doesn't have much clarity
- 2 search bars on the same line doesn't look good and is too crowded
- Editor too can be centered and tooltips can be added to give instruction regarding all formatting options

![image description](/i/30692.png "ask1.png")

NEW QUESTIONS PAGE

- Adds more info regarding how to ask a question on clicking learn more
- Less cluttered and easily understandable UI
- Complexity in posting a question reduced with just a textarea to type out the question
- Also add featured questions and recent questions section to show a user the latest updates

![image description](/i/30691.png "ask.png")

### 6) Profile Page

Current profile page

PROBLEMS

- Profile page is the most important page for a user and needs to be appealing
- Its too cluttered and not spaced out evenly
- The present design offers too much content in one page

![image description](/i/30693.png "profile.png")

NEW PROFILE PAGE

- Shows all the relevant content in a neat manner
- Highlights the user profile picture and about and map sections on top
- Below follow tags according to user activity and most active topics
- Then the user can filter based on research, questions, comments etc and output is in a card format

### Passion

I am inspired by the motive of Public Labs to provide a better and cleaner world to live in. From childhood i have strongly felt the need for environmental conservation. I also love science and the very idea of DIY experiments to learn stuff excites me.

Improving the website for public labs would encourage better participation and promote a wonderful community to unite and discuss problems and make a change to this world. If i can be a small part of this change it would definitely mean something :)

### Audience

The target audience ie mainly of the age group 13-60 are perhaps the end users of [publiclab.org](http://publiclab.org). Improving UI has a direct impact on user experience and the end result of this project would achieve a easily understandable and usable version of the website along with changes to make the UI more appealing after considering various design aspects and choices. This forum is a perfect example of technology meets nature and science and I would love to see people benefit from it.

### Commitment

I have no other academic commitment in the months of may june and july and am ready to be fully dedicated and committed to this project and do my best in finishing it.
