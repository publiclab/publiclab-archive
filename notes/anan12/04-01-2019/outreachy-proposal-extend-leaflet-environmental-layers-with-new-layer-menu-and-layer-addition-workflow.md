## Project description\_\_

Extend Leaflet Environmental Layers with new layer menu and layer addition workflow

### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

Add additional structure to make the display/management of leaflet environmental layers smoother and maintainable and allow better data handling.

### Problem

Leaflet Environmental Layers - LEL - is a collection of different environmental map layers in an easy to use JavaScript Leaflet ([https://leafletjs.com](https://leafletjs.com)). This library is rapidly has many new layers being added, but there is no structure or workflow to it. When displayed the layers are not segregated conceptually and is hard for the user to understand the current process.

Project aims to add additional structure to make the display/management of leaflet
environmental layers smoother and maintainable and allow better data
flow/handling.

### Timeline/milestone\_s\_

Current map page

![image description](/i/30949.png "current.png")

- There are many layers in the side bar
- These layers are not organized
- Color coding is not very understandable
- There should be more demarcation between base layers and other added layers.

Tasks that can be implemented for better display and management of these layers and to make data handling smoother.

- standardization of layer types (for example tile, rss, csv, geojson, polygonal, also subtypes like spreadsheet, esri)
  - and code to reduce redundancy between similar layers, and make adding new layers of a generic type easier
- improved workflow for incorporating and accepting new layers (a submission template)
  - a submission form for new layers
- a minimal 'dots' based display of all layers
- create a tutorial for adding new layers using again a standard template
- create technical documentation for the leaflet layer code
- standardized layer metadata -- description, source, docs for each,
relevant bounding box and zoom levels, version, in a single file
- improved layer management system accounting for bounding boxes + zooms from layer metadata
- UI for highlighting (in the menu) new layers in current viewport as you drag/zoom
- standardization of per-item popup design (displaying image, description, source, toggle, link)
- additional layers for [oilandgasthreatmap.com](http://oilandgasthreatmap.com), OpenStreetMap
tag-based data layers, higher resolution wind data, and more
standardization of new map layers

Suggested changes

![image description](/i/30950.png "PublicLabs1.png")

- Add a toolbar functionality with language option and a nav bar design to follow the public lab website UI (NOTE: nav bar is optional considering this leaflet maps will be embedded in other public lab sites and might not need a nav bar)
- Options to zoom search full screen etc can be displayed with icons on the side
- Option to change layers and obtain the geojson files are displayed here too ie users can add their own geojon files for a particular cause to see the map display

![image description](/i/30951.png "PublicLabs2.png")

LAYER DISPLAY IMPROVEMENT

- Add a meaningful name to the base layers and this will be displayed on top like basic, streets etc. Presently working on this issue [https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-environmental-layers/pull/163](https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-environmental-layers/pull/163)
- Then one can select particular layers for a specific purpose to display data accordingly
- Layers are hierarchically listed as per public labs data model and they can be added
- An option can be given to change the Geojson files to see and track differences in display of maps
- Color coding of layers can be avoided and layers can be sorted based on type and purpose as shown

NOTE : Leaflet.js library and functions will be used to implement all this [https://leafletjs.com/](https://leafletjs.com/)

INTERNSHIP TASKS PLANNED

- Add new layers and look for similarities between them
- Follow the format of this pull request to install a Jasmine test
suite, load dependencies, and get "npm test" to pass with a very minimal
test: [https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location-display/pull/52-](https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location-display/pull/52)
- Connect the test to TravisCI using a .travis.yml file
- Add HTML test fixtures to allow tests to create and initialize a map
- Expand the test to check for proper map setup, following this example of UI testing: [https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location/pull/122/files](https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location/pull/122/files "https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location/pull/122/files")
- Identify common functions we could break out to reduce redundancy between layer code.
- Try making a common function which could be used to reduce redundant code in layers
- Write a test for this function
- Refactor layers to use the common function
- Repeat above for other common functions
- List out the different information which each layer requires, and
create a JSON format for storing it in a file. Look for how we can load
this information into using CommonJS syntax, like:
require('/layers/myLayerName/info.json')
- Try making a standard layer type which would make adding new layers
of a specific type easier (for example tile, rss, csv, geojson,
polygonal, also subtypes like spreadsheet, esri)
- Improve documentation of the repository to help in the process of understanding and adding new layers
- Develop an improved workflow for incorporating and accepting new
layers (a submission template), including a submission form for new
layers-Try developing a minimal 'dots' based display of all layers, based on [https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-environmental-layers/issues/123](https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-environmental-layers/issues/123)
- Develop a function which scans through available layers to see which
overlap with the current map bounds and zoom levels (and expand layer
metadata with these new fields if needed)
- Drive consensus on the Public labs data model for leaflet layers which a hierarchical listing of layers. Also drive agreement on a default set of quick select layers for the initial release
- Look for opportunities to breakup some of the internship tasks for newcomers and create FTO issues. Adding an additional layer option once the basic structure is setup could be an ideal FTO Issues.

```

```

NOTE: workflow and template for adding layers will be made in the middle and final phases after i have myself added new layers and analyzed them and their similarities with other layers. This will ensure more correctness and personalized opinions to design tutorials for newcomers etc. 

### Needs

I would need the guidance and help of my mentors and community members in reviewing my work and finishing the project.

### Contribution

- I have contributed to public lab repositories both frontend (in HTML CSS and JaveScript) and backed in ruby.
- As a contributor i have worked on solving bugs and fixing functionalities and reporting bugs and improvements as issues.
- I also helped create FTO issues to welcome newcomers into the community.
- I broke down big issues in 2-3 FTO's to encourage community growth and participation.

### Experience

PROJECT ON LEAFLET

I have worked on a project for Open Street Maps organization.(HOTOSM)  
A complete documentation of what i did can be found here.  
[https://github.com/ananyaarun/Open-Street-Maps](https://github.com/ananyaarun/Open-Street-Maps)

I did the following

1. Created geojson vector files
2. Set up my own vector tile server using Docker
3. Extracted OSM data
4. Visualised maps

The map visualized in leaflet.js is hosted here.

### Passion

I am inspired by the motive of Public Labs to provide a better and
cleaner world to live in. From childhood i have strongly felt the need
for environmental conservation. I also love science and the very idea of
DIY experiments to learn stuff excites me.

Improving workflow and display of maps would encourage better
participation and promote a wonderful community to unite and discuss
problems and make a change to this world. Users can use and benefit from these maps. If i can be a small part of
this change it would definitely mean something :)

### Audience

The target audience of this project are the users of these maps and the website. Improving UI and workflow of the maps will help users better understand use and benefit from them.
