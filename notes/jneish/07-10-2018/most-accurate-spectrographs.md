I am working with a grassroots-style bioremediation research team and we are hoping to use this tool to get preliminary results of some of our experiments before sending samples to analytical labs. Are there certain compounds or classes of compounds that work best with the spectrometer? We are primarily looking at heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons and OC pesticides.
