I am wondering what light source is best for the lego spectrometer - I remember an old writeup discussing halogen bulbs and fluorescing laser pointers. Are these still suggested?

  
We are hoping to use the spectrometer to measure the concentration of various petroleum hydrocarbons. Has anyone experimented with various light sources for similar studies and found one they like best? In the spirit of open source data, we would like to be able to compare spectrographs but differing light sources would make this less helpful...
