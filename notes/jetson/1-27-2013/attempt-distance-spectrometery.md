I was attempting to see if I could detect a sample light source at a distance (I know astronomers can do this to determine the elemental makeup of distant stars). I attached an old rifle scope and my spectrometer to a piece of plywood, balanced it so I could mount it on a tripod and added a short length of tubing to act as a spotting (aiming actually) scope.
Unfortunately, the amount of light coupled into the spectrometer was not sufficient to register a reading. If blast a laser pointer into the end of the scope, the webcam registered a small amount of light, but apparently the slit blocks enough of the available light to prevent a useable reading of streetlamps and sun illuminated objects during the day..
Does anyone know the specs of the webcams in the kick-starter spectrometers? I'm interested in the minimum light required for an image measured in lux. I am hoping that a camera with better low light performance might work in this application.
