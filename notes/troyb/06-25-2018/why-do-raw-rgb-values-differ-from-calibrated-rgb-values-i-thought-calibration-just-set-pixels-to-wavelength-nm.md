Here are the first lines of spectra 137547\.

Calibrated:

| Average| Red| Green| Blue|
| 12.7| 7.65| 10.2| 22.95|
| 12.7| 7.65| 10.2| 22.95|
| 12.7| 7.65| 10.2| 22.95|
| 12.7| 7.65| 10.2| 22.95|
| 12.7| 7.65| 10.2| 22.95|

Uncalibrated:

| Average| Red| Green| Blue|
| 15| 10| 12| 23|
| 15| 10| 12| 23|
| 15| 10| 12| 25|
| 14| 8| 11| 24|
| 14| 8| 11| 24|
  

The small differences could matter for my daughter's project, measuring a greenness index (green minus blue) to estimate whether algae are growing, especially after we had to recalibrate.
