###What I want to do or know

I'd like to hear advice and find resources that can help us investigate the thermal properties of paved surfaces on a boarding school campus, to inform decisions about materials upgrades in future years. 

###Background story

A group of students at this high school -- mostly seniors --will be taking on aerial mapping projects on a variety of topics, to gain experience designing, executing, and communicating results of a project. 

I have been canvassing the community for ideas about what projects would be useful, and the Director of Facilities had this idea about paved surfaces. 

We recently acquired a Seek Thermal Compact XR camera, which plugs into an iPhone (http://www.thermal.com/products/compactxr/). I've attached a test photo taken from a second floor balcony, which shows a paved pathway with lawn on either side, and give the min/max temperatures detected in the image.

I believe that detecting the temperature differences in the evening should be pretty straightforward, if we can solve the problem of how to safely fly the camera (mounting an iphone with fragile attachment), and maintain enough stability to gather clear images.

But I don't know much about how to translate that into more sophisticated concepts such as "urban heat island." 

And I would be interested to know of any tips, or warnings about undertaking a project like this.

Many thanks.
