June 7, 2017 @ 1:00 - 2:30 pm EST  

On Wednesday June 7, 2017, the EPA Office of Air Quality and Planning Standards will host a webinar from 1:00-2:30 pm EST on "Citizen Science Air Monitoring." This webinar will provide an overview of the tools that are used to conduct citizen science projects involving low-cost air sensor technology and educate communities on best practices for successful air monitoring projects.

The availability of low cost (less than $2,500) sensors has increased the popularity of citizen environmental data collection which allows community members to collect and analyze data and interpret the results. Many of the communities' projects have helped to solve complex real-world problems, identify research questions, and make new discoveries.

During this webinar, community representatives will also be on hand to discuss their community air monitoring projects and lessons learned. If you are interested in learning more about air sensor technology, study design, community air monitoring case studies, and resources available for conducting successful air monitoring projects, please review the webinar details to join.
