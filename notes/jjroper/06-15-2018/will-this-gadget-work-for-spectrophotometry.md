I study birds, and in some species, both sexes look the same, although we have evidence that there are color differences (including in UV, but that's a different problem) and I wonder if this device can be used to catch a spectrum from light reflected off feathers? Thanks in advance!

  
The birds are several species of hummingbirds, but if it works with them, I'd try it out on other species too. I live in southern Brazil and am an ornithologist.
