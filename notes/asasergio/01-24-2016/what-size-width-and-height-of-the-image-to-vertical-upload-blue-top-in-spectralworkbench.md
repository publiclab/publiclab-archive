I need to know if an image filed in the smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S3), to be upload in SpectralWorkbench, need to have standard size (height and width), or sides in a particular proportion, and what would it be.

I resized (edit) the image, captured with my smartphone, so that it looks like the example "Vertical, blue on top" (landscape) of the upload SpectralWorkbench page and as a result, after the upload, the image can not be calibrated.
