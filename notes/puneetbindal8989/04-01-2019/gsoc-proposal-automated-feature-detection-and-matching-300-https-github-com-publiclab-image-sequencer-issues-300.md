## Project description

_Here, you don't have to have a complete proposal when you begin. Just tell us some of your ideas and we'll help you refine it into a full proposal gradually!_

### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

Enhancement for Image-Sequencer, A module that detects the object features of an image and match them with another image.

### Problem

_What problem(s) does your project solve?_

_Computer Vision problem_

_issue no. #300 image-sequencer __https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues/300_

### Approach

To solve this issue my approach is get around the best js libraries.

---------

  
We have 3 opensource most used libraries for computer vision i.e :-

1\. Opencvjs

2\. Jsfeat

3\. Trackingjs

  
---------

  
To find the best library lets find the difference:-

  
Opencv.js has only feature for object detection using HAAR Cascades. The tracking.js library(Light weight library ~ 7Kb ) provides the BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features) descriptors and its JSFeat extension---ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF).Which means that even if you rotate an object, the algorithm can still detect it. Moreover, the JSFeat library provide an example using the image pyramid, which is scale invariant too.

  
Implementation: 

  
---------

  
  
  
### Timeline/milestones

_Break your project up into small projects -- one per week!_

See this page for guidance on breaking your plan up into small, self-contained parts: [https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-18-2018/software-outreach-modularity-is-great-for-collaboration](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-18-2018/software-outreach-modularity-is-great-for-collaboration "https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-18-2018/software-outreach-modularity-is-great-for-collaboration")

  
### Needs

_What resources will you need: people, documentation, literature, sample data, hardware if applicable_
