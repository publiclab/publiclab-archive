#### 

**Introduction:**

In
this manual, I would like to include the necessary information on the devices
and software that I have worked with and to share my understanding and approach
to fulfill the goals of this project. I also split the contents into different
sections for different parts of the device.

**IC
board & TI Lauchpad:  
**We
start with the WheeStat kit from Smoky Mountain Scientific. The kit has
built-in functions for electrochemical analysis, e.g., cyclic voltammetry, differential
pulse voltammetry, chronoamperometry, etc. It comes with a self-designed IC
board and a TI Lauchpad EK-TM4C123GXL. The IC board has the necessary circuit
for our experiment, e.g., the current emitter follower, the voltage emitter follower,
a few noise filters, etc. Also, it is designed to work with several types of voltammetry,
so it is possible to redesign the circuit to make it smaller and cheaper.
Unfortunately, due to the lack of knowledge and time, I wasn't able to fully
understand the mechanism of the IC board. Therefore, we will leave this to someone
who specializes in circuit design in the future.

The
TI Lauchpad is originally an interface between the user and the IC board. It
takes inputs from a computer, e.g., the type of voltammetry, the starting and
ending voltage, the steps, the current gain, the scan rate, etc. Then, it sends
the corresponding signals to the IC board and collects the output (the analog
voltage and current reading) from the IC board. On the Lauchpad, we notice
there is a switch at the corner. We need to make sure the switch is on the
debug mode and we are going to use the micro-USB port right next to the switch.

**Energia:**

The
programming language used on the Lauchpad is called Energia which is based on
Arduino. To install it, we go to their website and download the software. We
need to make sure the name of the file with the main functions (setup() and
loop()) matches up with the name of its parent folder so Enegia would open the entire
project correctly.

To
compile the source code from WheeStat, we also have to introduce an external library
called altSPI. It is a bit tricky to include external libraries in Energia so I
will provide the steps below:

1)
![image description](/i/41100.png "ws1.png")  
Go to
File-\>Preference. The sketchbook location is provided at the top.

2)
Go
to this directory and create a folder called "libraries" if not already exists.

3)
Put
the altSPI folder inside the "libraries" folder we just created.![image description](/i/41101.png "ws2.png")

  
Another
issue we might encounter is the software doesn't choose the correct board
automatically. For our TI Lauchpad, we need to go to Tools-\>Board-\>Boards
Manager. Then, we search for "TivaC" and install the "Energia TivaC boards".
After these steps, we can try to verify the code and it should successfully
compile. At this point, we can connect the Lauchpad to our PC and upload our
code.

During
this summer, I cleaned up the original Energia code from WheeStat to make it
more readable and to get rid of the features that we don't need. The modified
version has 8 classes and I will briefly explain what each class does.

1)
analogRead:
This class provides the current and voltage analog read function. Since the
output of the Lauchpad represents the current and voltage in scale, we need to
convert the scaled values into human-readable values.

2)
DiffPulse:
This class provides the differential pulse method for stripping voltammetry.
However, it only sweeps the voltage in one direction without closing a loop.
Therefore, we still need to modify this method or create another class to
accomplish the full cycle for stripping voltammetry.

3)
digi\_pot:
This class sets up the digital ports according to the resistors used on the IC
board. We need to modify it if we come up with a new IC board design in the
future.

4)
Open\_circuit:
The name of this class is misleading. Instead of measuring the open circuit
potential, it cuts off the current after each run.

5)
preDeposit:
This class provides voltage to deposit the metal ions onto the electrode.

6)
reset:
This class could reset the Lauchpad when needed.

7)
setupRun:
This class deals with the serial connection between the Lauchpad and the
external device. It reads and stores the input parameters.

8)
WheeStatE\_7c\_modified:
This class contains the main functions. It integrates the classes mentioned
above and calls the functions when needed. After the clean-up, it has two
features which are the stripping voltammetry and open circuit potential
measurement.

The
behavior of the Lauchpad follows the code very well. However, the voltage on
the electrode sometimes doesn't seem to be reasonable. For example, we measured
the voltage across the working and counter electrode without putting them in
solution or starting any experiment. The result was 14V whereas we set it to be
0V in the code. We haven't resolved this issue yet, but we suppose that it originates
from the IC board because the output pins on the Lauchpad work as expected.

**Python
& Machine Learning:**

The
original analysis code is written in Processing which is a programming language
based on Java. Since our ultimate product will use machine learning to optimize
the parameters, the user doesn't need to see the graphical interface of our
analysis software. Therefore, I choose to rewrite it in Python so we can
integrate it with any ML algorithm easily. There are three classes so far:

1)
connect.py:
It uses the Pyserial library to set up a serial connection. It can send the
parameters to the kit and reads the experiment outputs with the correct format.

2)
dataTools.py:
It is very empty now, but this will be an interface between the ML algorithm
and the control code in the future.

3)
Main.py:
It contains the main function to run the program.

Also,
we are missing a class to set up a Bluetooth serial connection because we can't
make the Bluetooth work on the raspberry pi.

In
stripping voltammetry, the two most important parameters are the scan rate and
the current gain. We usually adjust them manually in the chemistry lab. In our
project, we use a ML algorithm to solve this problem. We will use the
convolutional neural network to find a relationship between the values of the input
parameters (the scan rate and the current gain) and the goodness of the output datasets.
Also, we want the software to adjust the input parameters accordingly to get a
better output. However, we are not able to come up with a trained model because
of the lack of datasets.

In
the end, we will transfer the Python control code and the trained ML model to a
raspberry pi. Therefore, the user could connect to our kit through Bluetooth.
And our kit can conduct the experiment and analyze the data by itself so that anyone
can use our product without any prerequisite knowledge in science.

**Raspberry
Pi:**

We
use a RPI (raspberry pi) as another interface to make our kit more user-friendly.
The first step is to install the operating system. The official RPI website
provides a handy tool called "Raspberry Pi Imager". I choose the Raspberry Pi
OS Lite because we don't need the graphical interface. However, lots of the
python libraries and packages must be installed manually for this lite version.
We also need to use the SSH connection to communicate with the RPI and it requires
the RPI to connect to a WIFI in advance. I will show the tutorial below:

1)
Go
to the SD card directory after the OS is installed.

2)
Create
an empty file called "ssh" and save it.

3)
Create
another file called "wpa\_supplicant.conf" and paste the related scripts from
additional information into it.

4)
Modifies
the country code, network name, and network password and save the file.

5)
Boot
the RPI and wait for a few minutes.

6)
Find
the IP address of the RPI. 

a)
Use
"Angry IP Scanner" on Windows or Mac.

b)
Log
onto the admin page of your router and find which devices are connected.

7)
Open
any SSH terminal on your PC and use the IP address to connect to the RPI. The
default password the "raspberrypi".

We
can easily transfer the files through SSH connection by using the "scp"
command. The last thing I want to mention is the Bluetooth setup. Though I still
couldn't make it work after desperately trying to solve the issue, I would
provide the link with expected instruction: [https://scribles.net/setting-up-bluetooth-serial-port-profile-on-raspberry-pi/](https://scribles.net/setting-up-bluetooth-serial-port-profile-on-raspberry-pi/). My issue was
that I could pair the phone with the RPI successfully, but the connection
dropped after 1 or 2 seconds every time. And my suggestion is to install the
full version of Raspberry Pi OS. Then, we can try the Bluetooth tool in the
graphical interface.

**Conclusion:**

This
manual includes most of the handy resources which I have used and some of them
take a long time to find. So, I wish it could help people who want to reproduce
these steps or to develop this project. It also has a few unresolved problems and
we welcome anyone's suggestions. Last but not the least, I would like to thank
Jose Castro and Advanced Water Testing for providing such a great opportunity,
and it's a pleasure to work with you.
