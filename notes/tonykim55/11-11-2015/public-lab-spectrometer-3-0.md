###What I want to do

###My attempt and results

I just completed the assembly of Public Lab 
Spectrometer 3.0.

I placed 100 watt light bulb in front of the slit.
When I turn on the catch 
in the lap top software, nothing shows up
on the screen as if wire is not connected together.

What am I doing wrong?

Help is needed.


###Questions and next steps

###Why I'm interested
