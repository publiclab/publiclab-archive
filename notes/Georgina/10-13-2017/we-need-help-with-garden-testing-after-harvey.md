I'm writing to check for advice on evaluating the produce from a school garden. The question is from my sister, Lala, whose school garden was flooded during Harvey a few weeks ago. Others at her school consider evaluating the produce by sending samples to Texas A&M. This process might take a while, and in the meantime, they're not allowing students to eat vegetables from the garden.  Lala was wondering whether there's a quicker way to evaluate produce locally.
