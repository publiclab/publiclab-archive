Hi all,

I got a clandon metascop and I would love to connect it to a ccd camera in order of using it,  provide so good spectral. I am mainly interested in gold, silver, copper, zinc, alloys. May you suggest to me what kind of camera may I buy? I guess a cooled monocrome.
Suggestions are wecolme.

Thanks!
