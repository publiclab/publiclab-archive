I studied microbiology in college and have strayed from that field in my profession.  I've been inspired to get back into the game by an [article](http://draftmag.com/native-ales-yeast/) published in Draft Magazine in April of 2013. I have a friend that is a skilled brewer who is game for helping me with this project.  I've found tips and tricks on isolating local yeast strains on brewing blogs and websites, but when I contacted my former micro professor she said that, while the project sounds fun, it is next to impossible to isolate yeast.  Her experiences with isolating yeast in the lab resulted in specimens that were contaminated by bacteria or fungi 90% of the time.  

Keeping in mind that my lab space will likely be my kitchen, does anyone have any experience with this?  Am I embarking on a fruitless endeavor? I look forward to any advice you can give me.
