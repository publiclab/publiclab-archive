Hi all, warm Greetings 

I am new in NIR photography so i have some questions regarding the white balencing, caliberation etc. Actually i have Nikon D70s Camera modifed for NIR imaging. I got replaced the internal hot mirror filter with the filter that can pass Red and NIR light only. i.e my camera can now pass only NIR and Red band of light. My purpose is to generate the NDVI image from the  image that i take with this modifed camera. Actually i have to convert the digital DN values to the reflectance for calculating NDVI. I am not sure how to do this?

Another thing is that i have to separate RED and NIR from the single image. Because NIR is mixed in each band (RGB) and the sensitivity of the three different Bayer filter might not be same for NIR light. So how can i separate NIR and RED from the image? Any other suggesstion on getting NDVI with this modifed digital camera will be highly appriciated. 
Regards
