###What I want to do

As part of the Nature Center map, Lauren Sullivan, Tim, and Scott Eustis joined Amy Legaux of Audubon Nature Center and we mapped the nature center trail by balloon.  <br><br>

Amy Gave us a map of what has been done where for reference.<br><br>

Scott took pole selfies with a RGB camera.<br><br>

Here's the imagery from the balloon mapping.<br>

###My attempt and results

Great weather for the balloon.<br><br>

Images had great coverage. we are unsure how to undistort the image to get a map from the infragram point and shoot, though.<br>

###Questions and next steps
 
need to color match the levels smooth them out. <br><br>

then stevie wants us to use infragram, rather than fastiegram it in GIMP. <br><br>

fastiegram includes<br><br>

Lens Distortion == -34<br>
Levels == move center up to heighten contrast<br>
Channels == color components, channel mixer, Switch B and R<br>
Hue and Saturation == up both 20. <br><br>


other infragrams include<br>

###Why I'm interested

This is part of EPA Urban Water grant.  Molly and stevie also made maps tonight.
