last week, Scott Eustis, Scott Anderson, India Bush, Raynesha Jordan, and Aaliyah Marrero, in coordination with Eric Kugler of Common Ground relief, got in the canoe and paddled the ghost forest of the Bienvenue triangle.  This was part of an instructional mapping exercise.

The area was once a swamp, but has subsided.  Many dead stumps of cypress remain. Counting and locating these was to be part of a larger exercise, mapping Caffin Ave from wetland to the River, including the existing wetlands before an ongoing restoration project is completed.

Some instructions are learned the hard way.  Embarrassingly, the camera was out of focus for those shots taken.

Posted as a reminder to make sure the A495 is auto-focused on the horizon before the launch.
