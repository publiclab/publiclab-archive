[Kayakityat, Friends of Bayou St. John., City Park, and Urban Conservancy ](https://www.nola.com/environment/2019/02/neighbors-fight-back-invasive-plant-floating-in-bayou-st-john.html)have all sprung into action, following a Salvinia invasion of the Bayou from the Lake. 

LDWF has placed boom. between the lake end of the bayou and the city end.

_Bayou St. John neighbors gathered last weekend with rakes and shovels to take on a mutual enemy: giant salvinia. Large swaths of the invasive species have been floating in the bayou since mid-January and neighbors are concerned the problem will only get worse.

Giant salvinia is an invasive fern from South America. It was first documented in Louisiana in 1988.._
