non-profit science is stepping into the role the U.S. Coast Guard has abdicated.

The Toxic Gulf
Uncalculated Aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill
From Surfer, Kyle Denuccio, July 18, 2012

"Their most essential tool was a high-powered UV light that Kirby says he first used to detect engine leaks while serving in the Coast Guard in 1971. When the specially calibrated light is shone on oil, it glows a bright yellow, making it easy to identify. They aren’t cheap, however, retailing for $3,350 from the New Hampshire-based company, ARA Vertek."


"ndependent researchers like James Kirby and organizations like Surfrider aren’t expecting compensation for the thousands of dollars spent on equipment and lab testing in their studies. Instead, they hope their work might lead to a revision of the National Contingency Plan, which specifies how to respond to future oil spills. Discontinuing the use of chemicals such as Corexit and more stringent screening processes for determining whether a beach is clean or toxic seem like minimally decent compensation for their work.

Today Sturdivant is back in the water, using his body to discern whether it’s safe to surf near his home. He no longer spends time sitting on the beach due to the high levels of contamination, but wouldn’t think of leaving the Gulf Coast. “I’m choosing to live in a place that’s beautiful and where I can go surfing by walking down the street,” he said. “We make those decisions about what’s important in life and set up our lives around what we love.”"
