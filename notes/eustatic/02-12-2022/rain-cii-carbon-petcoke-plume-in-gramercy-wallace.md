Rain CII carbon is blowing a lot of Petcoke into the air while they are loading.  
1:14p.m. Friday February 11th, wind is blowing from the north north northwest.  
My mouth feels pretty dry but I'm not coughing and I'm definitely going to put on my kn95 mask on an otherwise sunny day where people are jogging on the levee.

here's a before picture. Could people do a Method 9 analysis on this?
