inspired by <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/jetson/1-27-2013/attempt-distance-spectrometery">Jetson's post</a>

Do we need the scope for distance spectrometry? is that going to help limit what light enters the box?

What about a telescope rather than a gun scope?

Does the flare produce the kind of light appropriate to long-distance spectrometry?  i.e. flame spec rather than adsorption spec?

Should we target the flare at night so that the light hitting our spectrometer is more exclusively from the flare?

Side Note:
about half the time, Cancer alley residents can use the <a href="http://alerts.skytruth.org">skytruth alert system </a>to be notified of flaring events / cross reference them to see what the companies are admitting to releasing. This is a national alert system, and i would think that refineries in other areas would be more diligent about reporting, in case there are other refinery communities in the US that want to target the flare stacks with the spectrometer.

<b>Let's consider some photos and videos taken of flare stacks from distance. </b>

Here is Marathon from the highway at dusk.  you can see the flares on the right, some minor flare stacks mixed in with the massive array of halogens.  [click for video]
