Here I archive the signature development for human classification of abandoned gravel mines on the Tangipahoa and Amite Rivers in Louisiana.   This was published as part of Basics of the Basin in the years after the 2016 flood.

  
Federal Mine reclamation sidelines gravel mines, and the Louisiana Lege is structured to oppose wetland restoration on mining rivers--Senator Body White, in particular, district 6, commands a district that only includes these areas, and stonewalls any reclamation efforts via agnotological techniques.   

  
Organizations like Nature Conservancy also oppose Mine Reclamation as "too difficult" and politically "impossible."  Louisiana Wildlife Federation supports these efforts, but, because Senator Cassidy opposes them, cannot make progress.

  
And yet, Denham Springs flooded in the 2016 rains because of the loss of Floodplain Forests to gravel mines, costing Louisiana on the order of $10 Billion for that one event. 

  
Gulf Restoration Network attempted to pick up where LDNR abandoned the abandoned mines. Our publications will be referenced in a future research note.

  
Using techniques developed for the NWI by the National Wetland Research Center in Lafayette, we created Signatures for Classification of Aerial Photography .

  
Those signatures are recorded here:

| |
| <div style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 802px; left: 3px;"><div style="float: left;">that is to say, it's a standardized accounting for the reasoning behind why we draw lines around shapes and colors in photographs.</div></div>|
| |
| <div style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 600px; left: 3px;"><div style="float: left;">There is much more information in photographs than color, and this sheet serves both</div></div>|
| <div style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 398px; left: 3px;"><div style="float: left;">as a reminder to use that kind of information in the photograph</div></div>|
| <div style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 499px; left: 3px;"><div style="float: left;">but also integrate information from outside the photography (especially field visits)</div></div>|
| <div style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 499px; left: 3px;"><div style="float: left;">in order to make the most coherent delination of vegetation types we can.</div></div>|

| <div style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 196px; left: 3px;"><div style="float: left;">Science strives to be repeatable</div></div>|
| <div style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 600px; left: 3px;"><div style="float: left;">and so computer algorithms are in development to replace humans for aerial photo interpretation</div></div>|
| <div style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 600px; left: 3px;"><div style="float: left;">but this is the documentation of the human algorithm being used to interpret a particular photo</div></div>|

| RULES|
| <div style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 196px; left: 3px;"><div style="float: left;">use as much info as you can</div></div>|
| <div style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 903px; left: 3px;"><div style="float: left;">make a new sheet in the workbook for each type of delineation you make. each mapknitter project, say, should have a workbook with multiple Signatures</div></div>|
| <div style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 499px; left: 3px;"><div style="float: left;">draw your delineation line at a scale of 1:3000 or higher resolution, 4000ft</div></div>|
| <div style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 398px; left: 3px;"><div style="float: left;">fear no subjectivity, but be able to defend all your decisions.</div></div>|
| |
| <div style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 802px; left: 3px;"><div style="float: left;">With any luck, other humans will be able to glean useful information about the landscape from your aerial photo interpretation.</div></div>|
| <div style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 196px; left: 3px;"><div style="float: left;">Love and wisdom,</div></div>|
