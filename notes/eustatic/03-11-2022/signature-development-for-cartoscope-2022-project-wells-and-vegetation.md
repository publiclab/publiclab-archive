For [Cartosco.pe](https://cartosco.pe/#/home), there was a need to develop a classification for unplugged coastal Louisiana wells that have been left unvegetated. 

  
The [LDNR 2016 source imagery](http://sonris-www.dnr.state.la.us/gis/agsweb/IE/JSViewer/index.html?TemplateID=181) was the same as the [land loss lookout project](https://publiclab.org/wiki/openhour-archive#October+5:+Applying+Aerial+Imagery+and+Community+Mapping+-+Lessons+from+the+Land+Loss+Lookout+Project), and Sophie and Aswin created a [photoset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zlcBS0llgtm06UQCcd-XSEdVeLKofblM) for the project. 

  
Scott created [three signatures](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-9hJ_JmVo06nINM7Lyj3ID8wZW8cZzt5F96nV7lPMng/edit#gid=16105744) for his classification of unplugged, inactive wells.  Inactive wells are supposed to have their sites revegetated under Louisiana Law, 90 days after drilling or production operations have ceased.  Of course, this law is unenforced, due to litigation pressure from oil and gas operators.   

  
HG Signature Development Assessment Summary for Aerial Photo Classification:  Wells and Vegetation  

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-9hJ\_JmVo06nINM7Lyj3ID8wZW8cZzt5F96nV7lPMng/edit#gid=16105744](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-9hJ_JmVo06nINM7Lyj3ID8wZW8cZzt5F96nV7lPMng/edit#gid=16105744)  

  
The Classification took three hours--one hour to arrange the desktop, and two hours for the classifications.

  
The Results are posted to the classification [workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-9hJ_JmVo06nINM7Lyj3ID8wZW8cZzt5F96nV7lPMng/edit#gid=1199524348). 

  
A Table was created, by company, for the companies with the most inactive wells whose sites have not be re-vegetated after the cessation of operations. 

  
The Table for the Companies with more than one Unvegetated, Inactive Well is below. The list is similar the list of companies that regularly spill oil into these wetlands--HilCorp, Texas Petroleum Investment Company, Mesa Gulf Coast LLC, and S2 Energy LLC.

  
Mesa Gulf Coast LLC was from Covington, but [filed for Bankruptcy during the Trump administration](https://www.inforuptcy.com/browse-filings/louisiana-eastern-bankruptcy-court/2:19-bk-12533/bankruptcy-case-mesa-gulf-coast-llc "https://www.inforuptcy.com/browse-filings/louisiana-eastern-bankruptcy-court/2:19-bk-12533/bankruptcy-case-mesa-gulf-coast-llc").

S2 Energy LLC was from Covington as well, but [spilled much during Ida](https://www.flickr.com/photos/healthygulf/51650678861/), and [was sold to Krewe Energy](http://www.dv-llc.com/krewe-energy-completes-acquisition-of-assets-of-s2-energy-llc/) in Texas.
