###What I want to do

Take aerials of Bayou St John, as ever.  Initial winter plantings have been done, more because there were plants available than a great expectation of success.

More plantings that will take root are planned for February.

The expectation of where sediment rests has changed.  The sandbars are not even, but have a hill and trough shape because this area has become a area of high activity, thanks to the new channel. 

more sediment has been placed in front of the bag-wall, and plants planted.  this also gives the wall a more natural depth profile.  Great Egret was seen using this area. (pictured)

There was a unique combination of low water and light wind last saturday.  Jordan came out and we flew some kites for way too long.  fun.

We slapped a  rig together (pictured) for a wideangle hi-res camera (pictured) with extra rubber bands--two camera loops and four points of stabiliization were snapped and wrapped with micro-carabiners ($1 a pop). 

So this rig was, at once, fancier and more crude than normal.

###My attempt and results

This camera model comes with a Wifi signal emitter; thus we were able to live preview the camera frame, even at the highest elevation.

###Questions and next steps

This is another set of photos for dredgefest, showing the progression of water to marshland over the next few months.
