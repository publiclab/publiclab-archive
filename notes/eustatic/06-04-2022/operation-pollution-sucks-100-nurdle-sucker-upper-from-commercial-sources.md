On the [Nurdle Patrol facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/352470642178839/), user [Nick Castillo](https://www.facebook.com/groups/352470642178839/user/100078774291290) posted his use of a home garden clippings vacuum to vacuum nurdles from a rail ballast yard. Nick credits Galveston Bay Foundation's Nurdle 101 class for the motivation.

  
"this is the N.S.U device Nurdle Sucker Upper."

"So I found a laundry bag with a mesh large enough for nurdles to pass through from Walmart and a crawfish bag to catch the nurdles and release dirt or sand from Academy Sports. Tomorrow we will see if 

"Operation: Pollution Sucks" 

will work! 

In my head it does"

  
"Just a leaf vacuum with two different size mesh bags I found. One just large enough for the nurdles to pass through and one just small enough to catch the nurdles but release the dirt or sand!"

  
The intake mesh is too small for sticks, but bigger, is tough (you will drag it through rocks) and it is tight, mounted with zip ties. 

  
The receiver mesh is smaller, softer, and holds nurdles (fresh ones at the rail ballast, probably 4mm-6mm) and drops sand (sand is heavy for its size, very dense)

All thanks to Nick for cleaning this stuff up!   I think Louisiana waters can benefit from this.
