I wanted to show Howard the balloon. Up and down in a flash. Calm day, short rope, we flew a point and shoot Canon (810) as well as a gopro. We have a bit of the GoPro somewhere.

Next Step would be to actually record the plume. it is much closer than I had thought, about 725 ft east of the dock. 1000ft of line could survey the plume. that is kayakable for certain, so school groups may not even need a boat, but a fool in the kayak.

the bait shop nearby may be friendly, might be worth it to organize a friendly boat, but seems unnecessary with a high alt line or simple canoe (kayak might be too exposed to acid waters.)

Halter Marine is another offender--[see this research note](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/05-23-2014/mississippi-phosphates-better-air-for-alice)

This is just after a rain! all the dust was suppressed. We caught them on video, see ms Alice's note earlier.
