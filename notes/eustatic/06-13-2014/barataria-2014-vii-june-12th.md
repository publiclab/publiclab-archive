<br> this survey was done with a peak in the tide around 1pm. 

###What I want to do

this is the sixth outing for the barataria work. Scott, Matt P, Dan B, and Stevie E from PublicLab went out with Capt Dave of Big Dog Charters.<br>

The balloon worked very well, after we had inflated it to 1.8 kg of lift. Normally, we have only inflated the balloon to .8 kg, and have had problems.  1.8kg for .5 kg of payload was magic. also the weather was perfect, all day, with no switch in wind. we repeatedly got the balloon to 283 yards plus in a very rapid amount of time.<br>

Is this weather only in the summertime? why was this time working so much more smoothly than the last times?<br>

We had a tarp to hold the balloon down when on plane in the boat.<br>

We invented a way to crank the spool with a leatherman. It works best with three people, one to hold tension, one to de-tangle the line and guide the line into the spool, and one to crank on the spool.  We should get a line that has mounted onto a electrician's spool.<br>
