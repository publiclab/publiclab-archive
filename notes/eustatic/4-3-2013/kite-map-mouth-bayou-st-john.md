Another map of a "before" the restoration project. I need to do a second run north of the bridge, to capture the sandbar without so much distortion

mappers:  scott eustis, solo
kite:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Into-The-Wind-Leigh-Little/dp/B003B3KUFS">little bear</a>
camera: powershot 1400
rig:  soda bottle
time:  3 hours

Started mapping on the west side of the bayou, but found that there was a lot more runway on the east side. the combination of lake, levee, and runway, as well as future wetlands, make this spot a prime spot for teaching aerial mapping of wetlands with kites and balloons. 

There are also lots of dog owners and fishermen out, regularly.
