Re: our discussion of design aesthetics

here is a post from Bayou Manchac <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bayou-Manchac/311089963611">group on Facebook,</a> advocating against the dumping of sewerage by Country Club of Louisiana

Note that the text is not in bubbles, but generally a yellow, red, or orange color to contrast with the browns and greys of the forested landscape.

Note the use of arrows and dots.

Note the white underneath the text that is unclear.  

Whether or not this map was drawn in microsoft paint (or equiv. apple software) it is something that can be drawn in these widely available formats. 

This aesthetic of "text directly on image" is something that has been done since photography began.
