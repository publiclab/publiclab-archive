####DRAFT

###What I wanted to do

Compare time spent, quality, and expense of Kite photos of Bayou St John wetland vs photos form a new/old drone quadcopter.

I wanted to evaluate the ability of either to lift different payloads

* Infragram on a bolt attached to a soda bottle rig (v light .040 kg, but instable in the wind (flies off nadir often))
* Saturn V setup with a Canon 1400is (LiPo battery, 0.435 kg)
* Titan 2 setup (stripped down, 2x Canon 2300, 0.620 kg)

- Used DJI Phantom 2 (no cameras or anything) 1.01 kg
- Canmore photologger  0.025kg (v close to the error margin of the scale itself)

Attached cardboard tails to the Titan 2 for helicopter flight, since the spread of the copter legs is small--the picavet is made for a kite; it will likely rotate and blur the pics. 

I can rarely get the kite to lift the Titan 2 with a 7' Delta in the unstable winds around New Orleans. The other two work well with the 7' Delta; I wanted to see if the copter could lift these, especially the Titan 2.  

###My attempt and results

##On June 5th
I arrived onsite with the materials.  But the quadcopter wouldn't turn on.  So all I have are kite pictures. Irony.  I don't know if this counts as a test.  

disspirited, I only flew the Infragram + Canmore on the 7' Delta on 3000' line. It took about 45 minutes to get the shot, because i misread the wind and had to launch twice.

Infragram save is messed up --2250%?<br>

[note to self, wear bathing suit at BSJ site and you can cross the water instead of winding in a re-launching the kite]

### Take 2 Sunday June 12th, 2016
no wind, hot, thunder
92 degrees and overcast<br>
Weighed the rigs<br>

Canmore photologger is light light.<br>

Crashed the helicopter into tree (I think it's ok).<br>

Rain started before I got to fly, but I think I can get it flying next time. Rebar in the levee armoring might be messing with the GPS signaling to the DJI phantom 2.

###Questions and next steps
June 5th was a high water event, which is interesting.  Since Andy's departure from maintaining the site, I do think stem density is down;  it at least seems patchy for Spartina species.<br>

June 12th was also high water.  wake up earlier next week, to beat the thunderstorm.
