### Summahtime

Bright summer day, little wind, but big kite and reel power equals map<br><br>

big PL kit kite<br>
big 3000 reel, churn came in handy<br>
canon 1400is<br>
soda bottle rig<br><br>

there wasn't a lot of wind. the kite would float downwind slowly when the reel was released, but the reel would slowly grind to a halt.  I would then crank the reel a few turns, and hold, until the kite climbed to a point where it would pull the reel to turning once again.  kind of like a ratchet system with diminishing returns (and taking up a longer and longer amount of time). 

i had wanted to use the line counter to measure the length of string, and use geo cam to get an angle on the kite, but my hands were quite occupied with the action of the reel, and directing the kite in low wind. 

I moved from the levee to a position under the bridge in order to fly the kite into position where the bridge was visible to the camera.
