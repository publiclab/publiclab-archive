We are recovering from Hurricane Ida, which hit Grand Isle, Lafourche, Terrebonne, Lower Plaquemines, Grand Isle / Lafitte, LaPlace, St James, and entire the New Orleans area as a powerful Cat 5\.

Gulf communities are going need a lot of help in the days and weeks to come, please consider a generous donation to any of these organizations:

1. Gulf South for a Green New Deal Community-Controlled Fund ([Click here to donate](http://bit.ly/GS4GNDCCF))

"Gulf South for a Green New Deal Community Controlled Fund (GS4GND CCF) promotes just transitions away from extractive practices while dismantling oppressive structures which harm our communities and, ultimately, our ecology. We believe people on and of the land should control what happens to the land; the people of the South must control what happens in the South. This regenerating, community-controlled fund provides resources to foster power and promote togetherness in the region and exists to restore communities and to honor the legacy of strength and resistance in the Gulf South." \[ [Social media graphics ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nCALMkSt6RpsHvqwSLjWzMPgfFwlqA1e?eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=d45d2439-4917-4db9-a96b-2b4bf851c30a)from [GCCLP](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nCALMkSt6RpsHvqwSLjWzMPgfFwlqA1e?eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=d45d2439-4917-4db9-a96b-2b4bf851c30a): \]
