After Ida, FEMA gave Civilian Air Patrol the Disaster Response Mission that [NGS](https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/) has sometimes, like after [Harvey](https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/storms/harvey/index.html#16/29.7367/-95.2286). 

  
NOAA has many more mapping resources than Civilian Air Patrol, whose web interface is difficult to use.

Using NOAA's ERMA interface, the photos are easier to find.  

  
I made this spreadsheet to help me find CAP photos by request.  It's really just a simple CONCATENATE script to generate a stable hyperlink on the NOAA ERMA website, so I don't have to wait for the Civilian Air Patrol website to load, only to have it download 20 imagines of 10MB photos onto my little laptop when it does work.   

  
I have been sharing the CAP Viewer website, only to have people tell me that it doesn't work.  

  
Addresses can be fudged, each photo has 6 city blocks.  Right now, a human has to geocode the addresses into a lat and long  (decimal degrees).  NOAA makes its ERMA site with stable lat longs in the URL, like Google does, so you can use the Decimal Degrees to make a new URL.  I like Zoom level 16, how about you?
