The [Cartosco.pe](http://Cartosco.pe) Project is an amazing resource for creating citizen science imagery ID projects after a disaster.

Now, they have created a simple tool to help spreadsheet GIS users to answer the question--

Did the National Geodetic Survey fly over my points of interest in this Storm (Inside the United States)?

Check out NGS Quick Maps!

[https://cartosco.pe/ngs\_quick\_maps/](https://cartosco.pe/ngs_quick_maps/)

First, **Pick** a recent storm that has storm imagery on

[https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/](https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/)

Next, **upload** a .csv of your Points of Interest. Maybe there's just one.

Upload your own .csv: (Columns must be name,latitude,longitude in decimal degrees)

Third, **click** "Update Markers" to draw your points on the photos.

Lastly, you can determine how many of your points have a photo! Click "**Filter** Locations" and [Cartosco.pe](http://Cartosco.pe) will generate a new .csv for you! Handy!
