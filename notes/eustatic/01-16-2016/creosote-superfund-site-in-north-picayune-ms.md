###What I want to do

For the monthly event for organizers, Dan took us out around Picayune.  We mapped two sites, the <a href="https://goo.gl/JPlSnS">Creosote Plant</a> that has been deemed a superfund site; and a controversial <a href="https://goo.gl/MTK7DL">sand drying site</a> on Highway 11. 

###My attempt and results

tori, luc, coriander, diana, david, dan B, scott, stevie (and tbear) were out to flly the balloon.  David, Scott, Coriander, Stevie, Diana, and Dan B sat around at the PJ's afterward to work in mapknitter. We even got stuck in a charming Picayune carnival parade!  woo!

The first attempt flew over the neighborhood, the second attempt was from the north entrance.

<br>
there were also Chorus Frogs north of the sand drying site, an indication that there's a bit of wetland nearby. 

###Questions and next steps

###Why I'm interested

I've heard about these sites from residents, but now i have a much better idea of what they are, and who might be affected by them, merely by situating them in a landscape.
