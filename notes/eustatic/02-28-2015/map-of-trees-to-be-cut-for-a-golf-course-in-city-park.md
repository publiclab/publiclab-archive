###What I want to do

use mapknitter to help people locate the trees that are slated to be destroyed for the (money losing, fun-killing) golf course in city park.  I'd like to hold a funeral for the trees, some of which are very old.  I'd like to collect the tree ring cores/ disks to demonstrate the age of oak trees.

###My attempt and results

i couldn't get the annotation tool to work in windows 8 with chrome. I tried to use the old annotation tool and the new tool.  i should try in firefox.

###Questions and next steps

If we have to pay for rich people to play golf, we should at least be able to know everything about our trees, since they have to die.  for golf.
