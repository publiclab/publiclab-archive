###What I want to do

Help the Nature Center raise money for forest restoration. The Nature Center is where I first learned about Louisiana's Wetlands and FEMA / Audubon are moving foward with restoring the center after a long delay.

###My attempt and results

Amy made a map for us to digitize, and made it in MS paint.

###Questions and next steps

Can Mapknitter help cash-strapped, community based restoration projects with technical documentation.

###Why I'm interested
