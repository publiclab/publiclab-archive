Here's a video of Don at I at 3am, when a lot of progress on the "Dribble", a Riffle for a depth sensor.

This is the Riffle [arduino + microSD + battery + storage battery] + 555 + capacitance wire inside of a stand pipe.

By stand pipe I mean a 3' length of 3" ABS chopped with a chop saw and drilled out, 8 intake holes in the bottom, 8 air outflow holes up top.

###Questions and next steps

This is an update from when Don visited last time, when Lauren Sullivan made many videos on the Riffle.
