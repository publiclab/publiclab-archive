in 15 minutes, gave a rationale for kite photography and demonstrated kite, picavet rig, and obtained a monitoring photo of an erosion control project undertaken by weeks bay foundation.

Also put Becki's camera into the saltwater, because of the method of attachment of the tail to the cheap Delta Coyne kite.

in this case, the target project is visible from shore.  It's a "christmas tree" style shoreline erosion structure.  Aerial photography can monitor the state of the structure, the trees (which normally rot away in a year or so), and the condition of the shore behind it.

In this shot, though it is oblique, we can count the number of holding cells that are full, the number empty, and number in disrepair.

last photo before loss of camera


The Kite and camera rig were retrieved easily, but the camera was waterlogged for aobut 1 minute in brackish water. 

Later flight of Dazzle Delta went swimmingly, although there was no camera, and few witnesses. of course.
