###What I want to do

Here are some videos documenting Lauren Sullivan, Don Blair, and Scott Eustis (with a head cold) learning and teaching and building on arduinos and breadboards and scribbling things on a whiteboard. 

Kenny came around and helped out by listening to our crazy talk about doodads and gizmos. Thanks, Kenny.

####Topics covered:


[![sullivan_temp_prototyping.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/086/medium/sullivan_temp_prototyping.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/086/original/sullivan_temp_prototyping.png)


What's a bioindicator?
basic arduino and breadboard stuff
why the riffle --why a low cost water monitor with qualitative feedback
what's the point? Why open source?
riffle, sniffle, coqui, nymph, tadpole, odonate, ([Lolliguncula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolliguncula_brevis)?)
why do we want to measure depth?  Why do we want to measure depth in new orleans?

####background on depth
Depth measurements based on Dan Beavers' insights into capacitance, and all the physics and discussion on this website, By Nathan Hurst, Stevie Cummings, Ken Sheridan, Darryl, and Andy Bartram

What can a nymph tell us about our water, or what can the riffle tell us?

###Questions and next steps

What kinds of videos could be done for Science TV?

What would Nathan Do?
