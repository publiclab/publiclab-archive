# Green Slice:  shots from kite lesson in Mr Morton's class

no wind today; will try again in a few weeks.  

tried three kinds of deltas--box, dazzle, and Dan's kite from winter camp.

had rig set up, but lack of wind kept us grounded--should have flown the balloon. 

still, the kids loved it when i ran with the kite.  they ran to catch it.
