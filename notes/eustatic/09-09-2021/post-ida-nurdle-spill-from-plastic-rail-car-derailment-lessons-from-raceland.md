Following up on Plastic in NRC data:  

[https://publiclab.org/notes/eustatic/09-23-2020/querying-the-us-national-response-center-s-data-for-reports-of-plastic-to-the-us-coast-guard-with-skytruth-org](https://publiclab.org/notes/eustatic/09-23-2020/querying-the-us-national-response-center-s-data-for-reports-of-plastic-to-the-us-coast-guard-with-skytruth-org)  

  
I have deepened my understanding of where to find information on plastic spilled during train derailments and incidents, after local residents asked me to investigate a recent, post-Ida derailment.   

  
Within the NRC tables, there is a "DERAILED\_UNITS" tab that has a "CAR\_CONTENT" field

The DERAILED\_UNITS  --\> CAR\_CONTENT  has the "plastic"  label 

  
This photo was taken by Civilian Air Patrol, who is flying in support of FEMA.

SkyTruth Analysis  
Lat/Long: 29.747222, -90.609444 (Explicit) [![](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/GPX8rq2ax8cA-_K9NoEa-KrKt9aMHNBx6nl6ismoptzWEcKbDz9odZ0Z5y9x72VV8Po1UFGqimjwnfSab001U2kLXig3GWsK=s0-d-e1-ft#https://alerts.skytruth.org/images/icons8-info-20.png)](https://www.skytruth.org/section/alerts-geocoding/)  
Report DescriptionCALLER IS REPORTING THAT FOUR CARS DERAILED FROM A FREIGHT TRAIN ON A PASSENGER TRAIN LINE. THE CAUSE IS UNKNOWN. DOUBLE MAIN TRACK IS CLOSED. NO DELAYS TO PASSENGER SERVICES.

  
See attached for a large nurdle spill into wetlands in lafourche parish after Ida.

  
The Release of Plastic is considered a "Railroad Non-Release", although this waterway is connected to the Lake Boeuf Wildlife Management Area.  

  
Within the NRC tables, there is a "DERAILED\_UNITS" tab that has a "CAR\_CONTENT" field

The DERAILED\_UNITS  --\> CAR\_CONTENT  has the "plastic"  label  for these four cars, in incident 131 5801, which have visibly spilled plastics.  

  
  

| SEQNOS| TRAIN_NAME_NUMBER| CAR_NUMBER| CAR_CONTENT| POSITION_IN_TRAIN| DERAILED_TYPE|
| 1315801| HLALNSI1-02| FINX10809| PLASTIC| | CAR|
| 1315801| HLALNSI1-02| FINX50062| PLASTIC| | CAR|
| 1315801| HLALNSI1-02| CEFX54545| PLASTIC| | CAR|
| 1315801| HLALNSI1-02| CBFX470967| PLASTIC| | CAR|

  
  
I can work on review a history of NRC incidents, and thus locations with this "CAR\_CONTENT" = 'PLASTIC'  

  
It would also be interesting to see, by block group, or county, which block groups or counties have the largest number of PLASTIC car incidents per mile of railroad.
