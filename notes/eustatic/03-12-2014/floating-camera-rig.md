###What I want to do

I want to be able to recover the memory when the camera gets wet from flying over wetlands, and well, falling into the water for various unforeseen or foreseen reasons. 
<br>
Shannon and I have dipped an A490 into Lake Pontchartrain (8ppt), and the camera survived.<br>
I have dunked a Canon into Weeks' Bay (15 ppt salt) , and the camera died, but the memory lived.<br>
I have lost one camera in Barataria Bay, which was a total loss --MIA<br>
And during kite pilot training, we dragged a camera through Grand Isle Sound, for a camera and card death in 25 ppt saltwater. <br><br>

###My attempt and results
How about  a faucet cover? it's the appropriate size and shape, minimal cost at $2, and easy to sculpt.<br>

it's very light<br>

It can be tied akin to the usual Soda Bottle Rig method, once sculpted with appropriate holes<br>

how does it work?  you decide.<br>
As a reminder to the easily traumatized, the camera is still going to get wet, and possibly die, especially in brackish or saline waters. The memory may even be killed by saltwater, depending on its manufacture and conditions of recovery.<br><br>
(no operational cameras were soaked in this brief experiment, only a loyal unit which had previously expired, with batteries for accurate weight.)<br><br>

This wasn't exactly terminal velocity.

###Questions and next steps

I've flown a version of this already, and modified it by adding a ring of gaff tape around the edge, for some additional structure.  It worked swimmingly.

I also added a couple slits in the bottom to secure the rubber band harness better.  Solid as a rock--and, in fact, I now much prefer this to the Soda Bottle Rig, even for flights over land. 

I should post my modification to the Lippincott harness. i added more rubber bands, so that the camera will almost never tilt from line turbulence.
