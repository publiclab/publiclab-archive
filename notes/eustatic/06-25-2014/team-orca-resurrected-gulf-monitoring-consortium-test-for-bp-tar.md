#Draft
##Reflections on the Alpha Oil Testing Kit
[to be continued]

Team Orca has rolled over.  Eustis, Henderson, Jen (adios), Kearney (out of pocket).

GMC has a need for field testing for oil.  
1) is this Oil?  the smell test is great, but the media wants visuals. <br><br>

2) Is this BP's Oil?  This will require some fingerprinting and spectralworkbench. This is a very tough question and the pros like Ed Overton at LSU, are having some trouble doing this as time passes. Can we make things work in field conditions?<br><br>

[this is part one, non spectrometer results, appropriate for field]

###What was tested

<5mW vs <1000,W UV laser<br>
--no difference to "eyeball" , both same freq

Control Mineral Oil and Coal Dust in Mineral Oil<br>
 So here we show the mineral oil, mineral oil with coal dust (shows the laser with minimal fluoresce) and Grand Isle Coffee 100x (laser stopped before olive oil)<br>

West Bay, TX after the Kirby Y spill

Bay Batiste water (no mineral oil except at top of vial)<br>

<br>
[When, where, what]<br>
Now we know that unknown oil isn't veggie oil, and is more likely crude.  but BP crude?  Corexit?


###Things that went well
like the rubber pipetters

mineral oil container less spilly and gross than commerical mineral oil ("top best" or some such)

nice small cuvettes for samples, but we defaulted to 30ml [Barnes droppers](http://www.hometrainingtools.com/bottle-barnes-dropper-30-ml/p/CE-BTBAR30/) for cuvettes

###Challenges encountered

need oily proof labels, like painters tape, avery labels would not stick.

tyvek tape sticks!

###Suggestions to improve the tool
