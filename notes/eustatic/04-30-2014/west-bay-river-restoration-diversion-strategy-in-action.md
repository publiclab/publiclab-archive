###What I want to do

I want to document a river restoration project in the birdfoot delta for Gulf Monitoring Consortium, Alex Ameen, and the RESTOREDelta campaign folks.

###My attempt and results

GRN flight, post Karen Oct 2013. Passenger Pigeon.  Canon 7D with polarized lens.
Very clear day.

###Questions and next steps

Links are up on the Mapknitters Carto Collective [document](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B32DNGN8pX_XSDQ2NXEzVXJJZXM&usp=sharing)

Have to make a [map](https://mapknitter.org/maps/west-bay).

###Why I'm interested

so much heat over diversions, so little light.
