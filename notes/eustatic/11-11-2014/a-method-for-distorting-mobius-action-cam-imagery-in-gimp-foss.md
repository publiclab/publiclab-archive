###What I want to do

Make Mapknitter maps with infragram and another mobius (so light!)

So Mat suggested a method of distorting graph paper until it looked right. 

Chris Fastie has laid out the limitations of infragram maps --the edges need to be cropped

I think GIMP crops edges.

I want to use this because I'm too poor for photoshop, and freedom rules. 

###My attempt and results

There are two "Lens Distortion" filters in GIMP

Filters -> Distort -> Lens Distortion

"Main" and "Edge"

Here is the original image

Main -40

###Questions and next steps

What do people think?

Here's a shoreline map with no distortion, -34, and -41 5.
