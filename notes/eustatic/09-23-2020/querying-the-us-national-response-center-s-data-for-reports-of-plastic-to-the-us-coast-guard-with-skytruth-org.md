As part of the Gulf Monitoring Consortium, Skytruth offers their alerts system to synthesize an unwieldy database for a very accessible reporting system.

  
Here's a map of reports of "Plastic" to the USCG, USA, National Response Center, courtesy of Skytruth and the Gulf Monitoring Consortium :: 

http://alerts.skytruth.org/issue/186-plastic

  
There were 2437 reports, focused on population centers and the industrial ocean on the Gulf Coast.   1126 (46%) reports are from the Gulf States, South of Jackson, Mississippi ("US Gulf Coast").

These are downloadable as a kml or csv file format.

  
These are not all microplastics, but "burning plastic smell," and "pellets", and even "nurdles", as well as "plastic drum"s that hold other materials, like oil. 

  
"plastic"  1126 of 2437    48%     US Gulf Coast

"pellet"    35 of 199         17.5%     US Gulf Coast

"nurdle"  1 of 1                100% US Gulf Coast  (Chalmette, resident report)  

  
"plastic"  610 of 2437   25%      TX Coast   545 reports in Point Comfort!  Formosa "Plastics"

"pellet"    5 of 199        2.5%    TX Coast

"nurdle"   0 of 1            0% TX Coast

How does this coincide with the nurdle patrol data?

**How does this represent the lack of attention to the issue from government agencies?

As advocates, we encourage residents to report to NRC, since the number, 1 800 424 8802, is an accessible technology to most, and can create jobs, via clean up work. 

  
Here are reports related to the CMA CMG Bianca event in New Orleans from TS Marco. 

The First report does not contain any of these keywords.
