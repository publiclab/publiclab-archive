The boys at Docville gifted us three lotus seeds to grow (see their greenhouse above).  Initially, we prepared three jars with potting soil, hoping to speed up the process.  this was ill conceived. seeds should be scarred, then put in water first.

(These jars should just be full of non-chlorinated water instead)  

  
We scarred the seeds with a paring knife, cutting off the remnant petiole(?), or attachment point for the seed.

We should have used a potato peeler to really open up the seed coat all over.  

  
  
  
Out of three, one Lotus has spouted. and now, transplanted into soil.
