We flew an old school Canon and balloon rig, like in the glory days of 2010, in the still heat of Bayou Bienvenue. except we also flew a Canmore locator to get lat long data. It was hot. I got stung by wasps. no limbs were lost to the mama gator on the far side. Hundreds of mullet were jumping in the six inch to two foot water depth. Liz had never seen a fish jump, which blew my mind. Happy, Roland, Joe, Stevie, Scott, Liz.

flight, 11am - 12:42, very long. too long, we got overexposed, but the photos are good. Camera ran like a clock the entire flight. Some of best work came in the beginning, the balloon hit a gust of wind at a few hundred feet, then we had to reel it in to maintain target position. Would like to return to check up on tallow spread into the SWB restoration cells to the east.

The bullrush planting along the east-west road, that we documented in the Urban Water series, is undergoing a kind of succession to willow trees on the high end and hyacinth on the low end. i have never seen bullrush get outcompeted.![image description](/i/26320.jpg "c_IMG_3166.JPG")

The blooms of hyacinth and duckweed, we caught that on camera. Mapknitter to come, enjoy
