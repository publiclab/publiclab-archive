Chalmette smells.  It's frustrating.  

  
In the interest of figuring out how to make life interesting when you have to smell the sulfur coming from the refineries, I tried to see if I could smell the odor along the two highways, in different locations. 

  
Can I figure out which of the plants is having the issues?  Valero (Murphy), PBF Chalmette (Exxon Chalmette Refinery) and Rain CII Carbon are the ones that I suspect.

  
From ChemPlants.com::

Rain CII Carbon Chalmette (Kaiser) Chalmette LA 700 Coke Plant Rd, Chalmette, LA 70043 29.9376901 -89.9782969

Chalmette Refining (ExxonMobil) Chalmette LA 520 W St Bernard Hwy, Chalmette, LA 70043 29.9253663 -89.960817

Valero (Murphy) Meraux LA 2500 E St Bernard Hwy, Meraux, LA 70075 29.932668,-89.9537378 

  
  
On April 23rd, 2020, I was driving to the coast.  I smelled sulphur on Judge Perez Dr, and pulled over.   I recorded the time, 1145, and the intersection, Judge Perez and Plaza. I took a right turn, to see if I smelled the smell on Plaza, but I lost the odor.  So I turned back on St Bernard Hwy, and headed west until I caught wind again, this time at Victor and St Bernard Hwy. 

  
Presumably, this makes something of a line to the source. It seems like it's not Valero, anyway.  ![image description](/i/41149.jpg "Chalmette_odor.jpg")

  
  
This only added 15 minutes to my drive.  Google says that it could take as little as 8 minutes. 

This isn't much, but I tried to make this interesting without taking a lot of time. two points is better than one!
