###What I want to do

Re-post a blog from healthygulf.org encouraging participation in a 'classic' citizen-science project, the North American Amphibian Monitoring Program.

The [Louisiana Master Naturalists](http://www.louisianamasternaturalistgno.org/workshops.html) are re-invigorating these citizen-science surveys as part of the annual Continuing Education and volunteer hours required for state certification.

Public Lab has worked with LA Master Naturalists in the past, in particular, collaboration in the EPA urban waters program counts toward the required LMN-GNO volunteer hours.

###My attempt and results

This January, I traveled to the ditches of Plaquemines and St Bernard to hear the glorious choruses of winter frogs with the [Louisiana Master Naturalists,](http://www.louisianamasternaturalistgno.org/workshops.html) as part of the [North American Amphibian Monitoring Program](https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/naamp/).  Among elders, specialists, and interested naturalists with ears, we silently stood in the shoulder of highway 46 and listened for the breeding chorus of _Pseudacris fouquettei_,  [The Cajun Chorus Frog](http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/1216580). 

I'm sure we looked funny, standing still in the dark as cars passed. But our ears were working to find the calls of these little beauties. We also heard the roar of engines moving past, all part of the sonic environment of St Bernard, and something that doesn't seem to bother the raucous frogs.

We also heard the Peep! of "Spring" Peepers (_Pseudacris crucifer_ ) and the [stretched-rubber song ](https://soundcloud.com/scott-eustis/150119-184533-southern-leopard-at-plaquemines-1-2015)of Southern Leopard Frogs.

It may seem silly to stand on the roadside at night, but the night sounds are ours as Louisiana citizens.  What will happen to the frogs should the waters be polluted or salted? Where do they evacuate? Article IX of the Louisiana Constitution protects and replenishes the esthetic quality of the environment--and so the frogs are protected as they are singing for their succor. At least the judges have to listen to the frogs--will our legislature? Will the state act to protect and restore the Central Wetland homes of these creatures? Are they, like, us, only here for as long as paradise holds out? 

Regardless, paradise is here, now; if we are listening.
