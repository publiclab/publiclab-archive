# [draft]Intro to Aerial Photo interpretation of wetland class notes

This is the first of two classes on aerial photography interpretation.

This class was an introduction to the basics of aerial photography, and listed and briefly discussed the many aspects of photography to consider when looking at a photograph. 

Multi-spectral and hyperspectral data, and algorithms used to interpret them were discussed, but the focus of this workshop was to develop the framework necessary for "cognitive" human interpretation of aerial photography, particularly Color Infrared Photography (CIR), and how to plan and interpret site visits as well. 

At the end of the class, teams delineated wetland types using a self-generated wetland classification system, and had to defend their newly created classification system based upon a suite of characters within the photograph, from the site visits, and using ancillary information.
