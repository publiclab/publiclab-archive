Today, Shannon and Scott placed 4 x 8 = 32 H2S test strips in a degraded wetland under pump in Orleans Parish, LA. 

We attempted to deploy a balloon, but it popped and with it went our onsite Helium supply. 

4 of the 8 pvc staffs were short (~4'), and 4 tall (~6'), to get a range of distances from the ground.  Because the ground all around is the source, the circular pattern was scrapped for now.  

Within each canister pair, different types of openings were made.  These will be described in an addendum.  There was a single nail-hole canister within every pair.  some pairs had their caps removed, with a small piece of ducttape to prevent the test strip from falling out;  other pairs had three nail holes punched in their caps.

Scott will make a return visit during the week.  Retrieval will begin at S 08, as the holes were made starting at S 08, and after 15 minutes, holes were completed in S 01.  

Retrieval will include taping over the holes tightly (or replacement of caps) with black Gaffe tape, placement in box for mailing to their destination.

Video forthcoming.
