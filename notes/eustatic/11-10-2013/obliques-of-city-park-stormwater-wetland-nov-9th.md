###What I want to do

Scott and Matt P were hanging out in City Park, because the Bayou St John planting was cancelled. Scott had his car full of Publiclab gear from yesterday's REF planting in the Birdfoot
<br>
Scott wanted to map the city park stormwater wetland in order to show it on google earth.  New Orleans needs to adopt this mehtod of stormwater retention for the sake of its carbon footprint, to slow its subsidence, and to create a more beautilful city in a wetland, so that New Orleanians can never forget that they are precariously surrounded by water, but that is a wonderful thing.

###My attempt and results

Kite:  9ft dazzle delta
rig:  RC picavet from public lab
camera: canon 1400 pink with knot banded and taped down on continuous fire
<br>
We activated the RC rig to get some nice obliques, but couldn't get the angle of the kite high enough to manuver among the park's gorgeous trees, in order to get a map of the wetland area
<br>
had we had more time, we could have "charged" the kite and rig upwards, by running back and forth with the kite, across the soccer field--the way that scott mapped the bayou st john wetland project the other week.  
<br>
the wind was <5mph, enough to hold the delta aloft, and enough to keep the rig up while we were running, but not enough to get the rig up high enough to avoid collisions with people using the park.  

location:  29.992129,-90.090276  (note that this wetland has no plants in current GE photos)

###Questions and next steps

Scott should write up how to use a runway to lift a big delta kite and rig in low wind. 
<br>
Matt P was a big fan of getting the carp pole to map this site, instead of a balloon or kite.
