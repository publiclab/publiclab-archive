###What I want to do

West Bay was one of the original Mississippi River Delta Restoration projects, if not the first one governments attempted on purpose.  It's had a storied [opposition](http://155.76.244.234/lcast/pdfs/09mar/Duffy%20-%20Presentation%20on%20West%20Bay%20Diversion.pdf) and [history](http://lacoast.gov/new/Projects/Info.aspx?num=mr-03).  For [all of that history](http://lacoast.gov/reports/project/West%20Bay%20Report.pdf), it has even more to teach coastal restoration scientists and [advocates](http://vanishingparadise.org/updates/fall-fishing-in-the-west-bay-diversion/).

Can the Delta win against the shipping industry? Can Louisiana maintain its integrity and remain the conduit through which the United States dumps its waste and floats its exports?

For[ hi altittude](http://publiclab.org/notes/gonzoearth/03-29-2014/mapping-10km2) mapping of emerging islands of the [West Bay Diversion](http://publiclab.org/notes/eustatic/04-30-2014/west-bay-river-restoration-diversion-strategy-in-action), i want to create a photo series of the public photography available.  

the screen shots were taken from LA DNR SONRIS GIS at <br>
http://sonris-www.dnr.state.la.us/gis/agsweb/IE/JSViewer/index.html?TemplateID=181
<br>

DNR's slippy map is nice, but their Metadata is crud. Some of these data layers are restricted for state of LA use.

###Next

find a bounding box to target to make data requests.

###Why I'm interested

hopeful story in Louisiana

animated gif of land v water?

dredge and river working together with community input into government restoration

I'm more interested in islands that emerge than islands that are built with the dredge, although it will be very interesting to see which kinds of land last longer in river Floods and Hurricanes, and which plants grow on which islands.
