During the [Open hour on COP21](https://youtu.be/KkkA9s3YSIw?t=8m48s), there was mention of the term "Carbon Bomb" and discussion of an EcoFys report ("Point of No Return") on 14 industrial projects most likely (in 2013) to disrupt the Climate by increasing industrial carbon emissions by 2020--in some cases, the carbon emissions potential for any one of the projects exceeds the carbon budget for the entire planet (565 MT by 2015, according to Carbon Tracker).

This report informs much climate activism, especially from Greenpeace. Commissioned by Greenpeace, it attempts to rank the most dangerous fossil-fuel projects currently being planned. The metric is simple: how many additional tons of CO2 the project will emit by 2020. (See the report for more on methodology.)

###Qua the Gulf Coast --US's island nation, internally colonized

Louisiana needs "1.5 to survive" --the state is already experiencing population dislocation. Louisiana is also politically dominated by companies involved with several of the projects. The US is involved with 5 of the projects. The supply chains of these projects touch Louisiana and Texas.

GOM Offshore Directly. Here's how it ranks among a dirty dozen of climate wrecking projects:<br><br>

Chinaâ€™s Western provinces / Coal mining expansion / 1,400<br>
Australia / Coal export expansion / 760<br>
Arctic / Drilling for oil and gas / 520  ** (dead 2015?) **<br>
Indonesia / Coal export expansion / 460<br>
**5. United States / Coal export expansion / 420  (limited in 2015)**<br>
Canada / **Tar sands oil** / 420 <br>( Oil trains through wetlands in Pass Manchac, Valero Refinery in NORCO, waste processing at Shell / IMTT, waste Pet Coke goes to IMT and UBT )<br>
Iraq / Oil drilling / 420<br>
**8. Gulf of Mexico / Deepwater oil drilling / 350**<br>
Brazil / Deepwater oil drilling (pre-salt) / 330<br>
Kazakhstan / Oil drilling / 290<br>
**11. United States / Shale gas / 280**<br>
Africa / Gas drilling / 260<br>
Caspian Sea / Gas drilling / 240<br>
Venezuela / **Tar sands oil** / 190 (see other tar sands)<br>
