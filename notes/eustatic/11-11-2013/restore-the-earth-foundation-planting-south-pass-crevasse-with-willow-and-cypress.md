###What I want to do
<br>
in one hour, document the day-long planting conducted with Restore the Earth Foundation and LDWF of a Crevasse project in South Pass, LA.   
<br>
This site had been suggested for DredgeFest imagery for LA 2014 by Lauren Sullivan and Andy Nyman.  
<br>
Time was limited.  I didn't finish walking over to the western site before i was summoned back to the boat.  Allow more than 90 minutes for photography, is the lesson there. <br>

This will result in a map, eventually, of some very dynamic land-building, in very high resolution.  We also captured a single event.<br>

I'm going to map this one myself, as a promise to REF

###My attempt and results

Kite:  Little Bear
Rig:  RC Picavet
Camera: Canon 1400 with trigger taped down
wind varied from 10-15 mph, but at a certain elevation, the kite would not climb.

Gulf Restoration Network and Public Lab.  This work may appear at DredgeFest Louisiana Jan 17 and on Google Earth in the coming months. <br>

All told, the site was 600m long, but I don't know if the site was planted as planned. So it may be much shorter. <br>

i'm unsure about my coverage of the western edge of the site, since the boat left with my kite before i could map it and i ran out of time...but i have about 1000 more photos to go through, i know i got at least a partial rendering. I do think that the site is not as extensive as the plan states.  I know that the 5 gal cypress were planted more in the "back," because  I was in charge of that planting team.  I could probably annotate these particular 25 trees, since Royal team planted them with care.  

Colored stakes used to guide the planting are indeed visible in the photos--there was a strip of the planting plan, that if retrieved could provide a reference.  But I think i washed mine in the washer.

###Questions and next steps

Make a map.  give to Google.  Print for DredgeFest LA
