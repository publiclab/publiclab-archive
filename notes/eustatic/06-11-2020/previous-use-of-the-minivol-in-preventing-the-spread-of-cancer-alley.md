Working with Global Community Monitor, HealthyGulf (nee GRN), Louisiana Environmental Action Network, and Sierra Club enabled residents to prove that their complaints about air quality in Plaquemines Parish had merit. This work was part of the Clean Gulf Commerce Coalition with Public Citizen in Texas.

HealthyGulf was discussing with residents why a proposed coal terminal would have severe impacts to coastal wetlands necessary for Louisiana's survival.

Residents responded with complaints about the dust from existing coal terminals and grain terminals along HWY 23 and the Mississippi River.

Rather than use the Bucket, it was determined that the MiniVol sampler would be an appropriate tool.

We worked together to devise a sampling plan.

Eventually, a press release with the data got a hit in the regional press. Here's what was reported.

[Plaquemines air testing finds potential health concerns near coal terminals Benjamin Alexander-Bloch, NOLA.com JAN 17, 2014](https://www.nola.com/news/environment/article_18215fdd-e8b6-567c-ab27-845419cbee98.html)

Testing results show that air near the International Marine Terminal in Port Sulphur showed signs of elevated fine particulate matter, known as PM-10, that could potentially cause health concerns to sensitive people if there was long-term exposure.

During one 24-hour period in September, PM-10 levels of 30.1 micrograms per cubic meter of air (ug/m3) were monitored.

The World Health Organization states that PM-10 levels of more than 20 ug/m3 are unhealthy, with one World Health Organization study in 2006 stating that 13 Italian cities averaged 8,220 deaths a year because of average PM-10 concentrations above 20 ug/m3\.

Still, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets the national annual air quality standard for PM-10 at 50 ug/m3 and the daily concentration at 150 Âµg/m3, so the peaks in Plaquemines' air quality measured in the fall of 2013 did not rise above national standards.

But various environmental group workers said the results show that additional coal terminals in the community should not be considered.\*\*

Company representatives reset the MiniVol while it was taking samples. They came up on the porch, trespassing to confound the sensor. Installation of these monitors should keep the personal security of residents in mind. Nevertheless, they couldn't stop most of the effort.

In particular, legal resources to keep company representatives off private property are not equally distributed.

Easter 2013, International Marine Terminal

Although residents were highly aware of the pollution, it took quantified, professional sampling for agencies to take the pollution seriously. Agency heads called and demanded to see all of our data, even after we had published everything in the regional paper. More white communities up the river began to see the issues that coastal residents were struggling with.

Thanks to Plaquemines residents and Global Community Monitor for keeping the air clean in District 7, and throughout the Westbank.
