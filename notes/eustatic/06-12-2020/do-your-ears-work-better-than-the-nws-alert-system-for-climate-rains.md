timeline for June 10th climate rain

I was awoken around 7:15, it was loud. sound can predict rain intensity. I don't think i thought that must, this was more an emotional reaction.

The Rain is over, but if you live near a pump, flood waters may still rise! document how long it takes your street to drain on [https://www.iseechange.org/](https://www.iseechange.org/?fbclid=IwAR1LB2CMJ79v0BaOur3EpZODQmCWK7y7IzRZeHVWm9EZpT3e3SS1s6bYxhc)

**at 9:24AM, CMAS** alerts us to flash flooding in Orleans Parish : NWS: FLASH FLOOD WARNING this area til 10:45 AM CDT. Avoid flooded areas

Slow no Wake! If you are out driving, consider how your wake may put water into other people's cars, if they are parked on the street. Save your neighbors a trip to the wet vac.

Although the water had started to drain by 9, by 9:38, with this second, additional shower, the water is back up over my street. even though the big pulse of Climate rain is over, the water will continue to slosh around in the system for a couple of hours. post the flooding duration near you with ISeeChange, and help us learn how the City drains in a Climate Rain

at 10:24 [(?) T4 goes down ?](https://www.nola.com/news/healthcare_hospitals/article_3f6edb4a-a9d7-11ea-abf1-2791082490e9.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=user-share&fbclid=IwAR1KugmEvQNP303I-xNplbYFNjDcRP0VRpdXJUs4IZnvIBN9pAEWGN8udwY) the news doesn't say when T4 went down

"Councilman Jared Brossett, pointing to a S&WB policy that generators should be on standby, asked why they hadn't been turned on after a flash flood warning was issued an hour before the turbine shut down."

at 10:45, there was another peak in the flood waters on my street, they started to go down.

**at 11:46, NOLA Ready **posted: Street Flooding continues in New ORleans. DO not drive through water on the road! Call 911 to report major flooding.**[Streetwise.nola.gov](http://Streetwise.nola.gov)**

at noon, there was another peak in the flood waters on my street

I feel like i can see the water slosh toward the lake, in the 311 calls, 9:30am vs 1:30pm. my street is still pretty flooded out by uno, but London Ave canal has been moving with swiftness for hours. This is just way too much water for the system.![image description](/i/39763.png "streetwise_calls_911_10_june_2020.png")
