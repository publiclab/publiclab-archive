##Event details

When, where, what
7am Wed 2nd October, Kite Mapping of wetlands restoration project in Jeff Parish, off the Bonnabel Boat Launch

##Background

[Scott Eustis](scott.eustis@organizers.publiclab.org) and Lily Zhou of Jefferson Parish Environmental Affairs will map a small wetlands restoration project at the Bonnabel Boat launch (~30.021333, -90.141241), in progress. 

If construction is slow or winds unfavorable, we may not get to take a map today, so valuable helium will be spared, and the Little Bear kite will be our primary mapping tool.

The rig will be a single or double soda bottle rig with A490s, dual if winds are strong enough. 

call Scott at 5o4 484 9five99 if you want a ride
