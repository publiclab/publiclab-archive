###What I want to do

re-make the faucet cover rig for infragram, using the same kind of parts.

###My attempt and results

Here, we show the knots that keep the camera snugly in the unit.  a490s are a bit bulkier than the 1400s we sometimes use.  It's thought that that makes a more snug fit, resistant to changing the camera's orientation while in a bumpy flight. <br>

It weighs .74kg fully loaded with 2 Canon a490s (batteries and chips included.
 
###Questions and next steps



###Why I'm interested

I would like to map wetlands in infragram.  so far, i only have the kind of IR camera that was hacked with an exposed piece of film.  we'll see how it works.
