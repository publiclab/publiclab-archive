###What I want to do

Jordan Macha and Scott Eustis were messing around with kites in St Charles and Orleans Parishes.   Jordan had just bought a Delta Conyne.  Previous notes from Mat Lippincott and [Gomberg Kites Website](http://www.gombergkites.com/stick.html) suggested that this kind of kite would be a good option for doubling up kites--spaced ten feet apart.

On the Gulf Coast, wind is often low and erratic, gusting and switching direction.  Anything we can do to figure out how to fly on low wind days would save money and time.

###My attempt and results

We used a falcon delta ("little bear") and this sweet new DC. 

Things were pretty gusty on Saturday when we attempted this.  At first, no swivel was used.  The picture was taken when there wasn't a swivel on the line. This was the best result.  but the DC kite soon "fell and flipped" over the main line.  There wasn't much wind, so the weight of the kite (and well, probably the hesitation of the operator to pull the kite out of the flip with increased tension) the weight of the kite caused the final kite to fall.

We added a swivel, thinking this would help the DC remain independent of twists in the main line, but alas, "fall and flip."  I think this was more a factor of the lack of wind than anything, tho.

###Questions and next steps

Gusty winds hurt your chances.  if the final kite in the  train is pulling, but the second kite isn't, the second kite (the DC in this scenario) can "fall and flip" over the line.  at that point, the second kite is lifting downward against the lift of the final kite. 

On the Gomberg site, there's a graphic for a setup for the swallow kites that allows for **Independent Tethering**  akin to trot lines on a single line. NOTE:  swivels EVERYWHERE--including double swivels at the Y-joints?  what is a "bead"?
