Serena from GNO Pellet Clean Up developed a method for filtering hundreds of thousands of pellets from river sand and debris.

We've been focused on cleaning the lower Mississippi River beaches as long as the river is low.  CDA CMG Bianca spilled a container, or 990 bags, of Dow Polyethylene pellets on August 2nd, 2020\.  But hundreds of thousands of pellets still litter the beaches as of this past saturday , Oct 31st.  Clean up didn't begin in earnest until citizens called the Coast Guard on August 6th, and the local newspaper began reporting the lack of clean up on August 10th.

  
Serena is a leader in the Algiers group that had conducted the most cleanup, and has found a great device for sorting pellets from sand. 

  
We've been wondering a source for this box, because it's been very useful for sorting new pellets from sand. Older pellets, which get smaller, do fall through, but most or all of the sand moves very quickly through the mesh, and the new, Dow Polyethylene pellets stay in the box. 

  
We found a shallower version of the box (BOAXEL Mesh basket) we have on the Ikea site, we'll see if this works the same once we order one.

sweeping the river tide line, there's also a lot of coarse material  (largely driftwood and willow branches and leaves) ![image description](/i/41474.jpg "sweeping_the_tide_line__50558954538_2f10556a81_b.jpg")

  
  
In ten minutes, we collected many many nurdles, just using three brooms and dustpans. Sweeping the beach, and filtering the dustpan through the mesh box. 

  
Still working on counts, will update this note.
