I was so happy with getting spectra using standard desktop package that I wanted to go all in and build a desktop "countertop" spectrophotometer similar to what Warren built.  However, after spending a LOT of time putting things together, I find that I am not able to get any spectra with the new setup.  Please help because I'm really need the help!  I have posted some pictures and the spectra that I see...any comments would be appreciated.  Please help!!

UPDATE:  I just so happen to just place a paper between the light source and the spectrophotometer and I did see a spectra of different colors although they were very very broad.  At least it's better than just a one color spectra of purple as shown below but again, the spectra is very very broad.  I'm thinking that the light is somehow passing through the black paper with the camera inside picking up light everywhere.  I tried dimming the light without the paper in between but all I got was the purple spectra (albeit at a lower intensity).  I tried tilting the spectrophotometer at an angle to the light source and I was able to get some different colors but no matter what, I am not able to get a sharp spectra.  Is it possible that the DVD film used to scatter the light is somewhat dirty?  I did fiddle around a lot inside trying to get the wooden block to stick.  Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Past Spectras using just the kit that was ordered online (without the desktop construction using PVC)....it was somewhat successful.  However, the above desktop setup definitely did not work as one can see from the very top spectra!

I have attached two spectra (one looking at a fluorescent T8 bulb and another one using a fluorescent T8 bulb advertised as a "Grow" lamp). What do people think with regard to the spectra (ie, is this what people typically get and is there ways to make a clearer separation between the colors?)
