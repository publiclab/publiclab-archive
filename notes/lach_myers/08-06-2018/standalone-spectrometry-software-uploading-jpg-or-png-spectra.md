I'd welcome any suggestions for analysing captured spectra off-line/standalone?

I'm building a reasonably robust standalone version of the RPi/Lego spectrometer (see [https://publiclab.org/notes/lach\_myers/07-08-2018/lego-spectrometer-publiclab-design](https://publiclab.org/notes/lach_myers/07-08-2018/lego-spectrometer-publiclab-design) ) for use at my school - years 7-12 mostly. The spectral Workbench software works well, with the big advantage of allowing uploads of spectra from my Lego/RpiCam system.

I am not sure if it can be used offline, however. To my knowledge, there are two that can - Theramino Spectrometer and SpecWin. Both require webcam capture and don't allow uploads of images, I believe, so I have a bit of an impasse at present.

Once the budget allows, I will eventually set up a HDMI screen & USB keyboard so I can use the cedarlodge system [https://publiclab.org/notes/cedarlodge/03-07-2018/raspberry-pi-spectrometer-gui.](https://publiclab.org/notes/cedarlodge/03-07-2018/raspberry-pi-spectrometer-gui)

Thanks!
