So I have a microscope(the one with the webcam and all the bolts), and I followed all the instructions (flipping the lens and setting it up) and the result was that I got a blurry image with some specks on it that sometimes come into focus, but nothing else will come into focus and all that happens is that I can see the light if I shine it on the lens. Are there mistakes that I have made? How can I fix them?
