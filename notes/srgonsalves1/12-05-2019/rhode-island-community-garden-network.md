To enhance community engagement, the Community Garden Network is a comprehensive list of community farms and gardens located throughout Rhode Island. This project aims to connect people with food resources around Rhode Island.

Through the interactive map, you will find the locations of all known community gardens and farms, farmers market, chain grocery stores, food pantries, and meal sites throughout Rhode Island.
