Hi all-

I am starting my senior thesis and will be creating an automated data collection device to track root growth. The image analysis will be performed using a raspberry pi/ camera and an arduino based system to move the raspberry pi/ camera toward the plates within an incubator. Pretty excited to start my project and will be keeping updates here on my progress!
