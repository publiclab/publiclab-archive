I'm a neurosurgery resident in Turkey. We are working on a system that will measure CSF density and content in real time.

We want to measure turbidity of the otherwise clear CSF that flows through the closed yet transparent line. So that we can see if the cell count/protein content of the fluid is increasing. Would it possible for us to modify the test chamber so that rather than a rectangular cuvette, a fluid line enters the measurement chamber and exits without interruption. We are thinking of an opaque chamber that forms an "U" so it can be dark inside for the measurement?

This is the device we're using for the CSF drainage: [http://www.medtronic.me/content/dam/medtronic-com/products/neurological/critical-care/mns-duetqrg.pdf](http://www.medtronic.me/content/dam/medtronic-com/products/neurological/critical-care/mns-duetqrg.pdf "http://www.medtronic.me/content/dam/medtronic-com/products/neurological/critical-care/mns-duetqrg.pdf")

The challenge is that we can't modify the drainage device itself, it has to get noninvasive measurements.

And would it be possible to differentiate what is causing the turbidity increase? As in, can we guess whether leukocytes or the erythrocytes increasing? And can we check if the glucose or protein levels are increasing within the CSF?
