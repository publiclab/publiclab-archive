This is a workshop to introduce the Public Lab community to members of Citizens without Borders and Science has no Borders meetup groups. It the first in a series of activities on environmental monitoring. We will introduce near infrared sensing and the PL approach, including the development of tools and application.

The follow-up workshops include NIR image processing using infragram.org and discussion and calibration as well as DIY aerial mapping using kites.

Where: London, UK University College London
When: Monday 14th Nov 18:30

More information at www.sciencehasnoborder.org

###What we would like to try at this workshop

Once cameras have been converted, we will compare reflectance from halogen bulbs and growing lamps using red and blue LEDs; we will also photograph different types of indoor plants (too dark to take photos outside!)
