I would like so help in figuring out this Infragram.org mystery... here are the exact steps I took:

1) I uploaded the image of a little Daisy here in London taken by my friend John with a NIR camera (blue filter 2007):

[![IMG_1849_(800x600).jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/118/medium/IMG_1849_%28800x600%29.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/118/original/IMG_1849_%28800x600%29.jpg)

2) I uploaded the image using "NDVI for BLUE filters" > Colorized and I got this:

[![NIR_1849_basic_grey.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/119/medium/NIR_1849_basic_grey.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/119/original/NIR_1849_basic_grey.jpg)

3) Then I choose RGB analysis > Run to get the NIR original image and then I select Grey analysis > Default colormap and get this:

[![NIR_1849.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/120/medium/NIR_1849.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/120/original/NIR_1849.jpg)

4) I wonder why the Daisy is showing red and apply the formula (R-B)/(R+B)*4 and without hitting Run I select Fastie colormap and get this:

[![NIR_1849_Random.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/121/medium/NIR_1849_Random.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/121/original/NIR_1849_Random.jpg)

5) And when I hit Save, the image I download is this (for some mysterious reason):

[![NIR_1849_Random_2.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/123/medium/NIR_1849_Random_2.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/123/original/NIR_1849_Random_2.jpg)

6) And the previous image disappears. When I hit download again, I get the image showing the white Daisy colormap again...

7) I try a different formula in that same page - (R-B)/(R+B)*5. And select default colormap to get this:

[![NIR_1849_x_5.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/124/medium/NIR_1849_x_5.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/124/original/NIR_1849_x_5.jpg)

8) I then select Fastie colormap and get this:

[![2015-05-31T19_41_44.026Z.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/125/medium/2015-05-31T19_41_44.026Z.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/125/original/2015-05-31T19_41_44.026Z.jpg)

9) I upload the NIR Daisy image again but reduced in size to 800x600. I uploaded the image using "NDVI for BLUE filters" > Basic > Fastie colourmap and get this:

[![2015-05-31T19_44_05.402Z.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/126/medium/2015-05-31T19_44_05.402Z.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/126/original/2015-05-31T19_44_05.402Z.jpg)

10) I then repeat choosing RGB analysis > Run to get the NIR original image and then I select Grey analysis > Fastie colormap and get this:

[![2015-05-31T19_48_19.387Z.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/127/medium/2015-05-31T19_48_19.387Z.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/127/original/2015-05-31T19_48_19.387Z.jpg)

11) I then hit Run (same Grey analysis) and then select Fastie colormap to get this again:

[![2015-05-31T19_50_26.054Z.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/128/medium/2015-05-31T19_50_26.054Z.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/128/original/2015-05-31T19_50_26.054Z.jpg)

12) If I repeat step 12, I get this:

[![2015-05-31T19_51_21.357Z.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/129/medium/2015-05-31T19_51_21.357Z.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/129/original/2015-05-31T19_51_21.357Z.jpg)

If I repeat steps 1-4 I get the same white Daisy image so there is not randomness there... except step 6 does not happen again. The white Daisy image remains when I download it.

Any insights on any of this would be great! I am keen to learn ;) and even the Great Sherlock Holmes cannot figure out this one...
