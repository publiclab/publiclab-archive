[Oil testing kit Beta programme](http://publiclab.org/notes/ygzstc/07-14-2015/oil-testing-kit-beta-program) - Technical adjustments to Public Lab Spectrometer 3.0

Date: 4/Nov/2015

Here I document my experience making adjustments to the [Public Lab Spectrometer 3.0](http://publiclab.org/wiki/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0), which was assembled using [these instructions](http://publiclab.org/wiki/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0).

**Propping-up the cuvette holder and aligning the spectrometer**

When I started scanning the Mineral Oil sample [ HYPERLINK HERE ] no light was being captured. I separated the cuvette frame and spectrometer and I noticed that the laser beam was not passing through the centre of the 'viewing window' in the cuvette holder:

I then noticed that the slit in the slit card of the spectrometer did not aligning correctly to the 'viewing window':

I devised a support structure to prop-up the cuvette holder using small Lego parts:

[![Technical_issues--_IMG_4160_-_lego_piece.JPG](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/468/medium/Technical_issues--_IMG_4160_-_lego_piece.JPG)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/468/original/Technical_issues--_IMG_4160_-_lego_piece.JPG)


I inserted the Lego structure under the cuvette holder…

[![Technical_issues--_IMG_4162_-_lego_placement.JPG](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/469/medium/Technical_issues--_IMG_4162_-_lego_placement.JPG)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/469/original/Technical_issues--_IMG_4162_-_lego_placement.JPG)

…so that the cardboard rests between the Lego brick 'protrusions' (what are these circular things called?)

[![Technical_issues--_IMG_4163_-_lego_piece_in_place.JPG](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/470/medium/Technical_issues--_IMG_4163_-_lego_piece_in_place.JPG)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/470/original/Technical_issues--_IMG_4163_-_lego_piece_in_place.JPG)


Propped-up, the cuvette frame now looks like this:

[![Technical_issues--_IMG_4158_-_lego_final_look.JPG](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/471/medium/Technical_issues--_IMG_4158_-_lego_final_look.JPG)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/471/original/Technical_issues--_IMG_4158_-_lego_final_look.JPG)


The final adjustment - due to lack of time - was to keep the cuvette frame and spectrometer holding tightly and steadily together. I used mammoth tape, which does not stretch nor damage the cardboard yet can still be easily removed.

I taped the cuvette lid. I also taped the cuvette frame to the spectrometer in two places: on the side and at the bottom (not pictured here):

[![Technical_issues--_IMG_4164_-_frame_tape.JPG](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/472/medium/Technical_issues--_IMG_4164_-_frame_tape.JPG)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/472/original/Technical_issues--_IMG_4164_-_frame_tape.JPG)


**Issues which I have not tackled:**

1) The cuvette holder has enough room for the cuvette to move around. When I pushed the cuvette all the way to one side (left side looking towards the slit card from the cable feed) I got this…

[![Technical_issues--cuvette_positioned_left.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/474/medium/Technical_issues--cuvette_positioned_left.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/474/original/Technical_issues--cuvette_positioned_left.png)

…and when moved to the other side (right side looking towards the slit card from the cable feed):

[![Technical_issues--cuvette_positioned_right.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/473/medium/Technical_issues--cuvette_positioned_right.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/473/original/Technical_issues--cuvette_positioned_right.png)



2) The second issue is that the cuvette itself is ribbed on two sides and smooth on the other two. The spectrometer receives the light coming out from the ribbed side. I wondered if this makes a difference and it does: if the laser enters the sample through the ribbed side and the spectrometer captures the light coming out from the smooth side, more frequencies seem to be captured. I would like to test this further and post some photos in the future. For now I just wanted to point this out and ask if it this was perceived as non-problematic when choosing the cuvettes and/or the design of the spectrometer and cuvette frame and the way they fit together.
