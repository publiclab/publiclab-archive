[Ted](http://publiclaboratory.org/profile/TedF) and myself, Cindy will be hosting a two-part workshop on kite-mapping and map-making in London. Briefly, Part 1 is using kites to gather aerial imagery; Part 2 is making maps from the images collected using mapknitter.org. Join us!
 
**DIY Aerial Mapping Part.1 – Let’s fly kites!**

In this 2.5 hr workshop we'll roll-up our sleeves and learn about DIY aerial photography and how to use a kite to collect aerial imagery. Everyone will get to fly a delta kite (320 cm wing span) and attach the cameras to the kite line. Alongside the practical aspects, the session includes conversations about the methods and ethos of DIY, Public Lab, implications of aerial mapping, representation, inclusion, and privacy. We will also share stories of how aerial mapping has been used to address issues of social & environmental justice around the globe. This session also includes the technical and safety bits of DIY kite mapping! 

**NOTE: **No prior experience required. **NOTE 2:** If you are interested in mapping a specific area please do not hesitate to tell us! Send me an email to arrange for a site visit.

**When:** 2 - this event is weather-dependent. We will send you more information approx. 2 wks before the event.
