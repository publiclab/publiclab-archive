# Career goals after Outreachy

As I am in the final few weeks of my [Outreachy internship](https://www.outreachy.org/ "https://www.outreachy.org/") I will be sharing my career goals in this blog post. Working as an Outreachy intern for [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/about "https://publiclab.org/about") has helped me gain more insight into the type of career I want.

**Here's what I have learned or confirmed about myself.** I like learning and making things work. I like staying organized. For example, listing and prioritizing tasks so that I can work seamlessly. I like discussing with my team-mates, in the context of this internship my wonderful co-intern and mentors, and brainstorm about open issues. I have found myself to be more productive when I have some amount of freedom and flexibility in terms of time and space.

**I am looking for new opportunities to grow as a developer.** I am focused on looking for a job as a Frontend Web developer but I am also open to internships that will help me transition to a more permanent position. From my current internship experience, I have realized I liked working remote. Therefore I am looking for both remote positions and positions that require me to work on location in an office.

**The types of work of I would like to contribute to** are those that build upon or work towards solving issues in sustainability and welfare of our environment, our planet, and its inhabitants. Similar to my internship, if I can use my skills as a developer in these types of work it would be an amazing opportunity. I would love to learn and develop more skills so that I can contribute to the work that I find meaningful.

The skills I have right now are those that I can use in front end web development. I have HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding skills with some experience in React for web development and can also design websites using graphic design tools. I have been looking into back end technologies and have been learning to use NodeJS and MongoDB. I am also curious about Python and I often find myself getting sidetracked and trying out Python code. After I started coding seriously, I have come to realize that there is no end to my curiosity and that there are lot of things that I could learn to keep myself motivated.
