Bioluminescence is a light thats emitted by living organisms. John Lee gives a really good explanation on  this. [http://photobiology.info/LeeBasicBiolum.html](http://photobiology.info/LeeBasicBiolum.html)

I'm interested in this to make marine shipping more efficient, it will expand what they can see in the ocean and have a technology that's less disruptive than something like sonar. 

Our first design for this project is to use a interference filter to capture light in between the ranges 450-490nm and a photodiode to detect the light. We are thinking of using an arduino to support it. 

  
I'm new to do it yourself sensors and would appreciate support on the project, especially:

- Good places to buy an arduino
- Tips on waterproofing
- Places to explore existing codes
