We are looking into pieces for #wateristics and exploring sensors.

  
We came across this article: [https://makezine.com/projects/make-36-boards/how-to-use-leds-to-detect-light/](https://makezine.com/projects/make-36-boards/how-to-use-leds-to-detect-light/)

  
We want to know which is a better light sensor: LED or silicon photodiode? For #wateristic, we need the sensor to detect light in the 450-490 nm range, so a filter may be needed.
