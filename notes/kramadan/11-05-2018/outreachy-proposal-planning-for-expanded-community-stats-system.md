## About me

_My name is Abdel Ramadan. I am from Cameroon and I study software engineering in Saint Monica University Institute. I am very passionate about software and open source as it is one of the best ways to learn alongside experts and be exposed to a larger code base. I stumbled on Publiclab while browsing the Outreachy internship projects and I was interested. Joining the channels, I met people who are welcoming, open to help even those who've never contributed to open source before. I want to make this journey with PublicLab so as to continue learning from mentors and contributors._

**Affiliation** Student - Saint Monica University

**Location:** Buea, Cameroon

## Project description

_Extend community collaboration statistics and visualization system for PublicLab.org_

### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

Improve the UI/UX of the Public lab web app as well as the back-end.

### Problem

_I'm looking forward to designing a better interface for the PublicLab plots2 to enable it display statistics in an organized and better manner.  It will permit the display of data with the ability to filter it. The date selection will help display data in a graphical plots. Also, I'll have to work with the backend to enable the interface sync according with improvements made._

### Timeline/milestones

_Break your project up into small projects -- one per week!_

See this page for guidance on breaking your plan up into small, self-contained parts: [https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-18-2018/software-outreach-modularity-is-great-for-collaboration](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-18-2018/software-outreach-modularity-is-great-for-collaboration)
