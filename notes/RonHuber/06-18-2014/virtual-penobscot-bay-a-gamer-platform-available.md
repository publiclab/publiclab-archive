###WHY A VIRTUAL PENOBSCOT BAY?

Penobscot Bay is the heart of the New England lobster fishery, thanks to the fortunate coming-together  at the mouth of Penobscot Bay  of the Eastern Maine Coastal Current,  the fresh waters of Penobscot River, and  the Western Maine Coastal Current.  The interplay of the three amid the complicated seafloors and archipelagos of this bay  has made Penobscot Bay a lobster cornucopia; brackish at the narrow end, salty at its mouth  See photo of [ two typical trawl survey catches at mouth of Penobscot Bay](http://www.penbay.org/trawlsurvey/draglobsters.html)

Below are links to efforts at creating 3D representations of Penobscot Bay.It is my hope and anticipation that  creating a 3D Penobscot Bay, properly  populated  with standard seasonal currents and thermoclines,  updating monitoring data,  seasonal inmigrations and outmigrations of present and historic fish  invertebrate and unicellular species.

Maine DEP has already mapped nearly all recognized waste dumps, spills,  wastewater treatment plantsand other ecologically impacting locations to google earth. MDEP updates it as they can.

Avatars would be important so that point of view fly-throughs   are possible , with those avatars limited to organisms commonly found there,, with each species avatar being subject to limits of  the type of bay animal they are,  and to weather, currents and  all the other variables. "Players" will have to learn  how sense  their prey and predators  and landbased impacts  like oil spill pollution within the virtual bay  if they are to survive
. 
To me  the existing  virtual efforts are rather  primitive

 [A circulation animation ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KktMwzvXwc&list=FL-GqKFBmnkxtx5nUakHT7oQ) I commissioned  from a graphics designer to show the predominant currents of the Gulf of Maine, the flow of lobster larvae  and the possible effect of putting floating windfarms in their path - instead of safely further out.

DATA FOR  GULF OF MAINE  that could be mapped to outer part of bay and nearby Gulf of Maine

Again,these are overly simple and  lack interaction. We need a more "Game" style production  with the greography populated by existing bathrymetry, then overlaid as above.  Are there "game templates one can "fill in the blanks" with data and fill it with a vurtual ecosystem?
