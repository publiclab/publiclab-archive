#Questions and next steps: I have some doubts we've folded this_ quite _correctly. The final version needs some visible coding of tabs and slots in the paper.

#Why I'm interested.  Lots of oily places around Penobscot Bay, which like the rest of US began in the 1920s  to take note of petroleum spills and leaks  as  a serious challenge to nature . See several short reports of that era  by the US Commssioner of Fisheries
