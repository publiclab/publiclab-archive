6/16/14  Our effort continues to pressure state and federal agencies in carry out their required  tests of the beach and intertidal flats of SW Stockton Harbor for heavy metals and acids

Below is a list of heavy metals associated with phosphogypsum wastes  from identical abandoned  fertilizer waste dumps.  Are they within the scope of the sensor/ testing systems  people have access to? I think so.

**But first,** things have been moving along quickly. Lines being drawn.  See coverage over  the last few days of this issue on TV news, a print paper and  online-only news gatherer Pen Bay Pilot

Local online news group [Pen Bay Pilot ](http://www.penbaypilot.com/article/feds-investigate-alleged-pollution-searsport-beach/35750)
 
Local television news [WCSH/ WLBZ ](http://www.wcsh6.com/story/news/local/2014/06/25/kidder-point-friends-of-penobscot-bay-maine-dep-gac-chemical/11366981/)

Local newspaper [Republican Journal- saved onto the Pen Bay Blog](http://penobscotbay.blogspot.com/2014/06/newspaper-study-finds-acidic-mud-at.html)  (Most comprehensive coverage.) 

As one expects the company and its attendant state agency are hailing the quality of GAC's PRESENT DAY operations and avoiding the fact of the great hoard of pollutants eroding off the company shore,left there by past operators. But somewhat of the issue's importance got through.  For the coast guard to evince respect for Maine DEP's see-no-evil attitude under controversial Commissioner Patricia Aho's reign is disappointing but I think with additional details we can get them on the right path. 

**HEAVY METALS**
A web search of federal cases  concerning nearly identical abandoned superphosphate plants elsewhere  and other information outlets, have shown phosphogypsum waste to typically be tainted with the following metals:
chromium, 
cobalt, 
nickel, 
copper, 
zinc, 
arsenic, 
selenium, 
silver, 
cadmium, 
antimony, 
mercury,
 thallium, 
lead, 
uranium
radium.

The latter two metals are known to be most significant in the wastes generated by fertilizer producers using phosphate ore from central Florida as feedstock.  That location is aka "Bone Valley"   We have records  showing the actual shipments of phosphate between central Florida and Searsport in the early/mid  20th century. Even of a "Bone Valley" fertilizer company in Maine.

Of interest is that as a result central Florida-originated phosphogypsum  is considered too heavily tainted with radium and uranium by the Florida and federal government to be re-used for almost any consumer exposed purpose. It must be kept in piles that are carefully fully capped. The waste erosion taking place in Stockton Harbor would be quite illegal in Florida. But the state of Maine HAS no phosophogypsum management law or regs. So we are appeal to the good graces of our federal agencies.
