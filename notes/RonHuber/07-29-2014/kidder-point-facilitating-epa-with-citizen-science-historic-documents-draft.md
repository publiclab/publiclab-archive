Friends thanks for everyone's interest!  I would like to bring into sharp focus our information by category  by era, and interactIon with nature.  Please please note gaps and data quality observations and suggestions to your heart's contents

I AM LINKING USEFUL DATA TO  THE LIST BELOW . HELP IT BE JUST WHAT EPA NEEDS. (More to come)
[What EPA is looking for](http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/hrsres/fact/sascreen.pdf) See page 6 of that pdf

**GOAL **
Supply US EPA with sufficient well organized information for them to feel reasonably certain that they understand the nature of the anthropogenic impacts to that intertidal wetland and water body  when they carry out their preliminary screening.

[ GAC CHEMICAL - RELATED DATA AND INFO ARCHIVE](http://penbay.org/gac/)   Here's the disorderly lot. 
**Note: that Delta Chemical is the predecessor to GAC Chemical - from 1970 when shore-dumping halted more or less to 1995, when GAC CHemical took over.**  _Pray click about in that and help select the best - nearly every file is filename-explanatory_ and we'll post it here.
