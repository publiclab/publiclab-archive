It has been decided that the next round of experiments will take place at the first well pad off the main road, Sunray 1.

The experiment will take place in two parts, one will be placed out for one week, one will be placed out for one month. 

Each test site will have two container, one labeled in blue, and one in black. The containers labeled in black will be left out for one month, the containers labeled in blue will be left out for only one week.

The containers will be placed in a compass rose position around the well.

The containers will be placed in rings radiating out from the well, in 50’ increments, one set of 8 containers at 50’, one at 100’ and one at 150’

This site will test a total of 48 containers; the containers will all be oriented vertically.

Kit.

The kit I sent out for this experiment contains the following pieces:

3 black photo bags, labeled 1, 2 & 3
2 measuring strings, 50' & 25'
4 control containers

Instructions.

The contents of the bag labeled 1, is meant to be placed 50' away from the well pad. A 50' string is included as a measuring device. Each bag contains 8 pairs of labeled containers, the photo paper already inside, stake attached, ready to go. Each pair should be placed in the compass rose position, which is on their label. (One of the pair is labeled in blue , to be collected after one week and one is labeled in black to be collected after one month)

Bag 2
The measurements for placement of the containers in bag 2 should be taken from the containers from bag one.

Bag 3
The measurements for placement of the containers in bag 3 should be taken from the bag two.

Controls:

Control 1 
Stick in ground near container from bag one, the blue will be collected after one week, the black after one month. Container is sealed closed, do not open!

Control 2
The photo paper is meant to be removed from these containers and taped to something on site (a rock, fence) near containers from bag one. This control is meant to see the difference in exposure with and without the container.
