New Experimental Designs

SR1

At this site containers will be placed in a compass rose position around the well.

The containers will be placed in rings radiating out from the well, in 50’ increments, one set of 8 containers at 50’, one at 100’ and one at 150’

Experiment will run for one week, in order to duplicate the results of the last test and one month.
This will be accomplished my duplicating all of the containers.

This site will test a total of 48 containers; the containers will all be oriented vertically.

SR2

At this site containers will be placed in a compass rose position around the well.

The containers will be placed in rings radiating out from the well, in 50’ increments, one set of 8 containers at 50’.

Experiment will run for one week, in order to duplicate the results of the last test and one month.

This experiment will test different two different container types, horizontal and vertical.

Each point on the compass rose will have four containers. One vertical, one week, one vertical one month, one horizontal one week, and one horizontal one month.

The site will need 32 containers.

For the next round of experiments we will need 128 containers
