# Summary of Lionel Milberger’s Copper Test

<strong>Focus of test is on residential ambient air from a fraction of a ppm to <100ppm</strong>

<strong>Considerations:</strong>

•	H2S is highly soluble in water and water vapor in air
•	Shortcoming of handheld instruments is that that do not 
        measure the H2S dissolved in water vapors. These tests                       
        are especially inaccurate at exposure levels < 100ppm, 
        which are the levels of interest for this study.
•	H2S is heavier than air and thus gathers in low places
•	Specimens should not remain in the ambient air longer 
        than three days, so as to minimize oxidation by the 
        oxidation by the oxygen in the air.
•	Lionel says the Copper Rod Test is only a positive 
        indication of the presence of H2S, it will not tell the 
        exact amount or exact time of exposure, but the major 
        advantage is that it is always “looking” and no    
        operator is required to be present.
•	Advantage of this test is the ability to accumulate 
        dew, and register the H2S dissolved in water vapor.
•	H2S will impregnate all known sample containers: 
        Glass, Plastic, Stainless Steel, ect.

<strong>Next Steps:</strong>

•	Identify and quantify the exact copper-sulfur compounds 
        present on the test specimens.
•	Correlate exposure patterns and amount of blackening to 
        known concentrations of H2S over practical periods of 
        time.

<strong>Questions:</strong>

•	Can this test be quantifiable? Is it possible to match 
        density of discoloration to a known quantity? If 
        photographing in order to document, is there a way 
        standardizing photos? Maybe a white paper that gets 
        sent with kit so photo can be color corrected.
•	Is it worth testing other metals to see how they react  
        when exposed to H2S, steel, lead, iron ect.? 

<strong>Applications to Photographic Paper Test:</strong>

•	Can the photographic paper accumulate dew as well?
•	Specimens should not remain in the ambient air longer 
        than three days, so as to minimize oxidation by the 
        oxidation by the oxygen in the air. Is this true for 
        the photographic paper as well.
