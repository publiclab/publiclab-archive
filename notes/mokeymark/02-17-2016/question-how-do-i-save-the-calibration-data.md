###What I want to do or know
I just put together the mini foldable spectroscope and captured an image of the spectra from a fluorescent light. I uploaded it, selected the cross-section, and clicked the calibrate button. When I hit the "Apply" button, I get the notification "The tag you've applied couldn't be saved, but it's been run locally. Clear it now." and the "Save" button just displays the spinning circle icon forever. I can't save a calibration.

This is on my desktop computer, running the latest Chrome browser. I also tried Internet Explorer with the same results. On Chrome on my Galaxy Note 4 phone, the browser just crashes whenever I try to perform a capture.
