Hi, 

I have a modified camera to capture NIR images. In the last events, I have been experienced a systematic problem. All the pics taken appear not proper to use in NDVI analysis - the top right corner always return low values of NDVI (fig. 2).

Follow some of my examples: The first image is a NIR-raw (fig. 1). The second, is a NDVI image processed using ArcMaps software (fig. 2). 

Ps: This problem happens independent of the hour of day, excluding the possibility of shading.   

Does anyone has a suggestion for this issue?

Thank you very much!
