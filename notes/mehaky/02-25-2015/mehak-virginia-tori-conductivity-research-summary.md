Our research results didn't vastly differ from what we expected; as it turns out, the saltier the water, the more electricity it conducted, and the higher the pitch of the frequency produced by the speakers on our coquis. The samples of snow we collected that were visibly dirtier and murkier than fresh water from a snowdrift, a pond, or unsalted snow would produce noise that measured in higher hertz. For example, water taken from dirty, old snow on the side of the road in Mission Hill measured at around 3,257 hertz whereas water taken from freshly fallen snow on top of a car measured around 700 hertz.
