Just as an interesting exercise, is it possible to process, say a .bmp version of an infragram image, in such a way as to retrieve a true-color image? I suggest .bmp because of the very simple 3 (RGB) bytes per pixel file format which makes it easy to  modify these values. What do these bytes represent in the near-IR image? Is there an algorithm to edit them "back" to a true color image? Or is there no relationship which will work repeatably for different kinds of scenes?
