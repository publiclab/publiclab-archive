###What I want to do or know
By deafult, the picture captured by Web camera is analyzed by the Spectra WorkBench application.  Instead of using the living picture, I need to analyze a picture captured by my iphone. After uploading this picture, I do not know the next step for analyzing the spectrum of this picture ( as the default setting for living picture). Please help!
Many thanks!
