Manoomin is the Anishinaabe word for wild rice (Zizania palustris) and it is a sacred food to the Anishinaabe. The Anishinaabe (also known as Ojibwe or Chippewa) are a North American tribe located around the Great Lakes region. Manoomin is an annual aquatic grass that only grows in North America. The Anishinaabe harvest Manoomin in August, when the plant is ripe during Manoominike Giizis (wild ricing moon). Manoomin grows in shallow rivers, lakes, and wetlands and the plant is a good indicator of the health of an ecosystem.
