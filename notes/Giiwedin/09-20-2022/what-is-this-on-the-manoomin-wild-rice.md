This photo was taken at 2:55 PM September 3, 2022 at White Oak Lake, Zemple Minnesota. The wild rice grains appear to have a sort of fungus that we hypothesize was ergot, although another observer suggested that this was potentially smut. Any opinions from folks who have seen this on other plant relatives?
