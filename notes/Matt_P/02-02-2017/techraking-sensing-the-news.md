### DESCRIPTION

Developed for journalists, designers, technologists and anyone interested in how to use sensors for community engagement, this TechRaking will explore how this nascent stage of the Internet of Things, made up of low-cost sensors and hardware to collect original data, brings unique opportunities and challenges to the newsroom.

Over the course of the day, you'll hear from industry experts who have created successful sensor projects and stories, learn what is (and what isn't) possible in implementing sensor technology and what resources are available for newsrooms putting sensor journalism into practice.

Attendees will also have a chance to hack a solution to a presented challenge focused on empowering journalists to incorporate sensor tools and techniques into their newsgathering workflows. The winning concept will receive resources post-event to see their idea through to fruition.

Confirmed speakers include:

  
Lily Bui, MIT

Lorie Hearn, inewsource

Travis Good, San Diego Maker Faire

Christine Sunu, flashBANG Product Development

Andy Wickert, Northern Widget

Sean Bonner, Safecast

Eric Frost, San Diego State University
