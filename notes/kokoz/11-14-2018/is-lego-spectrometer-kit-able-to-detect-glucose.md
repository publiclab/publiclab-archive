I'm trying to figure out how to detect Glucose using spectrophotometry in urine. There are some papers that describe very accurate readings using near-infrared spectrophotometry but as far as I understand it's measured between the 1300-2500nm wavelengths. I wonder if it's somehow achievable using the kit, perhaps with a different camera? 

  
Thoughts?  

  
Here are some papers I've read:
