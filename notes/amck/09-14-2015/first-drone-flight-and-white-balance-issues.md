I recently purchased a Filter Kit and installed the included #2007 blue filter on a new ELPH 130IS.  Yesterday I attached the camera to my quadcopter and collected ~600 images covering 60 acres of mixed agricultural land.  Lacking anything other than a random solid blue Mead folder that was lying around, I set the white balance on the camera with the frame filled with the folder.  The images mostly came out great and processed flawlessly in Photoscan, but there seemed to be an awful lot of light coming into the Green channel.  In fact, the green histogram is nearly identical to the red channel of every image.  I assume this is an issue with how I set the white balance.  

Does anyone have any specific recommendations with what medium is currently preferred to correctly minimize the green channel of the starting image?  I've seen suggestions of test paper and led lights, but I'm not sure what the best option is for most field settings.

I'll post some of the full NIR 3D models when I get everything processed.
