###What I want to do
OpenDroneMap ([http://opendronemap.github.io/odm/](http://opendronemap.github.io/odm/)) is intended to be a tool to postprocess small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAS), balloon, kite, and street view data to geographic data.

###My attempt and results
The toolchain will currently produce a point cloud (in relative, not geographic space) using computer vision stereo matching between images (Structure from Motion and Multi-Stereo View techniques).

e.g.: One of the input images

[![image.PNG](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/007/845/medium/image.PNG)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/007/845/original/image.PNG)

Output point cloud:

###Questions and next steps
Next steps to have the tool chain generate a surface model (mesh), and texture that model, as well as produce an orthophoto.

###Why I'm interested
It is really easy, whether with balloon, kite, or drone to produce a huge number of images to process, and there is no current way to leverage the implicit information in the photos to rapidly produce a digital surface model and orthophoto. OpenDroneMap is intended to close that gap.
