###What I want to do
Project semester goal(s):
•	*Benchmarking Riffle sensor data

•	*We will be looking for solutions with known values for conductivity and use liquids with different temperatures to test how well the sensors read the data (check for percent error)

•	Comparing Riffle measurements to other sensors’ measurements

•	Looking at statistical analysis of data for usable conclusions

###My attempt and results

###Questions and next Steps
Questions:
•	What kinds of data analysis should we use for our data?

•	For Goal #2, what kind/type of sensor should we use?

•	Where should we get our data? (Location)
