I live in a town next to a business called Aluf Plastics. They manufacture industrial liners and other plastic products in its 500,000-square-foot factory, which runs six days a week, 24 hours a day.

  
Our local paper has written much about this:  

https://www.lohud.com/story/news/2018/03/06/orangeburg-residents-want-aluf-clear-air/394923002/  

  
I am on the periphery of the group of organizers "Clean Air for Orangetown" who have been organizing and lobbying local politicians to enforce regulations and sanctions on Aluf; however, we have had trouble getting proper scientific testing done to prove something that the those who live close to Aluf (my dear friends) suffer every day. Stenches so bad that they literally suffocate the youth in the area.  The town high school and an elementary school are not more than 1 mile away.

  
The problem has been that the one scientific study that was done was poorly executed and yielded inconclusive results, such that getting support from our town and state government has proven difficult. 

  
Specifically, one report stated:

Air Safety 

All analysis and commentary within this memo relate to the TRC Emissions Evaluation Report. Our statement as regarding the ambient air in the area from our memorandum of April 22nd, 2018 is reiterated here for the record: "Area testing as conducted recently indicates the air has minimal to no risk for residents, with all levels of all chemicals falling below the Short Term Guideline Concentrations (SGC's), and most falling below the Annual Guideline Concentrations (AGC's). There were small exceedances of AGCs' for Acrolein, Benzene and Carbon Tetrachloride, but even if one were to apply the 24-hour samples to the AGC's these small exceedances would have minimal or no impact on health, given that the AGC's are set very conservatively. However, as these are 24 hour samples and complaints appear to be sporadic/not continuous, it is impossible to know with certainty whether such a projection would actually be an accurate representation of a resident's annual exposure, whether higher or lower." 

  
I have attached a few documents here for background.

My questions to a more enlightened group is:

- Do the scientists here have the same conclusions as found in the studies attached?
- What may we do with science to push things forward?
- How can we leverage the network and potentially hardware of Public Lab to help?

Forgive me, since I am not a scientist, nor familiar with how this network works, so I am just posting as complete of a picture of what the challenge is in hopes that someone may be able to provide some advice.
