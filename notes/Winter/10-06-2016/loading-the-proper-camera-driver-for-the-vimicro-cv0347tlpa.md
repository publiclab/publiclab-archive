###What I want to do or know?
I would like to load the correct driver for the VIDEW JDEPC-OV04 camera for Windows 10.

###Background story
I can access the camera with Windows 10 and Windows Camera program.
The spec sheet notes that the RAW format output is only accessible with the correct driver.  The Vimicro website does not have drivers for this model camera.

What are my options if I can not access full functionality under Windows 10?  Which OS (Windows, OSX, Linux) will allow full functionality? Where can I download the proper drivers?

I was hoping to use this camera to take RAW Infragram photos.

Thanks

Reference sites that I believe should have the proper drivers:
