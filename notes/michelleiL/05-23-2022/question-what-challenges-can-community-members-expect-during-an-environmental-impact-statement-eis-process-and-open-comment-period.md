One of the most crucial times to share community science findings and stories about the environmental, social, and health impacts of proposed toxic industries is the open comment period during an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process. 

As both the [Game Over Formosa][1] and [Minnesota Land and Wild Rice][2] fellowship teams continue their research and advocacy efforts in their respective communities that includes preparing for an open comment period, I am wondering what challenges can be expected during this process?
