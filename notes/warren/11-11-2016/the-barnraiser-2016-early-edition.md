Public Lab's daily "newspaper" -- [the Barnraiser][1] -- is back at this year's Barnraising, and the first issue is already out after the Organizers summit on Thursday. Digital edition available below (and [in PDF format here][2]).

This year, as you can see, we've done an analog (paper-based) layout -- on a large poster sheet which you'll see in the cafeteria. 

  
Over the course of the day, please feel free to suggest articles by dropping a post-it onto the layout, or submitting photos to jeff@publiclab.org. If you're on DOCCOM, or part of the Barnraiser's "staff," the same goes for you! 

  
We'll gather after dinner to make editorial decisions and write out the final version together, on the poster itself. As today, printing and distribution happens just before breakfast!  

  
Thanks to everyone who helped out last night -- @marlokeno, @kgradow1, @sarasage, and others!
