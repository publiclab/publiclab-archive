This 3.5 x 5.5 inch illustrated booklet was printed at the AS220 community print shop by Jacque Bidon, and includes 64 pages of illustrated community-developed guidance and tips on balloon and kite mapping. It was [collaboratively written](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-01-2017/collaboratively-write-the-new-pocket-guide-to-grassroots-mapping) by dozens of Public Lab community members.

Shown is the final mockup -- the final print will be in red ink.

Available for pre-order now at $10 each! We expect to ship in February 2018:
