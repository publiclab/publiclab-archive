##Event details

Via Avery Louie's (of http://bosslab.org) posting: 

> Hello Everyone!

> It's that hackathon time again!  This time we are pleased to bring you Jeff Warren and Cort B. of Public labs who will be coming to talk about their open source, low cost spectrometer

> [Check out what we have done at previous hackathons](http://bosslab.org/post/46231525182/pcr-hackathon-ii-it-cycles)! This will of course be worked on again this time but a broader spectrum of projects is also encouraged, such as incubators and general sensor/software projects.  [Check it out](http://bosslab.org/projects/lightbulb-pcr/)!

> It will be on Sunday 12th May, and just like last time, we will be starting at noon and going until people get tired. If possible we need you to bring your own power supplies/temperature sensors/arduinos.  Registration is free but [please RSVP here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VMvNFGVV-FUAkulBvC5Rx4jjVGx7xiY6ddHGeBJGMqs/viewform) - it helps us know what to expect.

> Bring your friends, coworkers, aunts/uncles/cousins/siblings/ friends for extra fun!  Let me know if you have any questions!

> See you there!

> Avery
