As part of our series on all the amazing work that's been done with kite and balloon mapping over the years -- work that's led to our [new Mini Balloon and Kite kits](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/kickstarter-gold-balloon-mapping-kits/), today we'd like to highlight a number of educational projects from our community and partners over the years.

## Parts & Crafts

To start with, this morning we ran an activity with [Parts & Crafts](http://partsandcrafts.org/) in Somerville, Massachusetts, who have been a great partner over the years. Parts & Crafts is a makerspace for kids and their friends, and an alternative school program and DIY-centric camp. They've [done a lot of Public Lab projects since the very start](http://publiclab.org/tag/parts-and-crafts), and this week was **Girls Invention Week** -- so we took the Mini Kite Kite out for a spin with some amazing girl inventors!

We've kite-mapped with Parts & Crafts before, too -- read more about their work at: [https://publiclab.org/tag/parts-and-crafts](https://publiclab.org/tag/parts-and-crafts)

## Public Mapping Mission - Newtown Creek

The Public Mapping Mission was a combination online/offline course and a collaboration between Public Lab, [GovLab Academy](http://govlabacademy.org/), the [Center for Urban Science and Progress](http://cusp.nyu.edu/) and the [MIT Media Lab](http://media.mit.edu/). The second part of the course was a public event in which participants mapped Newtown Creek on December 7th. This is their story...

> _After a rainy and cold Friday night, the forecast for Saturday afternoon was looking much better. High of 41ºF with 10-15mph winds from the west, and indeed it was a clear, cold and windy day. Our group of dedicated mappers met at Newtown Creek at the Plank Road site in the afternoon. We were carrying two kites, two Public Lab balloon kits, an 80cf tank of helium and other miscellaneous supplies._
> 
> _Shortly after our arrival on foot, an armada of canoes from the North Brooklyn Boating Club arrived, reinforcing our efforts and providing naval support..._

## A Balloon Mapping Curriculum in Chicago

In 2014, Meghan Jain spent about a month creating a Balloon Mapping Curriculum, which you can download from her post: [https://publiclab.org/notes/mjain26/07-28-2014/youth-balloon-mapping-workshop-complete](https://publiclab.org/notes/mjain26/07-28-2014/youth-balloon-mapping-workshop-complete)

She and [Benjamin Sugar](https://publiclab.org/profile/bsugar) worked at [Civic Lab](http://www.civiclab.us/) in Chicago with 12-15 students to build rigs and fly cameras using the Balloon Mapping Kit. The curriculum notes that:

_When members of a community are faced with a problem, generally they need evidence. Most people rely on labs to produce these studies. Through using balloons and kites to produces areal image data, citizens can increase the amount of power they have. Using a balloon is inexpensive and accessible, which helps members of the community engage in their civic communities. The more they know, they more they can do._
