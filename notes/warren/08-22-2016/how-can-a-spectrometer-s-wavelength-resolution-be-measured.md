### What I want to do or know

We're looking to post specs (har har) for the [Desktop Spectrometry Starter Kit](/wiki/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0), and I want to post that (to my best estimate), that if well constructed, the DSSK alone can get approximately 2 nanometer resolution -- meaning that you can distinguish two peaks which are 2 nanometers apart. 

See https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/10-06-2015/twin-peaks-tb-or-hg for some discussion of these two peaks! 

How might we ask a bunch of people with properly-constructed spectrometers to report in their resolution in a standardized way?
