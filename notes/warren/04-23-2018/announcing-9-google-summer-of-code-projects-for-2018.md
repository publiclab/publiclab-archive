:tada::tada::tada::tada::tada::tada::tada::tada::tada:

We're happy to announce we're accepting 9 students through Google Summer of Code this season. This is almost double last year's 5 slots, and reflects big, positive changes in our community this past year.**Update: we also just learned that we are working with a team of two through [Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/)!**

  
(I've [cross-posted this here](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/2653))

We've seen a dramatic rise in newcomers over the past year (read [more here](/software-outreach) and follow #software-outreach), and over a dozen contributors emerged as community leaders, not only championing larger and more complex projects, but also welcoming in and supporting newcomers to grow our community. Many of this year's students are in this group.

Congratulations and thanks: @MaggPi, @Gauravano @namangupta @Vidit @tech4GT @mridulnagpal @bansal\_sidharth2996 @sagarpreet @Souravirus

See all the proposals here: [https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/02-15-2018/call-for-summer-of-code-2018-proposals](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/02-15-2018/call-for-summer-of-code-2018-proposals)

We'd also like to thank those who have made it possible, through their supportive mentoring, for our community to see such successes -- including those who help (beyond coding) to shape the course of our software projects by proposing new features, and those who help to set the positive, welcoming tone that makes our project one which people want to join.

Congratulations to our 9 summer projects, and thanks also to those whose projects weren't selected. We wish we could work with all of you, and we deeply appreciate what you contribute.
