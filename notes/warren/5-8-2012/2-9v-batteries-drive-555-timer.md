I managed to endurance-test using 2 9v batteries to drive a [555 timer](/wiki/dual-camera-kit-guide) for 55 minutes.

I'll be writing better documentation for this in the wiki in the next day or two. [Chris Fastie](/people/cfastie) has some other [lighter-weight options too](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/5-2-2012/no-output-signal-ir-kit-timer) -- i just wanted to see what a simple version would look like.
