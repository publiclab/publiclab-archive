Hi all, I'm preparing for a talk with Liz Barry ( @liz) at LibrePlanet 2018 on Sunday at

It'll livestream at [https://libreplanet.org/2018/live/](https://libreplanet.org/2018/live/)

The program is here: [https://libreplanet.org/2018/program/](https://libreplanet.org/2018/program/)

> Sharing strategies for welcoming newcomers into FLOSS projects: First-timers-only, list moderation, and more

Room: 32-123 - Time: 15:25-16:10 (Eastern Time)

> Since early 2016, Public Lab has worked to [make our free software projects more welcoming and inclusive](/software-outreach), and to grow our software contributor community in diversity and size. We have learned from and incorporated strategies from other communities like the Hoodie Project, SpinachCon, and [FirstTimersOnly.com](http://FirstTimersOnly.com), and shared our own ideas, and this session will cover a range of principles and strategies that have emerged across a number of separate efforts in different FLOSS projects. Topics will include: 

> 1) friendliness,

> 2) Codes of Conduct,

> 3) first-timers-only issues,

> 4) welcoming pages,

> 5) social media outreach,

> 6) code modularity,

> 7) ladders of participation,

> 8) continuous integration,

> 9) friendly bots, and

> 10) evaluation.
