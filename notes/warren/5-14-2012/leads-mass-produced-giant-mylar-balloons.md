Looking for a place to try to get 1.8 meter mylar balloons made, maybe eventually for inclusion in the [balloon mapping kit](/wiki/balloon-mapping-kit-retail).

Anyways, I'm writing to them asking:

> I am with a company selling science kits and we need a bulk order of 180cm wide circular mylar foil balloons. Can you produce these in 1000-5000 unit quantities?

Close enough to the truth... :-)
