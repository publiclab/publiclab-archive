As announced last week, a range of projects to improve and expand the PublicLaboratory.org are in the planning stages. Some are making good progress and may be testing some ideas in the next few weeks. Here's a recap:

##Tool page redesign##

Tool pages present information on Public Lab tools, but they can get out-of-date and are more aimed at newcomers. Folks are discussing how tool pages could be more useful to active contributors and experimenters who are actively improving and extending tools.
