Raspberry Pi just launched their Pi NoIR - a filter-less camera for the Raspberry Pi low-cost computer board, and they've also just posted a big blog post about another thing that ships with the new camera board. See above -- look familiar? It's a piece of Rosco #74 filter, the same one that ships in the [Public Lab Infragram Filter Pack](http://store.publiclab.org/products/infragram-diy-filter-pack)! 

It's no coincidence -- we've been talking with them for a while and testing the filters with pre-production versions of the camera. Read more:

> There’s a long history of doing this stuff from space (the Landsat vehicles, for example, look at the Earth across a very broad spectrum), and Public Lab have done loads of research as part of their Infragram project (and associated Kickstarter) to find ways of modifying cameras, and to find cheap alternatives to expensive optical bandgap filters. Our friend Roscolux #2007 Storaro Blue (that’s the blue thing’s full name) turns out to be a great example – we buy it on giant reels and the guys at the factory in Wales where we make the Raspberry Pi and both kinds of camera board cut it up into little squares for you to use. It’s not very expensive at all for us to provide you with a little square of blue, and it adds a lot of extra functionality to the camera that we hope you’ll enjoy playing with.

So LOTS more [infragram filters](/wiki/infragram) are about to ship! The RPi folks give a great shout out, too: 

> The work of the folk at Public Lab has been absolutely vital in helping us understand all this, and we’re very grateful to them for their work on finding suitable filters at low prices, and especially on image processing. We strongly recommend that you visit Public Lab’s Infragram to process your own images. We’re talking to Public Lab at the moment about working together on developing some educational activities around Pi NoIR. We’ll let you know what we come up with right here.

And they posted some sample pics via [Mat Lippincott](/profile/mathew)

> We sent Matthew Lippincott from Public Lab an early Pi NoIR (and a blue thing), and he sent it up on a quadcopter to take some shots of the tree canopy, which he’s processed using Infragram, to show you what’s possible.

There's also a longer post about some of the tests Andrew Back did on the filters over at DesignSpark: http://designspark.com/eng/blog/fun-with-pi-noir-and-filters

[Chris Fastie](/profile/cfastie) has already run some demo photos through the [Infragram.org service](http://infragram.org):
