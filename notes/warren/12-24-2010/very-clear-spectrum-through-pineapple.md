We had a workshop at Escuelab in Lima, using DIY spectrometers last Friday/Saturday, and one group (led by Luis) took this fantastic spectrum of sunlight passing through a piece of pineapple. See the very clear lines to the right side -- we'll have to compare to a reference sunlight spectrum and perhaps a water spectrum to see if we got anything from the pineapple itself.
