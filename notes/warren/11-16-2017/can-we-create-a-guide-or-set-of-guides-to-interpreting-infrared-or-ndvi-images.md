# Can we create a guide or set of guides to interpreting infrared or NDVI images?

Folks often ask for help in interpreting multispectral imagery (like [NDVI](https://publiclab.org/wiki/ndvi) images) such as collected using [DIY Infragram cameras](https://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram), and this is just as relevant for satellite-based infrared imagery. 

  
Maybe we could develop guides for things like:

  
- comparing agricultural practices
- identifying groundwater patterns

There are already some good notes on NDVI in agriculture on the Public Lab site but they're not necessarily in step-by-step guide format. And there's tutorials on creating imagery composites, but not on what exactly they mean!

We'd love help in building out this kind of resource!
