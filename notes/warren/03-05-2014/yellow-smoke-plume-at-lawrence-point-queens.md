Yesterday, I was riding the Amtrak train past Lawrence Point in Queens, NY, and saw twin smokestacks emitting clouds. But one of them had a distinctly yellow color. What's up with that? I wonder if we could measure an absorption line [with our spectrometers](/wiki/refinery-watching) in the sunlight going through that plume. 

Anyone know more about this site and what that might be? The site is here: 

https://www.google.com/maps?ll=40.789224,-73.906075&spn=0.005307,0.006325&t=h&z=18

Here's a Google Maps 3d view of the smokestacks:

Also, http://alerts.skytruth.org doesn't show anything for that site:
