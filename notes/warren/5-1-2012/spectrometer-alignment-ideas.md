Sorry this looks a bit cryptic, but I'm brainstorming some ways to align a spectrometer with a distant source of pollution. I was thinking:

* velcro a drinking straw to a spectrometer
* sweep it vertically and horizontally across a bright light (or pair of lights)
* adjust the straw to line up with the light at the same moment you see the spectrum brighten in the [Spectral Workbench client software](https://spectralworkbench.org).

I don't know if this will work, but Shannon was also thinking of using a golf sight, so it seems like we have to get out there and test it...
