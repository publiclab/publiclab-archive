Last week, we wrapped up our 2020 Outreachy and Google Summer of Code programs, involving a team of super cool fellows -- 7, with 3 joining via #Outreachy and 4 via #GSoC.

(see the above visualization of \`plots2\` work at [http://ghv.artzub.com/#repo=plots2&climit=300&user=publiclab](http://ghv.artzub.com/#repo=plots2&climit=300&user=publiclab) !)

We were grateful to have these interns working on some challenging problems which have had a huge impact on our web projects here at Public Lab. We are also super happy to have worked as a big "family" in these hard times. The fellows have now wrapped up their work, tested their code, pushed code to production and have written brilliant documentation so that new contributors can easily understand and continue their legacy. 🎈

We had a very successful summer, with a huge number of critical features being introduced in existing projects and some incredible collaborations. 👏👏👏![image description](/i/40880.png "unnamed.png")

All the fellows opened so many [first-timer-only issues](https://code.publiclab.org) (Replacing `.length` and `.count` with `.size` issues really made an impact with ~20 new contributors solving them!!!). There was awesome collaboration especially with [PublicLab.Editor](https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor/issues/490) team, which shows how we have grown and developed cooperative practices. All the fellows showed great leadership and guided their co-fellows as well as first-timers in the right direction whenever needed, which was crucial to the SUCCESS of the summer project 😁

Overall, we are super pleased, and wanted to offer a big _CONGRATULATIONS_ to everyone who participated: students/interns/fellows, mentors, and also all the newcomers who came and joined in on these projects. 🚀🚀🚀

We would love to have you all connected with us even after this summer, and wish all the best for your future endeavors. Here are everyone's final reports. And again, GREAT WORK!!! 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉
