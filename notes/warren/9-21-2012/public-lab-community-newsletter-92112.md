We've had a **very** busy week with lots of new folks on the list -- over 200 new members since the beginning of the month. Here's a roundup of what's been going on:

* **LEAFFEST** - this weekend is a Vermont event organized by Chris Fastie - events will include electronic sensor hacking, leaf pile temperature monitoring, infrared camera modification and getting hands-on with spectrometers. If the weather holds we'll be doing some flights as well: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/9-5-2012/l-e-f-f-e-s-t
* **Live streaming from a balloon or kite** is becoming easier and cheaper with Don Blair's recent post about using a Raspberry Pi and a webcam -- http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/donblair/9-20-2012/raspberry-pi-sky
* **New "plots-spectrometry" mailing list** as our community continues to grow: We created a new list for spectrometry/spectral analysis discussions. Sign up here: https://groups.google.com/group/plots-spectrometry
* **Public Lab Barnraising** - planning continues as people sign up for the 2012 Public Lab barnraising in Louisiana. We're now brainstorming sessions for this upcoming "unconference" at the start of November: http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/2012-barnraising-cocodrie-la
* **"iPhotometer 5" release video** - continuing outreach for the DIY Spectrometer Kickstarter campaign includes a spoof iPhone 5 video introducing a "steampunk spectrometer" made of brass, brushed aluminum, and laser-engraved wood. It's silly but fun; watch the video! http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jywarren/public-lab-diy-spectrometry-kit/posts/310865
* **Safe H2S generation planning** - Jack Summers has posted some initial details on a plan to make an H2S test chamber for testing the various approaches to H2S sensing Public Labbers have been developing. Read more: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/publiclaboratory/mpACbWb3t-s
* **Intensity calibration for spectrometers** - the much-needed ability to take quantitative measurements with the PLOTS spectrometer is in the brainstorming stage; an active conversation was started by Tom H here: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/tomh/9-19-2012/intensity-calibration
* **MakerFaire NYC** - Some Public Lab folks are planning to attend [MakerFaire](http://makerfaire.com/) next weekend, and may have some space at the FarmHack tent. More details soon -- it'd be great to meet other folks and we're starting to think about a short trip to the Gowanus Canal for sediment sample-taking for spectrometry. (jeff@publiclaboratory.org)
* Drupal admins and devs needed for main PublicLaboratory site upkeep! Please contact web@publiclaboratory.org. We need help with spam moderation, page locking, and design issues.
