# Hand-cut or lasercut a simple DIY microscope stage

We're working on simpler and cheaper ways to make good DIY microscopes, working from this @partsandcrafts recommendation -- on this Hackteria page: [https://hackteria.org/wiki/Laser-cut\_microscopy\_stages#LifePatch\_DIY\_WebCam\_Microscope\_Stage](https://hackteria.org/wiki/Laser-cut_microscopy_stages#LifePatch_DIY_WebCam_Microscope_Stage)

Following up on [this post](/questions/warren/03-12-2018/looking-for-a-simple-diy-microscope-stage-design-with-parallel-plates), we'd like to use the same shape for both plates to simplify things, and I was able to drill holes in 2 plates of acrylic with a power drill:

I used a 5/16" bit and a 3/4" paddle bit to cut these, on a drill press, but you could do it with a hand drill too if you clamp things down well.

I also like this because you could do it with wood or masonite as well, pretty easily, although we may ultimately lasercut these.

## Files

Here are the lasercut files, including one we prepared for [Ponoko.com](http://Ponoko.com), although that ended up being ~$18 per pair of plates, so not at all affordable!

We used 6" long, 1/4"-20 bolts and plastic wingnuts to assemble it, and actually skipped the springs from the above design for simplicity. This worked with just a $3 webcam double-sided-foam-taped to [the microscope adapter we're using from the OpenFlexure Microscope project](/questions/bronwen/03-09-2018/help-the-kits-initiative-launch-the-basic-microscope-kit-by-3d-printing-lens-adaptors)!![image description](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/024/651/large/IMG_20180417_170228.jpg "IMG_20180417_170228.jpg")

And remarkably, we're able to clearly photograph 2 micron wide ruler markings! Faster, cheaper, better, stronger! (well, maybe not stronger)
