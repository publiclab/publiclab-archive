# How can nitrogen/nitrates/ammonia be measured?

I'm copying this information from [the Common Water Contaminants page](/common-water-contaminants), but would love to learn more ways to measure nitrogen as well; please help us compile different techniques!

## Assaying Nitrogen

The wet lab [Kjeldahl Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kjeldahl_method) is often used to get the measurement TKN, or Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen.

[EPA Method 353.2](http://water.epa.gov/scitech/methods/cwa/bioindicators/upload/2007_07_10_methods_method_353_2.pdf) involves a cobalt catalyst and spectroscopy in the visible range.

### UV Spectroscopy

### Potentiometric Measurements of Nitrate and Ammonium using Ion Selective Electrodes

Ion selective electrodes (discussed [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_selective_electrode)) can be used to conveniently measure ammonium and nitrate. These electrodes behave similarly to commonly used pH electrodes. The main difference between a pH electrode and an ion selective electrode (ISE) is that the former has a glass surface that is electrically polarized by protons and the latter has a membrane that is responsive to the ion in question. Like a pH electrode, an ion selective electrode responds to changes in analyte concentration by a measurable change in voltage. Ion selective electrodes can be measured with most pH meters. These electrodes can be purchased from a variety of sources (VWR, Fisher, etc) but are somewhat more expensive than pH electrodes. Vernier sells ammonium and nitrate sensitive electrodes ([here](http://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/ion-selective-electrodes/)) for $179 each.
