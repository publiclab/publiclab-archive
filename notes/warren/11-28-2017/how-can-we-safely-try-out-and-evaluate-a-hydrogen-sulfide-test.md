There are a few different methods being tested out for detecting hydrogen sulfide, and given that it's toxic, how can we validate these as part of our process of developing & refining them?

I suspect there's a lot of ideas and clues buried in this research from over the years: #hydrogen-sulfide

  
I'd guess we need a known source of H2S -- and a safe way to interact with it.
