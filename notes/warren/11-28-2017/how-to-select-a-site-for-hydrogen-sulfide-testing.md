I'm interested in some guidance or support materials for choosing a good site to do hydrogen sulfide detection, either using an established method or a Do-It-Yourself method. I've heard from people who live near wells (in Rifle, Colorado, for example) that the gas is heavier than air and collects in lower areas. How does this affect site selection? 

  
What about wind, light, etc? What are other considerations?
