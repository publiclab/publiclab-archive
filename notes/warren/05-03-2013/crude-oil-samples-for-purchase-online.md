While we definitely want to be testing crude samples from known oil spills, having reference samples is also important to testing for petroleum contamination. This company (http://onta.com/) sells small vials of different types of crude oil which you can buy online. I haven't ordered any yet but would love to [compare laser or UV fluorescence](/notes/warren/10-1-2012/ultraviolet-fluorescence-bp-oil-residue-and-olive-oil) with this vs. one of our samples.

The "basic oil" set is only $5, or ~$10 shipped!
