Quick update; we've completely revised the assembly instructions for the [Desktop Spectrometry Kit](http://shop.breadpig.com/products/desktop-spectrometry-kit) as a folded 1 page brochure-style printout (still letter-sized & monochrome!) with great new line art and 6 simple steps. It includes the CERN Open Hardware License and a list of contributors on the back, and uses the 1" conduit body from the latest design. Download it here:

###Rigid "backpack" spectrometer sketches

Also, for the February (fingers crossed) shipment of rigid plastic spectrometer attachments for smartphones, we're starting to think about case design, considering:

* the ability to mount it rigidly on a stand
* adaptability to different phones
* ruggedness and outdoor-proofing

Expect updates soon!
