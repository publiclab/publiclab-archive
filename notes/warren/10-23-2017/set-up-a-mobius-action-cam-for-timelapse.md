The Mobius Action Cam is used in the [Infragram Point & Shoot](/wiki/infragram-point-shoot), and also for lightweight aerial photography such as in the [Mini Kite Kit](/wiki/mini-kite-kit) and [Mini Balloon Kit](/wiki/mini-kite-kit). It can also be used for [timelapse](/wiki/timelapse) [photo monitoring](/wiki/photo-monitoring) of any kind; this activity shows how to set it up. These instructions are based on a post by @abdul.

### Software

Manually setting the config file is not hard, but there are now also programs to guide you through the process automatically, (thanks to @cfastie and @patcoyle for [finding these](https://publiclab.org/questions/patcoyle/11-08-2014/initial-results-and-timelapse-mode-issue-pl-mobius-infragram-point-and-shoot#answer-0-comment-10723)!)

If you're going to do it yourself manually, read on!

---------

To upload a new config file (SYSCFG.TXT) onto the Mobius camera, [follow the instructions here](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-23-2017/change-the-white-balance-or-other-configuration-on-a-mobius-camera).

---------

To set the camera to Timelapse mode, you'll need to follow the above instructions for uploading a custom config file; you can use this one to have a 2-second timelapse, or tweak the `Set Time Lapse Shooting` line for an interval you prefer: [__ SYSCFG.TXT](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/005/225/original/SYSCFG.TXT)

To start timelapse mode:

1. Turn on the camera
2. Press **M** twice to enter Photo Mode
3. Press the shutter button (__) to start the timer, and look for the blinking red light:
