A few fellow staff members asked me to do a survey of different platforms available for storing, managing, and sharing environmental data, as well as for doing analysis; after a lot of storyboarding to develop different in-depth specifications, I began organizing a list of existing software to see how well it met these needs.

While this is a really broad set of questions, I tried to develop a set of features which folks at Public Lab might need for specific cases. I also had a lot of great input from other staff in compiling this set of needs, so thanks!

I also only looked at programs that would (ideally) not take programming skills to use, although one exception was Phant -- because the (unfinished) [Grapherate prototype](https://github.com/jywarren/grapherate/) was designed as a front-end for it.

The software I looked are:

- [photosynq.org](http://photosynq.org/)
- [isenseproject.org](http://isenseproject.org/)
- [codap.concord.org](http://codap.concord.org/)
- [phant.io](http://phant.io/)
- [plot.ly](http://plot.ly/)

### Software

Here they are! Please leave a comment if there are others you'd like to add, and any help in actually filling in the details, or in correcting mistakes, is welcome. For some of these it wasn't easy to say yes or no, but I took notes on my best attempt. Also, for some of these the answers may change as the software continues to be improved!
