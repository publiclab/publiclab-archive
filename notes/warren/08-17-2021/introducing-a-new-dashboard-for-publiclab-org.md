# Introducing a new Dashboard for PublicLab.org

After two years of design and development, with extensive input from Public Lab staff, community, and a TON of hard work by our code community -- especially @ruthnwaiganjo (:tada:) - we're launching the new Public Lab dashboard, officially the 4th major dashboard revision we've done since 2010. 

If you haven't seen it already, please check out https://publiclab.org/dashboard (login is required)

The old dashboard will still be available for some time at https://publiclab.org/v1/dashboard, and there is a permanent place for the "all posts" feed at https://publiclab.org/research.

#### Topics  

The biggest change is that the dashboard is re-organized around topical areas, rather than individual posts. That means you see a list of the topics you follow, sorted by recency.   

#### Geography

The second big change is the visibility of the mapping features of Public Lab, which, if you enter your location, will show you content near you, as shown in the lead image.   

There are also still some refinements coming, including a more image-rich view. 

A ton of other changes, refinements, and paradigm shifts are baked into here, all of which came out of extensive consultation with Public Lab staff and community. I'd like to especially thank @ruthnwaiganjo for bringing this vision to life through her Outreachy fellowship, and to thank [Outreachy](http://outreachy.org/ "http://outreachy.org/") for the incredible support they've shown for our community.
