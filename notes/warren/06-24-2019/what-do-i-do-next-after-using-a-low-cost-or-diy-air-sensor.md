What would be a good next step after using a Simple Air Sensor ( #simple-air-sensor) or another DIY air sensor like the #dustduino? The activities listed on the Simple Air Sensor are interesting, but there are many things it can't do as well. After using one, should people:

* try a different sensor?
* try using more sensors? (more expensive, or [different types](/air-sensors)?)
* try logging or collecting data? ( #data-logging)
* work to building a team or find collaborators?
* start designing a study? ( #study-design)

What other ways forward do people recommend?
