Rough sketch (more full design to follow) for a black paper insert for Type-AB conduits boxes. This will reduce reflections inside the box and we can probably make a folding angled support for the webcam to point at the right angle (not a right angle -- say, roughly 30-45Â°). 

I need to fold some paper to make this work, then upload a vector design for this. I was going to use some of the geometry [from ToF's design](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/tof/9-9-2012/designing-spectrometer-1nm-range-10-part-1).
