In follow-up to the question @stevie posted about cleaning datasets, I had a related one -- when I tried to post a CSV file (essentially a spreadsheet), I found it had too many columns to be very readable. When it graphed, there was just too much information. 

  
I tried deleting a few columns but it wasn't ideal... What are common ways to deal with this?
