Quick roundup of new features and improvements:

###SpectralWorkbench.org

Changes to SpectralWorkbench have been varied; a really obvious one is on the front page (which you must be logged out to see), pictured above -- we are now showing 4 "featured" tags for different interesting things to scan, to encourage people to try things beyond the basics, and give folks an idea of what things **should** look like.

A blitz of wiki page edits has also resulted in new pages for: 

* [Spectrometry activities](/wiki/spectrometry-activities)
* [Spectrometry sampling](/wiki/spectrometry-sampling) guide including tips for water, oil, and flame spectrometry
* A "[flare spectroscopy activity](/wiki/flare-spectroscopy-activity)" simulating gas refinery flare monitoring, but doable in a classroom, using a candle and a spray bottle of salt water.

These pages are now better-represented on the dashboard:

A [new stats page](https://spectralworkbench.org/stats) shows some exciting stats about contributions: 1600+ contributors and over 10k spectra!

###PublicLab.org

A slew of changes have hit PublicLab.org too -- one nice one is that user profile pages now list wiki page contributions, and also display a graph of research note posting over the past 52 weeks:

The [improved Stats page](/stats) also shows such graphs for the whole community:

There are also stats available on contributor pages (linked to from the tag pages) for contributors who've posted content with the given tag. See how "infragram" post have grown since the launch of that project:

Lots of other small improvements abound but these are some of the more exciting & fun ones. Thanks to [Bryan](/profile/btbonval) and [Dogi](/profile/nemo), and to all of you for sticking with us as these sites progress! Special thanks to those who've [documented bugs on Github](/wiki/issues), as well.
