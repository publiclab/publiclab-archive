<i>Ken writes:</i> At the GeoDesign conference in San Diego we heard mention of folks at MIT using helium balloons with cameras attached to take aerial pictures.  Thinking this was a fabulous idea I decided to find out more and see if this was a technique we could easily incorporate into our projects.

The MIT connection turned out to be the  <a href="http://civic.mit.edu/">MIT Center for Future Civic Media</a> and their partnership with others to create <a title="Grassroots Mapping Website" href="http://grassrootsmapping.org" target="_blank">Grassroots Mapping</a>, a project and resource site to encourage citizens to use these balloons to generate maps of communities and their surrounding environment.

One application highlighted on the website is Gulf coast communities <a title="Using helium balloons to document oil spill" href="http://grassrootsmapping.org/gulf-oil-spill/" target="_blank">using the balloons to observe and report on last year's BP oil spill</a>.  From Grassroots Mapping emerged <a title="The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (PLOTS)" href="http://publiclaboratory.org" target="_blank">the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (PLOTS)</a> which represents network of scientists and activists experimenting with accessible technologies for  investigating and reporting on local environmental health and justice  issues. PLOTS is a great example of an online platform bringing together citizens, scientists, social scientists, and technologists to collaboratively solve problems.

We too see a number of ways we could integrate balloon launches into our work including adding a bird’s eye perspective to our <a title="Video of Community Walkshops" href="http://vimeo.com/17826840" target="_blank">Walkshops</a> or providing a unique medium for place-based art projects.  The 3 minute video at the top of this blog documents our first balloon launch. Grassroots Mapping's  downloadable instructions on <a title="Helium Balloon Instructions" href="http://grassrootsmapping.org/guide/" target="_blank">how to build your own helium balloon camera</a> made the job easy.

At the time, we did not have a digital camera with the functionality of taking continuous pictures so I put huge faith into our knots and fishing line and sent up my iPhone in video mode.  Since then we have acquired a <a title="GoPro Sports Camera" href="http://gopro.com" target="_blank">GoPro sports camera</a> that is capable of taking video or time-lapse pictures.  The GoPro has the added advantage of having a wide angle lens. Total cost for our first balloon launch was $165, with the rental of the helium tank and the purchase of a 6 ft diameter balloon being the dominant expenses.  The tank had enough helium for two launches.
