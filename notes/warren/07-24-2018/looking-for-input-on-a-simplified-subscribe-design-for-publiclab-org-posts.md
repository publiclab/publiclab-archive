We're in the midst of a broader design overhaul for this very website -- PublicLab.org (read more at #ui) -- but we're also looking to get more people **subscribing to follow topics** (tags) on the site. 

  
As we're moving tags to the upper right, [in this issue](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/3127), we'll have a chance to redesign what happens at the end of a post (see [this example post](https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/04-30-2018/what-are-your-thoughts-on-this-initial-sketch-for-a-tag-page-on-publiclab-org)). Right now it's a little busy, but once tags are gone, maybe we could consolidate the social media stuff (which is looking a bit dated) and a line prompting people to \`Subscribe\` to stay up to date? Then go right into comments. 

  
Currently it looks like:

But what about something like this?
