# Wine spectroscopy with Adam Hasler

Adam brought a number of wines which we measured in one of our [DIY spectrometers](/tool/spectrometer), and tasted, too. He described the background of each wine and its place of origin, and we spent some time discussing how to improve readings and sample prep for this early stage prototype instrument.

Here are some of the readings:

* Control - https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/66
* 2009 santa barbara pinot noir: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/68
* 2009 clos de vaulicheres epineuil: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/69
* 2010 simfebvre_sauvblanc: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/70
* 2010 talmardchardonnay: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/71
* 2010 honig sauvblanc: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/72
* 2010 riffualt sancerre: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/73
