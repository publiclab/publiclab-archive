If we want to use "normal sized" party balloons, which we'll say are less than 1 foot wide, how many would it take to lift a camera? Of course, there are different balloon types (mylar, rubber) and different camera types (gopro, #pi-camera, and bigger). But what are some combinations people have tried that work? I heard from someone that:

> Well we put 35 balloons -- 35!!! -- and they would not lift the little camera! At least the first 30 were from the Dollar Store, so $30... but the last five were from the grocery store at $3.99 each, so we spent almost $50 on party balloons and it still wouldn't work.

What are some numbers to help here?
