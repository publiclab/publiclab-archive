This week, we wrapped up our 2019 Outreachy and Google Summer of Code with the largest team of fellows ever -- 15, with two joining via Outreachy and 13 via GSoC. We also had our most successful summer ever, with a huge number of amazing projects and some incredible collaborations. 

(above, a picture from [an amazing event](https://publiclab.org/notes/divyabaid16/08-19-2019/public-lab-outreach-event-jaipur) organized in Jaipur by @divyabaid16 about GSoC and Public Lab's first-timers-only work!)

This past Tuesday, we had an extra-long [OpenHour](/openhour) (2-hours, actually) and folks got to give short presentations on their projects.You can watch them here on YouTube!

One thing I noted was that we had much more collaborative work this summer than in the past, with multiple 2-person teams working in close concert with each other, as well as a number of different bigger teams coordinating in parallel and across major integration projects -- [MapKnitter being the biggest example of this](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-26-2019/community-atlas-an-around-the-world-collaboration-on-mapknitter)!

I think this speaks to how we've grown as a community and developed strong cooperative practices! I also wanted to high-five everyone for [opening MANY first-timers-only issues](https://code.publiclab.org), and inviting many newcomers into their projects. It shows great leadership, and was crucial to the success of the summer's projects. 

Overall, I was super impressed, and wanted to offer a big CONGRATULATIONS to everyone who participated: students/interns/fellows, mentors, and also all the newcomers who came and joined in on these projects.

Here are everyone's final reports. And again, GREAT WORK!!! :tada: :tada: :tada: :tada:
