# Coqui draft board design on Upverter

###What I want to do

Make a simple through-hole Printed Circuit Board for the [Coqui](/wiki/coqui) <$5 water conductivity sensor.

###My attempt and results

I don't really know how to do circuit layout but I attempted on Upverter.com:

###Questions and next steps

I'm tempted to just order this and see if it works. It's like the one Katie and I did on a blank PCB:

But I'd love it if someone checked my work. 

###Why I'm interested

Let more people make Coquis simply and cheaply!
