    NEW WHISTLEBLOWER WESBITE PROMISES TRANSPARENCY IN APPALACHIA<br>
    <br>
    CHARLESTON, WV — Today marks the launch of Honest Appalachia, a new
    website designed<br>
    to empower whistleblowers throughout Appalachia. According to a
    description on its website,<br>
    Honest Appalachia is a secure website meant to assist and protect
    whistleblowers who wish to<br>
    reveal proof of corporate and government wrongdoing to citizens
    throughout the region.<br>
    <br>
    Whistleblowers will be able to upload documents to the Honest
    Appalachia website using security<br>
    technology that will keep their identity hidden, even in the face of
    legal action. Project organizers<br>
    plan to work with local journalists to analyze and publish the
    information they receive.<br>
    <br>
    From coal and gas companies to banks and zoning boards to local and
    state governments, the<br>
    organization says it wants to hold institutions accountable and help
    make Appalachia a more<br>
    transparent place.<br>
    <br>
    “We believe our country desperately needs watchdogs at the local,
    state and regional level, and<br>
    our website has stepped in to help fill the gap,” a statement on the
    project’s website said. “We are<br>
    committed to being objective and professional in our presentation of
    the documents and<br>
    information we receive from whistleblowers.”<br>
    <br>
    Honest Appalachia has been in development for a year and is being
    operated by a team of<br>
    computer scientists, freelance journalists and transparency
    activists in Appalachia and beyond. It is<br>
    funded by a seed grant from the Sunlight Foundation, a government
    transparency group based in<br>
    Washington D.C., as well as by private donations.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to its work with whistleblowers, the organization will
    provide assistance to other<br>
    individuals and groups who are working on similar projects. Honest
    Appalachia, which was<br>
    inspired by international transparency organizations like Wikileaks,
    is designed as a low-cost<br>
    replicable model that can be adapted to other regions around the
    country and the world.<br>
    <br>
    “We believe the world has too many secrets for one website,” said
    the project’s organizers, in a<br>
    written statement online.<br>
