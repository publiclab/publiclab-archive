A new idea that evolved [in this thread](https://github.com/Pioneer-Valley-Open-Science/infragram-js/issues/14) -- use the **hue, saturation, value** color model to generate colormaps directly with Infragrammar. While this idea is not fully developed and has had some good criticisms from Ben, I thought this proof of concept was interesting enough to continue exploring. 

I used this expression in the HUE field of the HSV input (i tweaked it a bit until it seemed to use an attractive span of the color wheel):

`((R-B)/(R+B)-0.5)*-360`

It accepts a color value from 0-360, and allows for negative values, it seems, like -180, since it's really just an angle on this kind of color wheel:

I used a maximum value of 1 for each of **Saturation** and **Value**. That resulted in this fairly nice image:

Compare that with the build-in colormapping function Ben implemented:
