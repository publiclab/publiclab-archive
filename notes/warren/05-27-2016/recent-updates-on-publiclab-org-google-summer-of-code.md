Hi, all - I wanted to summarize some of the recent activity by PublicLab.org code contributors, which you may notice around the site, and also recap some of what this summer's Google Summer of Code students have tackled so far in their first week.

### Updates

Thanks to all who've submitted changes in the past two weeks! They were just published to the site, including:

* "flag" icons more consistent for navbar searches (see below)
* new Talk pages for wiki, at new URLs ([test this out!](/talk/developers))
* [the research page](/research) now uses new styles from the new dashboard redesign

And thanks especially for the folks who posted and built out those feature requests; they were welcoming and clear, and that goes a long way towards making features and fixes easier for someone to take on. Learn how to [add your own proposals and make them welcoming here](/wiki/developers#Contributing+for+non-coders).

### GSoC

Student Richard Meister, on [the WebJack project](/notes/rmeister/03-24-2016/browser-based-arduino-sensor-data-transfer-using-webrtc-and-headphone-jack), reports:

> I spent the week with research about AFSK modems and figured out what the SoftModem library actually does. Also I've read the code of modem.js to judge if it suits our needs (it probably does not, I'll post a research note or open a separate thread later).

Student Lalith Rallabhandi, on the [Rich Profiles project](/notes/Lalithr95/03-23-2016/rich-profile-tags-and-improving-the-performance-of-publiclab-org), reports: 

> Database structure was the crucial part of the application. I created a rails model for Usertag and wrote basic unit tests to get started. Next would be setup the controller and implementation of views.

Other students, please post a sentence about your progress here, and link to recent updates on Github or your own posts if you like!
