I've been working with Cort on final parts lists and a final design for the [countertop spec](/wiki/spectrometer-materials), and found some nice light sockets and base box combos today. Just wanted to post a quick update; that's it!

Also, Brad/ChemistryDude is doing a lot of work to make sure the mobile phone attachment will be 3d printable and also injection moldable; he sent a print over and it looks great. I'm hoping he'll do a research note with more detail, but just wanted to include at least a photo:
