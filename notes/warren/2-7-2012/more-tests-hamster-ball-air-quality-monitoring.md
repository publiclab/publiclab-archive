I got the "robotic hamster ball" working and moving very slowly by gearing down a Lego motor and using its battery pack as a weight. Issues:

* it's not super reliable - it gets stuck and makes a "clicking" noise
* it move so slowly that it is jerky in its motions
* it's not balanced well so it tends to go in circles
* it's hard to turn on and off because the button is hard to reach while it's moving
