Several people have been interested in an "annotated maps" feature for MapKnitter and the PLOTS archive. It seems like there are a few possible next steps. 

* [on Github](https://github.com/jywarren/plots/issues/131#issuecomment-5726310), I proposed making a stand-alone annotation system which we could embed in the PLOTS archive or MapKnitter
* the Gigapans made by [Chris Fastie](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/5-8-2012/stitched-panoramas-plots-ir-camera-tool) and [Stewart Long](http://gigapan.com/gigapans/69999) are good demonstrations of what a more map-specific annotation system could look like (auto panning, embeddable)
* we've long discussed just doing screencasts where two people discuss and "walk through" a map on a laptop while recording the screen and audio, and posting on YouTube
* it seems like [Zeega.org](http://zeega.org) may offer some features along these lines when it launches

Anyhow, I wanted to kick off some discussion on next steps. We could try all of the above, or a hybrid. But I keep saying "oh, these other folks are interested in this too" and never connecting people, so here goes.
