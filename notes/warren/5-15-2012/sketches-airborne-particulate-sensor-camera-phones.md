Was in D-Lab Biodiversity class today at MIT and brainstormed an idea fora laser-and-webcam or laser-and-smartphone particulate sensor using 2 mirrors, a black box, a laser pointer, and a video camera.

More on this soon, i hope... maybe a prototype. We could just use Spectral Workbench for starters.
