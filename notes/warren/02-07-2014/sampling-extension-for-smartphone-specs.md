[Mathew Lippincott](/profile/mathew) and I have been talking about the [Oil Sampling Kit](/notes/warren/02-04-2014/oil-testing-kit-draft-materials-list) and how to streamline it eventually for mobile use. The [Smartphone Spec](http://store.publiclab.org/products/smartphone-spectrometer) is designed to accept "expansion packs" and this seemed a good opportunity to develop one which we could prototype 3d-print. It could:

* include built-in lighting
* accept 2 sample containers; a sample and a control
* have completely fixed geometry between the lighting and the samples
* use UV LEDs instead of a blue laser, and
* include a battery and different lights inside the enclosure

Interesting! So I made a quick Sketchup model (attached) pictured above. It's not to scale or ready to print or anything, but I'm just trying to figure out a good orientation and internal layout.

Above, see how the 2 cuvettes are separated by a wall. The "foot" at the back left inserts into the end of the smartphone spec. I've left a cutaway so you can see the inside.

Can you improve this design? Make it printable?
