I'm getting ready to code a bugfix for auto-detecting which end of your spectrum is the "blue" and which is the "red", and as a half-way step i added RGB mode -- that is, a display for what each set of color sensors is seeing. This is very helpful for checking if your spectra is overexposed. See below and in the gallery.
