Been working on sketches for possible illustrated guides and also generally to explain how to use a thermal flashlight. Below, a parts list sketch. For the below sketch, I have [a version in Google Presentations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aL_7crXbEaR3gcNO9AlAFapraZHXwRGSow7QFw3C8Tg/edit) which has labels and rough pricing. I tried to highball the prices to be as conservative as possible.
