The website for [PurpleAir](https://www.purpleair.com
) (and the [Wunderground page](https://www.wunderground.com/sensors/purpleair) for it) speak very highly of it:

> Using a new generation of laser particle counters to provide real time measurement of (amongst other data), PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10. PurpleAir sensors are easy to install, requiring a power outlet and WiFi. They use WiFi to report in real time to the PurpleAir Map.

They seem to range from $179-$259 and detect:

> PurpleAir sensors use a fan to draw air past a laser, causing reflections from any particles in the air. These reflections are used to count particles in six sizes between 0.3μm and 10μm diameter.
> Using one second particle counts, estimated total mass for PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10 is averaged by the PurpleAir Internet of Things (IOT) control board.

How well do these relate to health effects, or regulated air quality measurements? What are the pros/cons?
