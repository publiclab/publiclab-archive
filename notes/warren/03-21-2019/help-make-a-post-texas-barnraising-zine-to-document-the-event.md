Hi all, and especially folks who were at the Texas Barnraising! 

  
At the event we mentioned our plan to create a collaboratively written zine to document the ideas, discussions, and projects from the event. We've decided to start this process off with a shared Google Presentation, where we've started adding lots of photos, session topics, and notes.   

  
### Add to the Google Doc!  

We've made it so anyone can add content to this draft; please do! 

  
> [Click here to start editing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qh5-s25ySh-joVj4J21i2K_v0qSl3UWtEIrY0KB6184/edit#slide=id.g385bd11f7d_0_46)

  
Add your name so we can see what everyone's added in, and don't sweat the formatting too much for now; we're going to scrap-book it for a bit to build up ideas, then we'll do some editing and design work later.   

We're looking for:  

- Report-ins from sessions
- Project ideas or summaries
- Stories or anecdotes
- Drawings, photos, or diagrams
- Screenshots of social media
- ...surprise us!

  
### Materials

There's plenty of material to work with; we've pasted a lot into there already, including every single session idea that was on the board!  

You can find photos on this post: [https://publiclab.org/n/18409](https://publiclab.org/n/18409)   

And notes from the event on this page: [https://publiclab.org/doccom](https://publiclab.org/doccom)
