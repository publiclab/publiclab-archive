**New features on PublicLab.org:** A research note is forthcoming, but you may notice lots of small changes and tweaks -- as well as some brief trouble posting research notes on Friday night (thankfully resolved!). Changes include [a new tags page](/maps/tag/barataria) and a [new overall contributors page](/contributors).

**The plots-dev list -- for programmers interested in Public Lab software projects** -- has been growing enormously, and is now close to 50 members. Contributions from new folks on this list has been key to the ongoing progress on our various websites! http://publiclab.org/wiki/developers
