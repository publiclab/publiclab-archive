### Outreachy and GSoC

We're part of two different summer fellowship programs this year, [Outreachy](https://outreachy.org) and [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (#GSoC) -- both recruit software contributors to work on open source projects. We may also join [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) (#RGSoC) once it opens, but would need to be accepted first.

We've done GSoC for a few years now, and are really excited to be part of RGSoC for a third year and Outreachy for a second season. Outreachy writes:

> We expressly invite women (both cis and trans), trans men, and genderqueer people to apply. We also expressly invite applications from residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, Native American/American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander. Anyone who faces under-representation, systemic bias, or discrimination in the technology industry of their country is invited to apply.

So, we're asking students **from both programs** to start posting their proposals for comment, here. Read on!  

### Deadlines

Outreachy's application deadline is the March 26, 2019 at 4pm UTC. GSoC applications will be open between March 25, 2019 - April 9, 2019.

### Read proposal ideas

Once you've gotten a bit familiar with our project (see **[our welcome page here](https://code.publiclab.org/#r=all)**), the first step is to look over **our ideas page, [which you can find here](/wiki/gsoc-ideas#Ideas)**. These were collected from [the brainstorm we did earlier in the year](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-02-2019/brainstorming-for-summer-of-code-2019). 

For Outreachy, we will be posting a project idea soon on the Outreachy website. 

Please feel free to ask questions in the comments below, or to join our chat channel at [https://publiclab/chat](https://publiclab/chat)

Our welcoming page will help you understand how we collaborate, and we'll be there to help you take your first step. And [try tackling a first-timers-only issue](https://code.publiclab.org/#r=all), to get an idea of how to become a contributor!

Also, **read this page carefully** to understand our workflow and how we structure  summer of code projects: https://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc#How+we+work

Please ask questions! We're very friendly and we love welcoming new people into our community.

### New this year

Once the term starts, we'll be asking all participants to review another person's work at least once time per week, and to either post a first-timers-only issue or help someone who's working on one once weekly. This will help us continue to support our growing community!


### Post a proposal for comment

Once you've read through some of these ideas and become a bit more familiar with our projects, it's time to post a proposal of your own.

**You don't need to have a complete or even concrete idea** -- share your thoughts early and we'll help you refine your proposal, and help you choose something that's the right difficulty level as well as being something our project really needs.

We've created a template for you to post a proposal here. Click this button to begin:
