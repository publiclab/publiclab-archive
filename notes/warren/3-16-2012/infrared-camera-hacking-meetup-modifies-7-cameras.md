The group infrared camera conversion meetup in Somerville last night went really well; we got through 11 cameras, 7 of which were modifiable (the rest had too much glue on the final screws, and we left them unmodified).

7:4 is not a bad ratio and bodes well for folks who order 2 Canon A495s with the hope that they'll be able to successfully modify at least one of them. Thanks to Pablo, Chuck and Guido for their help!

For those who missed, it, the video walk-through of the conversion is still available on the [near-infrared camera page](/tool/near-infrared-camera).
