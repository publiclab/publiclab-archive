I flew back from Colorado via Philly and took lots of [Infragram](http://kck.st/11XOglZ) photos the whole way. Here are some of the best... they look amazing! Some worked better than others; the golf course didn't work well at all. Also - i'm not sure if the gradient in the first and third ones is due to overall brightness or perhaps due to scattering in the blue channel from air moisture...
