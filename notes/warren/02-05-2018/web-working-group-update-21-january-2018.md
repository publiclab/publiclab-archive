# Web Working Group Update 21: January 2018

We've had a **pretty wild month** in our software contributor community. After an [already busy December](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-12-2018/an-amazing-week-of-software-contributing-at-public-lab), a group of contributors has stepped up to really become leaders in our software collaborations -- tackling large new features, welcoming newcomers, and helping to review and support one anothers' contributions. 

(This is the first Web Working Group update in a little while, because I've been writing blog posts and other smaller updates instead)

For some numbers from the past 30 days:

> Excluding merges, **26 authors have pushed 147 commits**. 348 files have changed and there have been [50,994 additions and 3,000 deletions](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/compare/master@%7B1515162318%7D...master).

### More outreach

We've applied to both Rails Girls Summer of Code (which **we were accepted to**!) and Google Summer of Code for 2018, both of which were great for us this past summer; we've also reached out to new first-timer-friendly websites like [https://github.com/Roshanjossey/first-contributions/](https://github.com/Roshanjossey/first-contributions/) to help get the word out that we're here and we're welcoming newcomers!

Our Community Toolbox project has also really helped -- newcomers are now welcomed to tackle projects across Public Lab coding projects, not just on [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org) -- and due to all our awesome new leaders, we have a steady supply of `first-timers-only` issues for them to take on:

### More organizing

To better facilitate this fantastic growth, we've been continuing our Software Outreach blog series, this month with [a post on modularity](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-18-2018/software-outreach-modularity-is-great-for-collaboration) -- a key to breaking up big projects into small pieces that newcomers can tackle. Expect more on this soon -- [we'll also be at LibrePlanet this March](https://libreplanet.org/2018/) to talk about our work in this space.

### Tackling design

Finally, a big area of growth is design work -- we don't have nearly the community, peer-to-peer process for interface design that we do for coding, and we're seeing a growing need for **good UI/UX design** that we can tackle in a similar workflow -- engaging newcomers, working in small self-contained projects, and quick iteration. To this end, we've started posting some questions to the site:

### New features

There's really not enough space to list out all the new features we've seen go up this month -- dozens of them -- but I'll just mention that [our new People page](/people) -- incorporating a huge amount of work on geographic features -- is now live. See screenshot below!

That's it for this month -- thanks!
