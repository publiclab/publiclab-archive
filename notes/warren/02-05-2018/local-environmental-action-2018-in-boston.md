**Saturday, March 3rd 2018 at the Curry Student Center at Northeastern University in Boston.**

  
This is a really great event that Public Lab folks have attended each year -- I'm going to be traveling in Wisconsin to work with some of our community partners on frac sand issues, but it's a fantastic event with representatives from local action groups all over -- pipelines, pesticide work, grassroots organizing, etc. -- I really recommend it!
