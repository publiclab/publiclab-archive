Google Code-In [winners were just announced](https://codein.withgoogle.com/winners/)! Congratulations to everyone, from our amazing mentors to the dozens of people who participated and made our community and project better!

> Pre-university students ages 13 to 17 are invited to take part in Google Code-in: Our global, online contest introducing teenagers to the world of open source development. With a wide variety of [bite-sized tasks](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/resources/example-tasks), it's easy for beginners to jump in and get started no matter what skills they have.
> 
> Mentors from our participating organizations lend a helping hand as participants learn what it's like to work on an open source project. Participants get to work on real software and win prizes from t-shirts to a trip to Google HQ!

While Google runs this as a contest, and we have selected winners and finalists (CONGRATULATIONS!), we think of programs like these as an important way to reach out to new contributors and community members, and the most important thing is that everyone had a good experience, learning new things and feeling welcome to be a part of this community.

So, a special thanks to those who worked hard to support each other and to make each other feel welcome.

And a special thanks to all the great energy from our mentors, many of whom worked long hours to respond to, support, and guide our GCI participants -- especially @bansal\_sidharth2996, but many others as well! It was actually the mentors' idea to apply to GCI this year and it has been a transformative project for our community. You can learn about how much activity happened in the past quarter by [reading our Code Community Update here](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-02-2019/public-lab-code-community-report-jan-2019).

If you weren't recognized as a finalist or winner, please know: we had SO MANY amazing people this year it was impossible to recognize everyone we needed to in this way. We are so lucky to be working with each of you, and look forward to continuing to collaborate! :tada:
