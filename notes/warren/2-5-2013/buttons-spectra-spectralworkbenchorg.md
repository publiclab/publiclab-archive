I spent some time today implementing a basic "like" function so you can mark your favorite spectra (and big up your fellow DIY spectral investigators). We'll hopefully be implementing this on the [upcoming new Public Lab website](/wiki/plots2), so it was a good chance to try writing such a feature. (Both sites are written in Ruby on Rails).

Try it out and don't miss the [Popular spectra](https://spectralworkbench.org/popular) page, as spectra gain "likes"!

I Liked this one in particular: https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/913
