Following up on [this recent post](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/10-9-2012/spectrometry-kit-paper-insert-design-sketches). The black paper insert in the [DIY Spectrometry Kit](http://kickstarter.com/projects/jywarren/public-lab-diy-spectrometry-kit) will improve the design by reducing light leakage and reflection inside the "imaging chamber". I made a couple designs -- one which i cut out and sized, and a second which i adapted to make it fit on a smaller piece of card paper. The final ones will be of stiffer black cardstock, and we're hoping to lasercut the slits. 

The camera is held onto the wall with a piece of very sturdy double-sided foam tape. The only issue with this is that although I've been able to ensure that the USB cable can be unplugged from the camera back, it can be bent a bit and I worry that unless we firmly secure the cable, tugging on it will move the camera and ruin the calibration. Ideas?

Measurements coming soon, but at the bottom is a sketch with a ruler for scale. I'm still thinking about how to use the insert to help people correctly position the webcam. Also looking at [ToF's design on this post](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/tof/9-9-2012/designing-spectrometer-1nm-range-10-part-1) and will likely adopt more of his work as the design finalizes.

**Update:** I modified the design so it fits on a smaller piece of paper, and tried it out. Data at the bottom, photo of new design coming soon.
