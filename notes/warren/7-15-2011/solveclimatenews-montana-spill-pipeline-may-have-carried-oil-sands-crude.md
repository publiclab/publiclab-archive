<p>Montana Spill Pipeline May Have Carried Oil Sands Crude</p>
<p>&gt; An Exxon Mobil pipeline that ruptured, leaking oil into Yellowstone River, may have sometimes carried a heavier and more toxic form of crude than initially thought, federal regulators said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&gt; The U.S. Transportation Department&#39;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration spokeswoman Patricia Klinger said her office had learned that the pipeline may have been used to carry heavier crude.</p>

<p>&gt; Richard Opper, head of the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, said he was surprised to learn the pipeline buried in the streambed of the Yellowstone may sometimes have moved tar sands crude from Canada.</p>

<p>&gt; &quot;If the question is, did we know it was carrying tar sands oil? Hell, no,&quot; he said in an interview on Thursday. &quot;If companies are changing the kinds of materials in pipelines to mixes that make them more likely they will leak or rupture, that raises huge concerns.&quot;</p>
