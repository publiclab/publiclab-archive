Preparing for the next issue of the Grassroots Mapping Forum; I managed to very roughly place our Chandeleur Islands map from May 9, 2010 on a 2008 NAIP (USGS) aerial photo of the area. Sands shift so fast in this region... yikes. 

Anyways I'll get a web viewer up soon and then we'll be making decisions on how to frame this on the poster-sized Forum. If you're interested in getting involved, please email me or speak up on the mailing list.

**Update:**
