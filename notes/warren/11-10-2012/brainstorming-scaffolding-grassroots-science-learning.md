We talked today at Mozfest (Mozilla's open web festival in London) about science and the web -- and brainstormed this rough chart for how to engage folks with little science background in not only data collection, but the framing of research questions etc. I'll try to flesh this out a bit but it was an interesting session and got at a lot of the debate we've had recently about blackboxing to empower people vs. how blackboxing can obscure key understanding.
