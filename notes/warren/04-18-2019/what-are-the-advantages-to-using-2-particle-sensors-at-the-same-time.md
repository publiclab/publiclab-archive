Hi all, it makes sense that you get extra credibility/validity if you have 2 sensors (like the #plantower) and they agree (basically for any sensor!). But I wanted to try to break this down with as little jargon as possible -- are there other advantages? Does the Purple Air average the two, or how does it use the two data streams?

  
I also want to acknowledge that this has been addressed in parts in different questions at #purpleair and #plantower (and #simple-air-sensor) but it's come up from time to time, so I wanted to try to develop a simple answer in one place. Thank you all for helping make this information more accessible!
