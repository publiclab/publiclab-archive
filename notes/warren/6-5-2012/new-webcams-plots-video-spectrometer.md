I have been testing all kinds of cheap webcams for the next batch of video spectrometers (we've been sold out for a month, because the old webcams we used are no longer available in quantity or for the same low $7.50 price). I finally found one which seems perfect!

The above webcam (slightly destroyed, or shall we say, improved) is rectangular, so it sits solidly on the "floor" of the [video spectrometer](/tool/spectrometer). It is HD (720) and is easy to open (to remove the infrared filter, see the small disc of glass in the above photo) and only about $10 in bulk. I ordered 56 so we can make lots of kits, but it can be found here:

I've also been experimenting with a completely in-browser spectrometer client, and will post updates soon. But it can actually use the build-in camera on an Android webcam, directly from the browser. Will our spectrometer someday look like this?
