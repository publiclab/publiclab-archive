Max mentioned on [Open Hour](/openhour) that the color of the rope in making a #Babylegs trawl doesn't matter, but are there types of rope to watch out for that produce more microplastics that might contaminate the sample? Does using pink (or a color that matches the tights) help to identify such contamination if it gets in the samples? Or is just taping/melting the ends enough to control loose microplastics from the ends of the rope?

  
Thanks!
