I've been wondering if we can make the spectrometer camera mount better and more straightforward by building it all into the fold able paper insert, which would also fix the geometry of the interior of the device. Here's a rough attempt:

**Update:** Mathew makes a good point. 

What about just indicating very specifically where the angled block goes? Like this:
