This month's work was a bit sporatic (for me, at least) because of the Public Lab staff retreat and the following week's desperate catch-up. Still, lots of work has continued on Spectral Workbench, and there've been a few other highlights as well.

Many apologies for the late update this month! I was just too overwhelmed with post-retreat work to get this out the door until now.


##Systems administration

Sebastian Silva (@icarito), our sysadmin, has been hard at work tuning and optimizing our systems, and I've worked with him to push through a few fixes and changes, including:

* a fix for callouts, which is where in comments you can use @username syntax to ensure someone gets an email notification of your comment (this had been broken for some time, unfortunately!)
* a mix of small fixes for notification emails
* a [MapKnitter process optimization](https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/pull/198) which was tested last night, and seems to work (please report any exporting trouble you have)
* an upcoming mail server switch which we hope will resolve some of the issues with PL email going to some folks' spam inboxes

##Mapmill.org

Sebastian has also put up the long-awaited MapMill.org 2.0, although there's a remaning bug where uploading doesn't actually work (so it's not useful yet!) but we hope to have that resolved shortly and will announce then. 

##Spectral Workbench 2.0

Finally, LOTS of work has gone into a new calibration system for SWB 2.0, [as documented here](/notes/warren/09-30-2015/new-wavelength-calibration-procedure-preview-for-spectral-workbench-2-0), which has also led into a very interesting and productive discussion of calibration references, NIST, and [possible errors in Wikipedia's published fluorescent bulb reference](/notes/cfastie/10-06-2015/twin-peaks-tb-or-hg).

The calibration system and [a new root-mean-square-error based assessement metric](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/issues/209) for calibrations are big features which promise to improve accuracy and precision for everyone, while relating our data more explicitly to well-known external references like NIST. 

I've also begun to worry about how much longer this big upgrade is taking -- there've been plenty of distractions and urgent other work, but I also decided to move 12 issues into a 2.1 release, for some future date. 

Still remaining [in 2.0 and the graphing overhaul milestones](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/milestones) are 44 issues. Gosh, I hope I can get most of those done by the end of October, but I don't know.

Next up will be automated JavaScript testing -- this'll help speed development since I'll be able to tell if JavaScript changes are breaking any of the more complex systems which now exist only on the client side.
