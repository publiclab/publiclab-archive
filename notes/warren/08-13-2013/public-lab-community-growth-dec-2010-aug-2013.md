I occasionally go through our traffic tracking graphs on Google Analytics, and though this might be nice to share; we've had **366,744 people** visit the site since it launched in December 2010! The lead image is a graph of that traffic, by month. The larger spikes are in April 2012 [when Google announced they were republishing our balloon maps](http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2012/04/balloon-and-kite-imagery-in-google.html), and in September 2012 when [our DIY Spectrometry Kickstarter ran](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jywarren/public-lab-diy-spectrometry-kit) and was featured on Slashdot.

Some more stats:

* We've had visitors from 213 countries an in 206 languages
* Daily visits are approx 1000 per day, or over 7000 per week

You can also always view site statistics here: http://publiclab.org/stats

As of today:

* 1377 research notes have been posted by 197 contributors since over 2 years ago
* 554 wiki pages have been posted
* 10475 wiki page edits have been made

Great work, everyone, we've come a long way and are growing fast!
