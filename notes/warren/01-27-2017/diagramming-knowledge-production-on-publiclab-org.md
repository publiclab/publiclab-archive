# Diagramming knowledge production on PublicLab.org

On a recent (weekly) open research call, @liz and I wanted to work through some mental models of how knowledge is produced on Public Lab -- especially with our new #research-culture initiative. We're trying to make things clear and inviting, but we know there are lots of questions -- so we gave it a shot. @gretchengehrke and @stevie chipped in too!

For better or worse, our first attempt ended up being really complicated! Of course, everyone understands things differently, but although this was really interesting (see how **Ask a Question** spans from **Entry** to **Production**, challenging [the 1-9-90 ratio][1] -- the idea that only more involved people become content producers...), it wasn't helpful from the perspective of one person's journey through the site.

Well... helpful but COMPLICATED.

### Attempt 2

So we gave it another try -- shown here and as the main image. ![image description][3]

This one made a lot more sense to us! It starts with the basic interests/attitudes that a few different people might have upon arriving on the site, and imagines how they might transition to becoming more involved.

It's still a work in progress, and people of course understand things in different ways.

So, what do you think?

### Make your own diagram

We used Google Slides to do this -- and here's the document itself -- give it a go, and post your own diagrams in the comments!
