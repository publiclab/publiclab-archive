When flying smaller balloons like in the #mini-balloon-kit, a common issue is that due to the lower lift of these (say, one to three 36 inch mylar balloons) they are more sensitive to light winds blowing them down.

What happens is that the whole setup flies at a lower angle, rather than straight up.

Are there ways to add fins, tape or glue the balloons into some pattern, or otherwise stabilize the balloons so that they aren't as sensitive to wind? Perhaps to even generate lift, like a [kite-balloon-hybrid](/wiki/kite-balloon-hybrid) (there's a LOT on that page!)?

  
Any ideas welcome!
