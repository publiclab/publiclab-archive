<div>Egads! I was quoted as saying &quot;does it always have to be open source? No...&quot; -- but don&#39;t worry, I had a good reason to say so:</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/digital-mappers-plot-future-maptivism-0">http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/digital-mappers-plot-future-maptivism-0</a> (by Nancy Scola)</div>

We haven&#39;t made it compatible with any other system. We haven&#39;t translated it into anything beyond being just a picture.&quot;</span></div>
