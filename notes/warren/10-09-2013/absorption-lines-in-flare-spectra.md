###What I want to do

There seem to be some distinct lines missing in the [Chalmette flare spectra](https://spectralworkbench.org/tag/flare) folks have been collecting. There's a [separate post on emission spectra](/notes/warren/10-09-2013/trying-to-detect-emission-lines-in-flare-spectra-from-chalmette) in these, which is the primary goal; this is more of a speculative exploration on if we can also measure absorption lines since the flame is a good full-spectrum light source and the steamy/smoky stuff coming out might allow us to detect some molecules. Emission spectra are mostly just for atoms, not full molecules, so this would be a nice secondary technique.

Here's a great example of [an atmospheric spectrum](https://spectralworkbench.org/tag/sky) (of the sky):

###My attempt and results

Since we're not sure Scott's spectrometer is well calibrated, I tried to align the spectra visually using the green band as a reference. I compared it to [another spectrum from a Desktop kit](https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/10065), so the scale should be similar.

_Top, a [Chalmette flare spectrum from July 27](https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/10010). Bottom, a [sky spectrum from Moscow](https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/10065), showing a nice oxygen absorption line at ~760nm_

It seems to me that the faint line in the flare spectrum aligns with the ~760nm O2 line in the sky spectrum. Since that's a particularly strong absorption line (see this [annotated one by Liz](https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/913)), that seems feasible. 

###Questions and next steps

If we can identify some other absorption lines, and clean up the data a bit, we might be able to fingerprint other whole molecules. 

We should also try to figure out what the big missing region (big dip) in the red part of the spectrum is -- I don't think any absorption lines are that wide, so what's going on there (below)?
