I've just attached a **60 gram camera** (one of these [GoPro alternatives](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/05-20-2017/cheap-lightweight-gopro-alternatives-for-aerial-mapping)) to a single 36" mylar balloon, and it lifted -- not strongly, so it wouldn't hold up in much wind, but not bad either for a calm day.

This question gets a bit complicated, right? Like, how windy is it? How much does the string weigh?

How have you approached answering this question?
