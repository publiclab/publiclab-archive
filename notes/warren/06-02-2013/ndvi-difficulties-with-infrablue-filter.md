Some folks at [the pirateship](http://p.irateship.com) and I used a Roscoe 2008 filter which had not been very well white balanced to take some aerial photos of our building and neighborhood, but I found that the resulting NDVI images (made with Ned Horning's [Photo Monitoring plugin](/wiki/photo-monitoring-plugin)) didn't work very well -- the trees and lawn did not display with high NDVI values. What's the problem? Can I do a better post-white-balancing to recover useful data? 

Was the Roscoe 2008 not as good as the 2007? I notice that Chris F did not have one in his exhaustive comparative search for filters, in [this research note](/notes/cfastie/05-14-2013/artichoke-filter-search). But the filter looks visibly similar... what do you think? I can do a spectrometer scan of both for comparison.
