I found my way into this page for 2014: [https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/2014-national-emissions-inventory-nei-data](https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/2014-national-emissions-inventory-nei-data)

Which has a lot of point source and other data in Excel .xlsx.xlsx files, which I imagine we might add to the growing list of layers in [Leaflet Environmental Layers](/lel), but I'd like to know more about how good or incomplete the data is, and also if it's already reflected in Frac Tracker data:

[https://www.fractracker.org/map/national/us-oil-gas/](https://www.fractracker.org/map/national/us-oil-gas/)

Do folks know about the NEI and if it's useful data?

For what it's worth, it lists many sources and types, including:

Agriculture
Dust
Fires
Fuel Combustion
Industrial Processes
Miscellaneous
Mobile
Solvent
Industrial Surface Coating
Other Sector
