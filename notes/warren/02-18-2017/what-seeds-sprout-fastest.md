I'm working on the [Timelapse Kit](/wiki/timelapse), and want to create an activity to "test run" a camera indoors over a shorter span of time before doing in the field monitoring (see #timelapse for some folks doing this).

The reason is that doing a 24 hour or less test will reveal any issues much faster than putting it outdoors and waiting a week or more. 

So I'd like to propose that folks sprout some seeds and take a timelapse of that -- since it's kind of interesting, it's not fast enough to be visible to the naked eye, and seeds are easy and cheap to get a hold of. It's a good dress rehearsal, so to speak.

**But what kinds of seeds sprout fastest?**

I've started with chia seeds but they took 3 days to sprout at all... surely warmth would help, but that's still pretty slow.
