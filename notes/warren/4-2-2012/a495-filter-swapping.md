For the [near infrared camera](/tool/near-infrared-camera) mod with a Canon A495 camera, I wanted to record the size of the infrared-block filter that ships in the camera, so we can accurately cut replacement IR-pass filters. 

The measurements are:

##5/16 in x 3/8 in##

Guido Stein was talking about mass-producing these with a paper cutter or something. Good idea, i'm tired of cutting them by hand...

Luckily there's some margin for error; the outer millimeter or so is covered by the rubber gasket anyways (see above).
