A common classroom activity I remember is to scan different excited gases (safely inside glass tubes, the way a neon light works) using a spectrometer. Public Lab's \[foldable spectrometry kit\](/wiki/foldable-spec) makes this even more interactive -- you can make your own paper spectrometer with a DVD as a diffraction grating, and every student can make their own scans.

---------

## 1\. Construct a spectrometer

First, follow these instructions to make a spectrometer: [https://publiclab.org/notes/abdul/10-19-2016/foldable-paper-spectrometer-instructions](https://publiclab.org/notes/abdul/10-19-2016/foldable-paper-spectrometer-instructions)

---------

## 2\. Calibrate it

(optional but really helpful!) Follow these steps to calibrate on [https://spectralworkbench.org](https://spectralworkbench.org) :

[https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-01-2016/calibrating-your-spectrometer-in-spectral-workbench](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-01-2016/calibrating-your-spectrometer-in-spectral-workbench)

## 3\. Point it at a gas light source in a dark room

Use the button below to post your results, with a photo and a link to your spectrum at [SpectralWorkbench.org](http://SpectralWorkbench.org)!

What kind of gas are you scanning? What are the spectral excitation lines you're looking for?
