Greetings, DocCom members, and other [Barnraising](/barnraising) attendees!

What is **DocCom**, you ask? Well:

> Help to document and record content, sessions, ideas, and media from the Barnraising. Help produce our little one-page daily newspaper, **The Barnraiser.**  

(Secret: DocCom is the best Com!)

### The Barnraiser

[https://publiclab.org/wiki/the-barnraiser](https://publiclab.org/wiki/the-barnraiser)

As we have the past few Barnraisings, we're going to work from a **poster-sized paper-based layout over the course of the day**, so it's more collaborative, and stories come in on Post-Its. We'll then do a final version of the text, take a picture, insert the final photography, and print it!

At the start of the day, we'll put a call out for questions and article ideas, and over the course of the day, people can add post-its with article topics to the poster, which we'll put in a public area.

We'll have a brief "Barnraiser" meeting at the start of the event (I'll make an announcement). Stay sharp -- [two years ago, we won a "Pullet-zer" prize](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/11-23-2015/issues-1-3-of-the-barnraiser)!

### Session note-taking

As to broader documentation, we often have /too much content/ per session to effectively communicate out. I'm going to be suggesting we ask session members to try to do a **VERY concise wrap-up at the end of each session**, which could form the core of the session notes.

I'm also encouraging people to try to articulate what **questions** were raised during the session, to add to the Questions board (more on this soon); this is with the goal of placing good questions at the heart of our collaborative work.

### Photography

Bring a camera or get ready to wield your smartphone camera! We'll coordinate with DotCom (the social media Com!) to collect images via social media to be published in the Barnraiser. And feel free to upload good images in this post as well!

### Video

I'm also interested in potentially doing a series of very short (30s) video interviews with different Barnraising attendees over the course of the event. If folks are interested in this, speak up!

Do folks have questions, ideas, etc? We can and will have a chance to talk more as the event begins!

Thanks, I'm looking forward to working with you all!
