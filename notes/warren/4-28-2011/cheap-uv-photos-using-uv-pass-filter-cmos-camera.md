We're using a Hoya UV-pass filter which we bought from UQG Optics, but you can buy it [on Edmund Optics as well](http://www.edmundoptics.com/onlinecatalog/displayproduct.cfm?productid=1924) for $26.50. Here are some of its specs:

U-340 12mm Diameter Bandpass Filter
Stock #: NT46-096
Thickness (mm)	2.50
Center Wavelength CWL (nm)	340.00
Full Width-Half Max FWHM (nm)	85.00
Density (g/cm3)	2.92
Diameter (mm)	12.0
Dimensional Tolerance (mm)	±0.25
Thickness Tolerance (mm)	±0.2
Surface Quality	80-50

Its spectral profile is shown in this graph:

Though our CMOS camera could probably sense pretty low here, it's limited by the glass lens, which blocks a lot of UV light. We're not sure where the cutoff is.

The camera we used is the Canon SD4000 IS, which is a rear-illuminated CMOS camera. We removed the hot mirror filter, and added the Hoya UV-pass filter to the front. Rear-illuminated CMOS sensors are *very* sensitive in the UV range, as shown in this spectral sensitivity curve:

More soon from [Alex McCarthy](/people/alex-mccarthy), as to the uses of this camera in identifying petroleum contamination with [UV-fluorescence spectroscopy](/tool/spectrometer).

Here's a photo showing the image half-blocked with a simple UV filter which I believe is just a sheet of thick glass:
