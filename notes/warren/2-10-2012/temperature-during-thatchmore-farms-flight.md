Here it is in a Javascript Flot graph:

Extracted from exif data (attached with sample image) as a result of [this conversation](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/grassrootsmapping/S7Zj4VaiFEE) ([Earlier thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/grassrootsmapping/q-Lhd9E9tWA))

I used the following command to extract the data, did some find/replace, and made a Flot graph (view source on the graph above)

<code>exiftool -csv -CreateDate -CameraTemperature north-visible/IMG_* > exiftool-export-2.txt</code>
