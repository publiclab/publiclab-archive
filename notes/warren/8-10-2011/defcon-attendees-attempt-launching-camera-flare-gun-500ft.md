Reporting is thin as usual but some participants of the Defcon conference apparently tried using a flare gun with a video camera in the cartridge to take live video from 500+ feet. This sounds a little like when Rich Gibson, Stewart Long and I tried launching a camera with a parachute from a giant slingshot at WhereCamp 2011...<div>
