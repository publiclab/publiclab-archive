Today I spent a few hours hacking $10 Walgreens digital cameras with some young environmental scientists at [Parts and Crafts](http://partsandcrafts.org), a DIY-oriented "camp" in Somerville, Massachusetts. 

Three or four campers opened up the cameras with screwdrivers, and I assisted them in removing the infrared-block filter, as described in our [near-infrared camera page](/tool/near-infrared-camera).

We then added infrared-pass filters, made from negatives of exposed film, and set out to test our creations. Tomorrow we'll be creating giant photography "towers" from 8 foot tubes, taped together, and will attempt to do a very low altitude mapping of a nearby community garden.
