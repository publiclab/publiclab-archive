After an extended design process and a very long time actually getting these produced, we finally have a new balloon mapping kit box -- one which uses every available surface to try to get people to think about our Public Lab-y values of collaboration, lay expertise, DIY ethos, etc etc. while still looking nice and being useful. We worked with [Nickolas Peter Chelyapov](http://nickolaspeter.com/) and the results are fantastic. I just want to walk around with it all day!

Take a close look -- we're super happy with them. These are [already shipping](http://store.publiclab.org/products/balloon-mapping-kit).
