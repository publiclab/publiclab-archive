# Smartphone spectrometer molded samples have arrived!

We are now making final plastics decisions and setting up the final run of 1000! Just wanted to share these images as the samples arrived moments ago and they look great.

There are polypropylene samples (PP) and ABS samples. The ABS ones are a bit better shaped, less warped. But ABS is less recyclable. Mathew and I will discuss momentarily.

###Polypropylene parts

##Update

Screws arrived from Portland, here's what the ABS part looks like screwed together. Rad!

##Update 2

"Swirling" issues seems to be delaying the production :-( we'll keep you up to date but should be resolved quickly:
