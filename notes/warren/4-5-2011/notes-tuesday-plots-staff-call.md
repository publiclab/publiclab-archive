Stewart Long, Shannon Dosemagen and I caught up given that we're all working on PLOTS full time now; we're going to have bi-weekly meetings. 

We discussed various topics, but I mentioned that my goals this week include:

* front page changes - adding a slideshow or accordion thing to shuffle through our active projects after showing the first "panel"
* chrome on mac knitter failed -- couldn't get it to load base data. 
  * giving it a first location - doesn't seem to accept lat/lon
* data.plots.org
  * mockups
  * Stewart taking lead on data preparation: http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/maps
  * Jeff taking lead on the page, functionality, design
* KNC work
* poster draft
  *  color tests for readability
  * NAIP imagery backing up all our printed maps -- full bleed -- with 50% opacity
  * choose first 3 -- bay wilkinson, chandeleur balloon, stewart's choice
  * local descriptions from Shannon
* budget discussion - proportions -- our plots team thread

##Future work##

* logbook
* FOSS4G - April 15 abstract deadline
* video tutorials - contacting kristian hansen? and finding video funding...
* could membership contributions be redefined -- with more concrete returns? related to open source?

Next meeting at 10AM Eastern Friday, April 8th -- email team@publiclaboratory.org to participate!
