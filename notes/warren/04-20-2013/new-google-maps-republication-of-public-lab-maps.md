Chris Fastie mentioned on the Organizers call yesterday that he saw new maps of ours in Google Maps, and indeed I see one in the base layer at Dorn Cox's farm:

http://publiclab.org/map/cover-crop-trials-low-altitude-map-lee-new-hampshire/2012-05-23

See it on Google Maps here: http://goo.gl/maps/Fjxa8

That map was posted in our Archive on Jan 10th, so the import must've happened since then. FarmHack, GreenLink and Public Lab mappers made that map in the early fall of 2012.

Great work folks! You can also zoom in an amazing amount; see:
