Sourcing [from this page](/wiki/spectrometry-sampling), I'm interested in how to choose the best containers for samples while scanning. 

I've heard @eustatic distinguish between long-term storage, which could be in a cool, dark place, in glass, for most substances -- and short-term containers, which must:

* be optically extremely clear
* not be soluable in the solvent used (not a big problem for mineral oil, but isopropyl or diesel can dissolve different plastics)
  * so it doesn't melt the container
  * so the sample doesn't get contaminated by the melted material from the container
* not leak while you're using it
* be cheap -- <$1 each, hopefully!
* be small -- so light can shine through it, and not too much sample is required
* anything else?

There are actually resources across this site to answer this question; I'm just trying to get it all into one place!
