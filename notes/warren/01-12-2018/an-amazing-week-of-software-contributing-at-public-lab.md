Hi, everybody - i'm just opening an issue to say THANK YOU to everyone who's been coding here recently. ([cross-post from GitHub](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1981))

This is one of the most remarkable weeks we've ever had in this project. I had a pretty busy week and was not able to help with every detail over the past few days, but many recent newcomers to the project have really stepped up into leadership roles -- going well beyond just solving problems, to identifying new issues, cleaning up code, tackling bigger and much more complex projects, and even creating new issues to welcome newcomers into the project. What an amazing group!

Just a few highlights this week:

What a week! This is bigger than many months of work, and it's just the beginning.
