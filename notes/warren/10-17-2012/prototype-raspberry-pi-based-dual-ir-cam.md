Working on this prototype for the upcoming Barnraising -- i want to have a point-and-shoot IR-VIS camera which is light and can be sent up on a balloon, and which auto-composites image pairs. More progress soon, I'm starting to collect code here: 

https://github.com/jywarren/irkit/

https://github.com/jywarren/irkit/issues/1

Parts so far:

* 2x USB Webcam (SYBA, same as in the DIY Spectrometry Kit), one modified for near-infrared
* 1 Raspberry Pi
* 2 USB > Mini-USB cables
* 1 SD card
* 1 cardboard box
* 1 USB power supply, i'm ordering one that runs on AA batteries, and using a Micro-USB power supply for now.

The camera's internals can be seen below:

The idea is that for relatively low cost ($60) we could make a "hacker's camera" with both infrared and regular webcams built around a raspberry pi, which when you take a picture, auto-composites the two images into NDVI and NRG. So you're left with an SD card with precomposited images, as if it were a regular digital camera.

Later, we could add all sorts of other functionality -- 

* auto-timelapse/intervalometer -- 10 second auto-triggering
* put it in a waterproof box for a DIY GoPro
* add a mini USB wifi dongle and watch the video feed live from your phone/laptop
* add corner eyebolts for an easy Picavet suspension
* make an easy scripting system -- put any python script in the /scripts/ folder

I really like the idea that the first version is built into a small cardboard box, so I used a small Sparkfun box. 

Anyhow, I'm kind of stuck at the step of taking a single snapshot from the commandline on the Raspberry Pi (debian image). See here, I could def. use some help: https://github.com/jywarren/irkit/issues/1

**Update:** First images taken! Woohoo!
