# What are your thoughts on this initial sketch for a Tag page on PublicLab.org?

We're working a bit on redesigns of some of our main pages. I want to [collect some ideas and pool our thoughts](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-22-2018/how-do-we-do-user-interface-design-work-in-a-community-process) on goals for one page, the Tag Page -- which is here:

[https://publiclab.org/tag/particle-imaging](https://publiclab.org/tag/particle-imaging)

We've had some discussion on tag pages, [in this question](https://publiclab.org/notes/tommystyles/10-20-2017/need-your-feedback-on-tag-pages) -- and it was a great one -- but it went in a lot of different directions outside of the narrower question of the design of the tag page (into tag visualizations, nomenclature, other good stuff) but I worked a bit on the visual layout and information organization on the tag page itself, and have a rough sketch that I'd like to use as a starting point to refine the page design -- addressing other discussion topics in parallel.

### Goals

- less busy/overwhelming - cleaner, easier to follow information design
- quick at-a-glance view of the community engaged on this topic
- prominent ask a question prompt
- less confusion about Subscribe/Follow/Answer questions

### Inspirations

- GitHub Pulse: [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pulse/weekly](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pulse/weekly)
- I also wanted to point out @julvie's heuristic review, posted in this comment: [https://publiclab.org/questions/tommystyles/10-20-2017/need-your-feedback-on-tag-pages#a725](https://publiclab.org/questions/tommystyles/10-20-2017/need-your-feedback-on-tag-pages#a725)

Note that the code for the tag page can be found here:

  
https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/master/app/views/tag/show.html.erb  

  
You can read it in full here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1796lMEwSjUawamKIYebbsSikFBBboVK5lZ6jZFKJLXI/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1796lMEwSjUawamKIYebbsSikFBBboVK5lZ6jZFKJLXI/edit)

We'll be going through this and @cfastie's great [comments and input in this process](https://publiclab.org/questions/tommystyles/10-20-2017/need-your-feedback-on-tag-pages#answer-0-comment-17552), though we may go pretty slow and incrementally. Thanks, all!

You can edit the design yourself in this Google Presentation: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TCZoTfuhamRVrUak8aDgqJAwSgyhRtZg2Pgacl2\_4zc/edit#slide=id.g3924eb58a4\_0\_0](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TCZoTfuhamRVrUak8aDgqJAwSgyhRtZg2Pgacl2_4zc/edit#slide=id.g3924eb58a4_0_0)

After just doing some basic design cleanup, I guess I'd like to see people featured more prominently, maybe kind of like [on Community Toolbox at the page bottom](https://publiclab.github.io/community-toolbox/#r=all). Maybe using [Froala Design Blocks](https://publiclab.org/wiki/ui#Workflow) as we did [on the welcome page design](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/02-21-2018/what-do-you-think-about-this-new-design-sketch-for-a-welcome-page) could help with this, although it might push the rest of the content down even further.
