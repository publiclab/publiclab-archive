I've been curious about how little helium it'd take to lift a Möbius camera as we've been using for our [Infragram Point and Shoot cams](/wiki/infragram). 

We pay around $30 for the balloons in the balloon mapping kit, and helium can be $30-50 per flight, or worse in some places. So the ~$65 Möbius cam, which weighs about 38 grams, opens up some possibilities for us, compared to the 200-250g Canon Powershots we often use. 

18 inch Mylar balloons are less than a dollar apiece, and the above pictured 3 foot balloon is well under $10. I think we can get the 3 foot latex balloons for ~$3 each. The nice thing about Mylar is that it can remain inflated for a couple weeks, and either of these fits in a car or on the subway! So flights over multiple days are much easier, and instead of buying or moving a helium tank, you can fill these at a florist or party store. 

Anyhow the above test worked -- it lifts the Möbius easily! And I have ordered some 18 inch mylar balloons to test too.
