# Macro system for Spectral Workbench API

The [Spectral Workbench API](/wiki/spectral-workbench-api) is getting a boost with a new system for sharing macros, released late this week. Since it's an early-stage release, there are few links to it on the [SpectralWorkbench.org website](https://spectralworkbench.org), but you can published macros and share your own it by [visiting this page](https://spectralworkbench.org/macros/). 

Some notes on the system:

* currently it's only for Analyze page macros; the Capture page is being rewritten before we release the macro system there
* we'll be improving both the display of saved macros (with syntax highlighting) and the editor; if you have suggestions, leave a comment here!
* there will be a way to "install" or "favorite" macros for easy access, and a way to search for them
* macros may have comments
* the API continues to evolve but we'll hopefully be releasing some educational macros which will be both useful and educational

The macro system is where we plan to develop a lot of new features for the website; if you have JavaScript coding experience, this is a great way to get involved in shaping and improving Spectral Workbench!
