###   

Update! See [this post for our accepted proposals](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/04-23-2018/announcing-9-google-summer-of-code-projects-for-2018). Thanks everyone!

### RGSoC and GSoC

We're part of two different summer fellowship programs this year, [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org) (#RGSoC) and [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (#GSoC) -- both recruit software contributors to work on open source projects.

We've done GSoC for a few years now, and are really excited to be part of RGSoC for a second year. They write:

> All people with non-binary gender identities or who identify as women (transgender or cisgender) are welcome to apply.

[Learn more about the program](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students/application/) and get involved! They are also seeking coaches to help teams out over the course of the summer -- [learn more about coaching here](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/coaching/).

So, we're asking students **from both programs** to start posting their proposals for comment, here. Read on!

### Deadlines

RGSoC's application deadline is the 28th of February. GSoC's is March 27th.

### Read proposal ideas

Once you've gotten a bit familiar with our project (see **[our welcome page here](https://publiclab.github.io/community-toolbox/#r=all)**), the first step is to look over **our ideas page, [which you can find here](/wiki/gsoc-ideas#Ideas)**.

Please feel free to ask questions in the comments below, or to join our chat channel at [https://publiclab/chat](https://publiclab/chat)

Our welcoming page will help you understand how we collaborate, and we'll be there to help you take your first step. And [try tackling a first-timers-only issue](https://publiclab.github.io/community-toolbox/#r=all), to get an idea of how to become a contributor!

Please ask questions! We're very friendly and we love welcoming new people into our community.

### Post a proposal for comment

Once you've read through some of these ideas and become a bit more familiar with our projects, it's time to post a proposal of your own.

**You don't need to have a complete or even concrete idea** -- share your thoughts early and we'll help you refine your proposal, and help you choose something that's the right difficulty level as well as being something our project really needs.

We've created a template for you to post a proposal here. Click this button to begin:

[Start drafting a proposal](/post?n=899&title=SoC proposal:%20&tags=software,gsoc,gsoc-2018,rgsoc-2018,soc,soc-2018,soc-2018-proposals,response:13975)

**Note: RGSoC's official application is directly to the RGSoC organization**, through [their website](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students/application/). But we would like all RGSoC applicants to post a proposal here as well, because:

- we will review proposals here in looking over applications and indicating our preferences to to RGSoC folks leading up to Feb 28th
- we think it's great to have a dialogue with teams
- we'd like to know specifically about your planning process in tackling a project or set of projects
- we're friendly!
