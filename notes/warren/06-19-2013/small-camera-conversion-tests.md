I've been converting a series of sample cameras to identify good [Infragram Point & Shoot](http://kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/infragram-the-infrared-photography-project) candidates. These are all [suffering from blue channel IR leakage](/notes/warren/06-18-2013/continuing-difficulties-with-infrablue-in-cheaper-cmos-cameras) to varying degrees, but I wanted to share the teardown photos; they've all been easy to modify (much easier than Canons!):
