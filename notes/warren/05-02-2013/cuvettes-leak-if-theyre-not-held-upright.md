I ordered 100 plastic cuvettes for holding spectrometry samples, but unfortunately they leak pretty badly! The samples were different oils, so I wonder if water based samples would leak as badly... but in any case this isn't great for mobile DIY spectometry! 

Many folks won't be bothered if they don't move samples around much, but what alternatives do we have if we're on the move?
