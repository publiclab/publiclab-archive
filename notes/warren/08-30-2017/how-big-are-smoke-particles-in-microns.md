On the NASA AREN project call this week, there was a question from Kelly in Montana, about whether it's possible to look at smoke particles with a microscope. With the work we're compiling on #microscopes and #particulates ( #pm ) pollution, I wanted to ask if folks know how big smoke particles are. We're hoping to have DIY microscopes (with cameras attached) to image particles below 10 microns in size, and even down to 1 micron resolution if that's possible.
