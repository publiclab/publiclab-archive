# Could the BabyLegs DIY trawl be used to collect microplastics in my sink?

Odd question, i know, but after reading [this great guide on analyzing plastics forensically](https://publiclab.org/notes/maxliboiron/07-19-2018/how-to-analyze-plastics-forensically), I was thinking about the kinds of products we use in our homes, and if it would be possible to collect a sample before they go down the drain somehow, perhaps for comparison, and perhaps also just to see what we are potentially washing down in our own homes. 

  
Example - could we spit sparkly toothpaste into a small version of the trawl and rinse through it to isolate plastic beads?
