25-30 people showed up in Manomet Massachusetts this weekend and we had a great time kite mapping the [Tidmarsh Farms](/wiki/tidmarsh-farms-meetup) property together despite the cold weather. Here are a few photos and links:

* MapMill.org sorting of 2nd flight: http://mapmill.org/sort/2012-11-17-mass-tidmarsh-farms-vis-2
* Raw data from the aerial flights: http://archive.publiclaboratory.org/massachusetts/2012-11-17-massachusetts-tidmarsh-farms/
* Photos from Catherine: https://www.flickr.com/photos/50628274@N00/sets/72157632036855557/

(Send me more if you'd like me to post them, or [add them to the wiki page](/wiki/tidmarsh-farms-meetup))

Thanks to everyone for making this a great event -- we have high hopes for an active Boston Public Lab group in coming weeks/months! I wanted to especially thank Jen Hudon for making this event happen, and Glorianna Davenport for bringing us all to Tidmarsh!

I'll be posting an update soon with a MapKnitter.org link and we'll hopefully be organizing a MapKnitter meetup in a coffee shop some evening soon as well...
