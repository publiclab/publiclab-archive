[Mathew](/people/mathew) suggested that we try to automate the creation of Grassroots Mapping Forum issues by sourcing them from the website -- so I looked into converters that can make nicely formatted PDFs from RSS feeds. Attached are a few i generated, and there are options:

* http://fivefilters.org/pdf-newspaper/
* http://www.feedjournal.com/

They'd all need some tweaking (and maybe a pro account, if it's worth it) or we could try to monkey around with wkhtml2pdf (sp?) which is what offers the PDF download all over our website -- it can be styled with CSS.
