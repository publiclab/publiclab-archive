We've looked at copper pipes and plates as potential materials for our prototype copper plate discoloration test for hydrogen sulfide.

What are some other options? We're looking for:

- low cost
- easy to cut would be nice
- small, say 3x3 inches or less?
- can be scrubbed with acetone or solvent to clean off
- high purity copper? 

What have folks tried, or wanted to try out? We're hoping to make a [prototyping kit](/wiki/prototyping-kits) for this!

Also see this related question about setup:

And this one about how to scrub them clean before testing:
