# Embed a Q&A system on another website

Our Q&A system is based at [https://publiclab.org/questions](https://publiclab.org/questions) -- but most of our questions are actually sorted by topic, on pages like:  

- [https://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram#Questions](https://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram#Questions)
- [https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-copper-pipe#Questions](https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-copper-pipe#Questions)
- [https://publiclab.org/wiki/mini-balloon-kit#Questions](https://publiclab.org/wiki/mini-balloon-kit#Questions)

These each have a prompt to ask questions about this topic, like this:

\[questions:wind\]

These can also be **embedded on other websites** off of [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org), as in this example:

**See this example at [https://store.publiclab.org/products/mini-balloon-mapping-kit](https://store.publiclab.org/products/mini-balloon-mapping-kit)**

The code for embedding is a bit subtle, to the lower right of the questions tables -- you can click the 

The generated code will look something like:![image description](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/022/833/large/Screen_Shot_2017-12-06_at_4.54.07_PM.png "Screen_Shot_2017-12-06_at_4.54.07_PM.png")

Paste the one your questions grid generates onto a site that allows **iframes** and it'll show up there!
