The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (Public Lab) is a community--supported by a 501(c)(3) non-profit--which develops and applies open-source tools to environmental exploration and investigation. By democratizing inexpensive and accessible Do-It-Yourself techniques, Public Lab creates a collaborative network of practitioners who actively re-imagine the human relationship with the environment.

**Position Summary**

We are looking for a code fellow to work in our Providence office for a term of 6-8 weeks (depending on hours) at approximately 20 hours per week to assist in the upgrading and expansion of the MapKnitter website, which assists communities in creating maps of environmental issues using aerial photos. The fellowship position will be part of a team of 6+ developers from around the world.

[MapKnitter.org](http://MapKnitter.org) is a Ruby on Rails website with:

- A Bootstrap interface
- The Leaflet JavaScript mapping library
- Open source code available at [https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter](https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter)

Public Lab's open code community ([https://code.publiclab.org](https://code.publiclab.org)) is a diverse, global group of contributors who are committed to respect and mutual support, and to code and community practices which support newcomers. Our goal is to develop and maintain software that supports environmental monitoring and online collaboration in the broader Public Lab community. Our Code of Conduct can be found at [https://publiclab.org/conduct](https://publiclab.org/conduct).

**Responsibilities will include:**

- Setup of a local development copy of the MapKnitter software
- Installing and testing gem upgrades from [https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/labels/dependencies](https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/labels/dependencies)
- Helping to coordinate upgrades with project team members; cooperatively reading and reviewing code
- Identifying and listing UI issues related to MapKnitter upgrades as the project develops
- Assisting in Rails version upgrades
- Designing and building tests for MapKnitter's automated test suite

For context, see our overall project plan: [https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/300](https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/300)

Candidates should have experience with the following, although we can provide some support and training:

- HTML/CSS and JavaScript
- familiarity with Ruby on Rails
- git/Github workflow

We also ask that candidates have:

- The ability to balance multiple competing tasks and requests, and enjoyment from efficiently working toward goals and deadlines
- A desire for and fulfillment from working on a team, but also an ability to work independently on job tasks
- Incredible interpersonal skills, demonstrating great communication, kindness, respect, and patience within our collaborative work environment
- An enjoyment of problem solving and the ability to put this to use in areas where project operations could be improved
- Willingness to work remotely with some colleagues
