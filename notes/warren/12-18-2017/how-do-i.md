I've seen some good work on the site with #reagents, which change color or opacity of a liquid sample when a specific compound or chemical is present. Since lots of people are interested in using spectrometers to do this; what kind of experiment design would enable people to do reagent-based analysis with a DIY spectrometer like one of these?
