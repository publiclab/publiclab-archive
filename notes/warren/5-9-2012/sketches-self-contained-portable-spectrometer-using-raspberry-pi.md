Trying to think of how to get a portable spectrometer working. A [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) (once they start shipping more regularly) will be $25-35, so we could conceivably put one in the VHS case and have it record a spectra every X seconds. 

Thinking of how to view it live, I was wondering about plugging it over 1/8" audio into an Android device and using the phone screen to display the readings. But for now I'm mostly thinking about a device you could leave outside for a while.
