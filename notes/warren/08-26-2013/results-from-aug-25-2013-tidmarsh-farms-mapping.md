# Results from Aug 25, 2013 Tidmarsh Farms mapping

Glorianna Davenport and Gershon Dublon [hosted a mapping meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/event/7883512799) at [Tidmarsh Farms](http://tidmarshfarms.com/), as part of an [ongoing of the area](/tag/tidmarsh) this past Saturday. We did a huge amount of balloon mapping and I wanted to share the results. There are thousands of images, 12GB worth, so I'm going to [use the guidelines here](/wiki/sharing-images) to share them via BitTorrent. Here is the link:

> [magnet:?xt=urn:btih:b22a08e72efc5c353cbe2770e92bfa54b3e38fb2&dn=tidmarsh-26-08-2013](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:b22a08e72efc5c353cbe2770e92bfa54b3e38fb2&dn=tidmarsh-26-08-2013)

[Learn how to download the images here](/wiki/sharing-images) and contact me (via comments) if it doesn't work; I'll keep mine online for a few weeks but after that they'll be harder to get a hold of. 

###Sorting

I've put the images up on MapMill now, and you can sort them here:

###Processing

We're still figuring out how to post-process these images into NDVI-like data on plant productivity, but most of the work is going on at the [infrared discussion list](/wiki/mailing-lists), so join in there. Here are some nice previews and attempts to process NDVI using [Infragram Sandbox](http://infragram.org/static/sandbox/):

###Infragramming

Standard NDVI didn't work so well on this set, so the above NDVI was a variant using `((R-B)/(R+B)-0.14)*-1440` in the Hue field of the HSV input on [Infragram Sandbox](http://infragram.org/static/sandbox/). Basically it just heightened the contrasts so you could see differentiation.

###Update

The Lippincotts, who stopped by to check out the mapping progress (and brought some much-needed supplies like grapes and granola bars -- thanks!) send in some photos as well:
