Hi, all - in the Activities (#activity-grids) session of the #barnraising, we briefly (among many other great topics) talked about the different kinds of activities people do (and we could/should provide guides to) across PL -- and one really relevant question that stuck out to me was:

> How many people does it take to do this activity?

or conversely,

> How many people can do this activity together?

I loved this question and would like to take a small next step by adding "**# of people**" as one thing listed on our activity grids, alongside such difficult-to-define columns as "difficulty" (a can of worms we need to open!)

What do folks think about this?
