###What I want to do

Building on work by @viechdokter and @stoft, and related to their and @yagiz's work on interior rigidity, I wanted to try a design that could be lasercut and fit around the existing spectrometer, and/or one whose internals have been upgraded for added rigidity. 

Check out their work:

* https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/03-02-2015/plab-3-spectrometer-upgrade-prototype
* https://publiclab.org/notes/ygzstc/08-19-2015/some-suggestions-for-spectrometer-v3-0-and-oil-testing-kit-otk-attachment

###My attempt and results

The above is 4 parts plus four bolts, and when all four are in place the bolts make it quite rigid. Acrylic will of course be more rigid than cardboard, but I'm doing the design work in cardboard for easy cutting/changing. Cardboard actually adds a lot of rigidity by itself though, and you could make it out of wood too if you like.

This one is 13.5 inches long and has space for an LED sample holding cuvette frame (see [recent work on cuvette frames here](/tag/cuvette-frame)) or some other thing you might add to the end. 

 

###Questions and next steps

I'd like to make a PDF or vector version of this and lasercut it and post the plans. 

I like @stoft's idea of trapping the USB cable so that's another improvement to add.

###Why I'm interested

I'd like to meet some of the specs @stoft and I [have been developing](https://publiclab.org/notes/viechdokter/04-15-2016/thinking-about-a-more-stable-spectrometer#c14300) for measurable rigidity, and while this only addresses exterior rigidity, it could be paired with some of the above refinements to provide overall rigidity. Also it's an exploration of whether we can get sufficient rigidity (which I hope we'll soon define more specifically) while building on the v3 Kit's design. 

### Update

I've made vector designs for these -- in various formats, with an attempt to make holes for cable threading, to relieve pressure on the cables.
