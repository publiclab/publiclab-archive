We've just redesigned the [foldable spectrometer](http://store.publiclab.org/products/foldable-mini-spectrometer) packaging to tell a clearer story about what the device is, how it's used, and it's development in a collaborative community. The new envelopes look great and we're excited to start shipping them today!

I also took some time to do some more product shots, take a look:
