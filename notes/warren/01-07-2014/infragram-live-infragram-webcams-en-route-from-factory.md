###Infragram Live

Following up on [my post from a couple weeks ago](/notes/warren/12-28-2013/live-webcam-infragramming-webgl-option), we've refined and improved the Infragram Live feature, enabling you to run real-time [NDVI processing](/wiki/ndvi) or [Infragrammar](/wiki/infragram-sandbox) expressions on video from an Infragram webcam. This is pretty exciting; check out the demo:

###Webcams in transit

The hundreds of new Infragram Webcams have just shipped to us from the factory where they were modified, and are expected to arrive around Jan 9th. We'll be testing, packaging, and shipping them shortly afterwards. Get ready!
