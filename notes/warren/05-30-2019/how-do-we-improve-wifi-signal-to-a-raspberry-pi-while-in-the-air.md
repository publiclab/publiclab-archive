The #pi-camera Raspberry Pi cameras people are starting to use can do live Wifi streaming video if you can get a signal, but I found that the signal didn't reach once it was really up in the air. 

  
But I wonder if a laptop would do better than a phone at connecting (bigger antenna?) Or if some parabolic chicken wire antenna could be built as a "downlink"... interesting, just like with a real satellite!
