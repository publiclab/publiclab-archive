###Overview

The past few months have been focused on intense coding, optimization, and feature refinement rather than major migrations or other disruptions -- in part due to Dogi's tireless maintenance of our servers (thanks @nemo!). This has resulted in stable growth and a variety of long-requested new features being implemented. 

###New site features
 
A variety of new features have been added, including: 
 
* **Event features:** RSVP and date selection features have been added to make organizing events easier without needing to use Eventbrite or other services (Github link](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/57))
* **Coauthorship:** users can now indicate co-authors, strengthening collaboration and attribution (Github link](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/113))
* **Callouts:** use of @warren or @liz in comments auto-links to those users’ profiles, and also alerts them via email (Github link](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/116))
* **Newsletter helper:** newsletters are now templated by the site, making the weekly task of assembling a newsletter (typically by Shannon Dosemagen) much faster. 
* **Profile pictures:** due to strong demand, users can now include a profile photo which will begin to be used throughout the site (Github link](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/71))

_Using the tag `with:username`, you can now give people co-authorship credit on a research note!_

_Callouts -- a great new feature which makes it easy to draw a few people into a conversation on a topic via email notifications._


###Uptime

Minimal changes have occurred on Public Lab's web serving infrastructure; uptime remains very high: PublicLab.org has uptime as follows:

* April: 99.93%
* May: 99.57%
* June: 99.92%

###Usage & mailing lists

We’ve seen some really strong mailing list growth as we enter the 3rd quarter of 2014 -- as of July 16, **we have 2,484 members on the main publiclaboratory group**. You can [view all the groups here](/lists). Other interesting statistics follow, including graphs of activity over the past 52 weeks:

**1980 research notes have been posted by 317 contributors since over 3 years ago**
