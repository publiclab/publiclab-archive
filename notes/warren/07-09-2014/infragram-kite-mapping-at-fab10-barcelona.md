I held two workshops at Fab 10 (http://fab10.org) where we launched an [Infragram](/wiki/infragram) Point & Shoot (a modified Mobius Action Cam) above the D-Hub and next to the Torre Agbar, which was pretty photogenic. 

###Camera setup

I'd gotten it running with a timer and custom white balance using the config file [Mathew](/profile/mathew) posted ([see instructions here](/wiki/infragram-point-shoot)) but I'm not sure the white balance was working for these flights, as there's a strong red tinge to the photos. Perhaps very bright sunlight needs a different white balance, or perhaps for some reason the white balance was just not registering? I used option #8 as Mathew suggested for this batch of cams, so maybe i need to try a few others, but it had been working all right on the ground that morning. 

###Lens distortion

Apparently (according to some folks from Asturias who joined me on one of the flights) you can purchase a different lens for the Mobius, but the fisheye is nice in that you get large areas. But it'd be nice to remove the distortion, perhaps as part of MapKnitter? [This article](http://popscan.blogspot.in/2012/04/fisheye-lens-equation-simple-fisheye.html) describes the fisheye lens equation and has some Java code... maybe we can port it to JavaScript.

###Images

In any case, here are [Infragrammar-processed](http://infragram.org) images, although i boosted the contrast and NDVI values in both:

And some of the amazing raw images we got. Notice especially the second-to-last showing a temporary structure built by Dani Iba√±ez and others, and the final photo showing the Sagrada Familia, albeit from a distance!
