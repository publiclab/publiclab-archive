I took these portraits in a session at the open water workshop at Propeller, in New Orleans, tonight. 

Each person was asked to select a random bit of electronics off a table, and to give it a name. Then they were asked to pretend it was a sensor which solved an environmental problem they had, and to name what it sensed. 

I loved the activity because everyone gave their sensors "human" names, and it sort of seemed like they were describing "imaginary friends" who could detect the kinds of pollutants or environmental metrics they wish they could see. Enjoy the photos, and thanks to everyone who participated!
