Hello all, happy 4th in advance, and here's our latest recap from PL's Web Working Group:

####Foldaways

Foldaways are a small but important change to wiki editing -- a feature where you can hide or "fold away" some in-depth content so that readers may choose to "dive deeper" if they like. You can read about how to use them [on the Authoring Help page](/wiki/authoring-help#Foldaways). They look like this on the page:

I've used them already, [on the Oil Testing Kit page](/wiki/oil-testing-kit)

##SSL

Kep Peterson, who joined as our sysadmin, has been setting up a wildcard SSL certificate, which will fully encrypt PublicLab.org for better security across our platforms. More on this soon.  

##Upcoming

Work this coming month will focus on [a new graphing and analysis system](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/milestones/Graphing%20design%20overhaul) for [Spectral Workbench](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/) (in support of the [Oil Testing Kit](/wiki/oil-testing-kit)), as well as some coding on the [WhereWeBreathe project](https://github.com/publiclab/wherewebreathe/) and the Spectral Workbench Macros system.


##PublicLab.org

A reasonable amount of small work was done on PublicLab.org - the [newly relaunched blog](/blog) and some refactoring, as well as enabling upload of KML and GPX were some highlights. Read more [on Github Pulse](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pulse/monthly).
