A [Parts & Crafts](http://partsandcrafts.org) over a year ago, we built a spectrometer/turntable which 'played' colors by inverse fast Fourier transforming them into sound... using code which was really not very well implemented. But it was interesting to see, and I think someday we could create "guitar pedals" which distort sound based on the spectral reading of a material. Fanciful indeed, but perhaps another interesting use for spectrometry!
