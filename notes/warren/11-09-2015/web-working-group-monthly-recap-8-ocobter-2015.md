Late again this month; apologies! Busy time of year. Let's jump right into it:


##MapMill 2.0

This is now online at: http://mapmill.org

Try it out -- it's early pre-release at the moment. We know of some queueing bugs related to large #s of simultaneous uploads. Hope to hammer them out soon now that it's online.

##SSL on PublicLab.org

This was launched over the past weekend; we had some issues with store.publiclab.org, but they are almost completely resolved at this point. Final changes should happen shortly. Thanks for your patience. Read more here:

* https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/58 - https/SSL secure connection
* https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/110 - insecure includes

This was a pain, but is long overdue. Thanks to @icarito for finally pushing it through. We'll make SSL mandatory shortly; some browsers already do this.


##PublicLab.org

We had 7 issues closed by 3 people on this codebase; besides the SSL stuff, mostly smaller things like some @callout testing and tweaking and some email notification fixes; [check it out on Github Pulse](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pulse/monthly).

* https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/58 - https/SSL secure connection 2 hours ago
* https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/109 - SSL site blocks older youtube embeds 2 hours ago

##Map Knitter

No changes here; just added a Features sidebar administered from PublicLab.org on the dashboard. 


##SpectralWorkbench.org

The doozy as usual over the past few months -- LOTS of changes. Highlights: a complete test suite of 70+ Jasmine tests of almost every aspect of the JavaScript features in the upcoming 2.0 release. Not full test coverage, but not really all that far from it. Details in the README.

Otherwise, 12 issues closed; [check it out on Github Pulse](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/pulse/monthly):

* https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/issues/196 - optimization of server-side queries - prob. most related to comparison & other SpectraPanes 3 days ago

##Grapherate

This project, for graphing live sensor feeds, is still emerging -- early prototype warning! But check it out:

https://github.com/jywarren/grapherate/

There are plenty of to-dos, and we have it working both with OpenPipeKit streams [on Phant](http://data.sparkfun.com) and with InfoAmazonia's sensors.


Thanks again to our contributors, both coders and non-coders -- and if you know any coders who might like to get involved, point the at http://publiclab.org/wiki/developers!
