(reposting a question [by Dani S from our Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/kickstarter-gold-balloon-mapping-kits/comments)) -- of course, it depends on a lot of things!

I'm thinking -- the considerations are:

- weight
- cost
- complexity (ease of building/fixing)
- portability (does it pack down for transport)
- stability in the wind
- crash-proofness
- waterproofing
- ...?

There are LOTS of solutions for this posted at [https://publiclab.org/wiki/photo-rig](https://publiclab.org/wiki/photo-rig) -- but in particular, what are very lightweight ways of doing this, since the [new Mini Balloon Kit](/wiki/mini-balloon-kit) is designed for cameras <100g, and a heavy enclosure could easily double that?

For starters, let's share some photos of different ways to do this!
