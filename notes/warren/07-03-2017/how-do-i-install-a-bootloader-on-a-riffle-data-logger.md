A freshly made [Riffle](/wiki/riffle) needs to have a bootloader installed like any Arduino-compatible microcontroller. Is burning a bootloader the [same as on a classic Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/Bootloader?from=Main.Bootloader)? Or an [Arduino Nano clone](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Burn-a-Bootloader-to-Clone-Arduino-Nano-30/)?

I know the Riffle uses one of those cheaper CH\_\_\_ USB chips. Just wondering if that changes anything.

Also - are any special cables required? It looks like there are six pins in a 2x3 grid in the image that seem like they could be for programming:
