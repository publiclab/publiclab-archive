Hi, all - thanks to those who attended the kickoff chat. We'll be meeting in the same place, same time next week ([see the schedule here](/wiki/oil-testing-kit-beta#Schedule)).

###OTK Blog

First, I wanted to mention that we have a program blog here: http://publiclab.org/blog/oil-testing-kit

You can post to it at: http://publiclab.org/wiki/oil-testing-kit-beta#Share+your+work

This is an easy way to share your work and any difficulties you've encountered. It'd also be great if you left comments on one anothers' posts -- if you see something that could be improved or adjusted, or just for encouragement!

###Chat recap

Some additional notes from the chat:

* We'll have a new calibration procedure posted and documented very soon - perhaps as early as Friday
* Safety: Please be careful with the laser, and the samples, they are motor and crude oils, and toxic. Ventilation!
* Please share your difficulties, with pictures. Comment on one another's posts!

###Mineral oil

There was a discussion about mineral oil -- it was not included in the kit, but is available in most pharmacies and supermarkets -- it is used as a laxative. Since it was chosen specifically because it does not fluoresce, we don't feel that different mineral oils should make a difference, but please do record a baseline of pure mineral oil in a cuvette and upload it as you begin your scanning. (Which is next week's topic!)

Mineral oil is also available online for $9 on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Vi-Jon-Inc-S0883-Mineral-Oil/dp/B001B2RG1C/

##Next meeting

The next chat is next week, Oct 7, same time and place, and the topic will be: **preparing samples, scanning and uploading**. The chat, is available at:
