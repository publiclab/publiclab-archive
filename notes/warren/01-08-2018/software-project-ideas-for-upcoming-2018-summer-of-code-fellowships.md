We're applying to the 2018 [Google Summer of Code program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) as we do each year, and after a great summer with the [Rails Girls Summer of Code program](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org), we'll be applying to that program as well.

**What projects are people interested in tackling this summer?**

Some of our biggest and best software projects have come our of summer fellowships like these, including:

- [Leaflet Blurred Location](https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location/), which underpins our geographic features
- [Image Sequencer](https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/), which will be the new core of [Infragram.org](https://infragram.org)
- [WebJack](https://github.com/publiclab/webjack/), for getting data logging data onto laptops and phones easily

And many more! Read about [how these projects went last summer](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-07-2017/wrapping-up-google-summer-of-code-2017-at-public-lab).

Read about last year's proposals here: [https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/02-28-2017/call-for-proposals](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/02-28-2017/call-for-proposals) -- there are a few that didn't get accepted (we have a limited number of slots) so we could resuscitate some.

**Update: we now have [an ideas page up here](/gsoc-ideas); read through the list!**
