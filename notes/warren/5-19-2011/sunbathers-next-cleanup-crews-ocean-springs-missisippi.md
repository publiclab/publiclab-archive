This is a great excerpt from the [Ocean Springs map](/map/ocean-springs-missisippi/2010-6-18), made by Erin Sharkey and a couple AmeriCorps volunteers in June 2010. Her notes on the trip are detailed and helpful. I think it may be one of our largest maps!

See how there are sunbathers on the right side of the image, and cleanup crews on the left side?
