This site looks pretty sketchy, but they link (and clearly reference) a NASA image from the ASTER satellite's thermal camera, of the "Joliet 29" coal power plant in Illinois.

> These ASTER false-color images were acquired over Joliet 29, a coal-burning power plant in Illinois. Joliet 29 can be seen in the VNIR image (top) as the bright blue-white pixels just above the large cooling pond. Like many power plants, Joliet 29 uses a cooling pond to discharge heated effluent water. In the bottom image a single ASTER Thermal Infrared band was color-coded to represent heat emitted from the surface. The progression from warmest to coolest is shown with the following colors: white, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and black.

It goes on to discuss thermal shock, environmental effects, causes of thermal pollution, and has a decent bibliography.
