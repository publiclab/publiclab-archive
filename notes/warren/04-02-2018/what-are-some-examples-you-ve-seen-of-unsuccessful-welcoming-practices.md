In the spirit of the examples listed at http://www.firsttimersonly.com/ (see lead image), I'm interested in what we can learn from examples of when welcoming newcomers has gone poorly. 

Please don't post things that are code of conduct violations -- let's assume for the purposes of my question that we're interested in practices that are not overtly disrespectful, but that nonetheless do not help newcomers feel they are valued and encouraged to become involved.
