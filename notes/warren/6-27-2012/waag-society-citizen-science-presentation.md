I'm giving a talk this morning at the Waag Society in Amsterdam. Here are my slides! I cite a number of projects from PLOTS and this afternoon we'll be doing some balloon mapping workshops.

**Update:** Also -- it's hard to tell from the slides without my comments, but the first several slides about "helping scientists do their science" was presented as a criticism, not a vision of how Public Lab should work. Slides 3-5 are an overview of the problems with citizen science as it's often defined.
