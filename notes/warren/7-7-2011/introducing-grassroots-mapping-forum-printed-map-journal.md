Hello mappers etc!

We've just launched the first issue of the "Grassroots Mapping Forum", our new community research journal/archive/zine/map, where we hope to share ideas, techniques, and stories from the Grassroots Mapping community. (For those of you who don't know, we are a community of activist cartographers who use DIY tools for civic science -- we take aerial photos using kites and balloons of things like the BP oil spill.)

The front of every issue, which is essentially a giant printed map, will depict a Grassroots Mapping site -- the first one is of an island in Wilkinson Bay, Louisiana, with oil residue along a wetlands coastline.  It is printed on a single 22.75x35" sheet, folded down to just over letter size, and includes a full color reproduction of a grassroots map along with essays, illustrated guides, and interviews on the reverse.

You can find out more, and purchase the first issue here for $17 shipped:

If you're interested in supporting <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org">Public Laboratory's</a> work, consider buying 3 or 4 and giving them to your friends.

The first issue of the Grassoots Mapping Forum was sponsored by <a href="http://developmentseed.com">DevelopmentSeed</a>, creators of <a href="http://mapbox.com">MapBox</a>, and we are looking for sponsors for future maps. If you're interested, please get in touch.
