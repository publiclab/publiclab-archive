[Mathew Lippincott](/profile/mathew) has been [collecting and posting research on low-cost approaches to silica detection](/notes/mathew/04-22-2014/frac-sand-mining); I saw this exhibit showing sheets of mica under a spinning polarizer, which was pretty cool. I thought perhaps there might be some way to spin a polarizer in front of a smartphone camera and measure the intensity signal over time, maybe in multiple color channels, to detect silica dust. Half-baked thought.
