This book came out a while ago, and is pretty widely distributed. They reworked our balloon mapping instructions, but the soda bottle rig is clearly recognizable. They didn't mention Public Lab on the page itself (oh well), but there is an acknowledgement at the end of the book, with a URL.

So... when's the Public Lab book coming out? :-P
