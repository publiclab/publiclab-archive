Hi, all - next week, we'll be hosting a meetup at Parts & Crafts for folks interested in Public Lab software, from 5:30-8pm, Wednesday Sept. 9, just before the Public Lab OpenHour hangout. 

Feel free to stay for [OpenHour](/openhour); the theme this month is "Transparency in Environmental Policy and Science"

(_above: some of the kids we hope to recruit to code :-P, credit: [Parts & Crafts](https://partsandcrafts.org/makerspace/open-shop/)_)

##Present

I'm hoping folks will bring any projects they're working on (Open Pipe Kit? FarmOS? Riffle?) and we'll have some time for people to present their projects at the beginning.

##Learn

I'll be showing people how to install the software (links below) that runs PublicLab.org, SpectralWorkbench.org, or MapKnitter.org -- using free accounts on c9.io, or Ubuntu/Debian if you have that already running on your laptop. 

We are hoping to interest folks who'd like to contribute to free/open source software which helps identify and understand pollution, as well as helps people collaborate on open hardware projects towards that goal. Questions? Ask away on the plots-dev list (cc'ed)!

There will be pizza & beverages, but feel free to bring what you like! And a laptop!

[Parts & Crafts](http://partsandcrafts.org) is at 577 Somerville Ave, walkable from the Porter Sq T stop in Somerville.
