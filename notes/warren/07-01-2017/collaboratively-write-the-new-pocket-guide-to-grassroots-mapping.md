As we gear up for the launch of our [new Mini Kite and Balloon Kits](http://kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/kickstarter-gold-balloon-mapping-kits/), we're looking to revisit, revise, and update one of our most classic collaborative works -- the [Guide to Grassroots Mapping with Balloons and Kites](/wiki/guides).**(Update: **the pocket guide is [now published](https://store.publiclab.org/collections/mapping-kits/products/pocket-guide-to-grassroots-mapping "https://store.publiclab.org/collections/mapping-kits/products/pocket-guide-to-grassroots-mapping"), see links below - and [this Spanish edition](https://publiclab.org/notes/imvec/02-08-2020/guia-de-mapeo-colectivo-con-globos-y-cometas-en-espanol)!)

  
From early on, this illustrated guide helped get the word out on paper, and long before we began distributing physical kits, we spread this PDF far and wide. It's been translated into over a dozen languages (including Arabic, Spanish, Ukranian, Portuguese, Korean, Russian, Turkish, Dutch, and German) adapted, updated, and occasionally Frankensteined into many different versions.

For this campaign, we wanted to take some time to collate and organize the best of these guides into a new, pocket-sized guide. **And we'd like to ask all balloon and kite mappers to help out, in a massively collaborative writing project!**

### Start contributing!

Here's an **editable Google Doc of the guide**. To keep things simpler for now, we're going to ask people to leave _short comments: ideas, corrections, and suggested text_ -- please break them up into 140 characters max, so we can try to respond to each separately!

To begin editing, [open the document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T2j5S-h0FeIuxmdYvx6C0aDbsPM-sArjvh9HQfqKUrA/edit).

And of course, leave comments below if you have questions in general! I'm sure there will be a LOT of things to figure out as we go.
