This has been taking a while since they are shipping us samples as they attempt the webcam conversions, but we finally confirmed that they can do the conversion and they sent us the above sample photograph (the webcam itself is in the mail). Looking good! 

Once we hash out the details of the order, we're going to give them the go-ahead to start production, and will post some updates as we know the final schedule. Fingers crossed!
