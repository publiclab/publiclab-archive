Folks [organizing on this page](/wiki/harvey) are looking to comb through aerial photography of Harvey damages. What are the best sources? 

That page (https://publiclab.org/wiki/harvey) is also a good source for imagery, especially the notes from the Open Calls that are posted there -- although it may take some digging through to compile them. Any help appreciated!
