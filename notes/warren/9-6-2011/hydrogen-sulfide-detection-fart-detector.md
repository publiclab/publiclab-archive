This amazing documentation of a fart detector uses a hydrogen sulfide sensor similar to what we're attempting to use in (natural) gas patch communities to detect harmful air contamination:

The two young gentlemen from Cornell (Robert Clain and Miguel Salas) who assembled the project helpfully cite toxicological effects of H2S:

They also provide source code for their detection system.
