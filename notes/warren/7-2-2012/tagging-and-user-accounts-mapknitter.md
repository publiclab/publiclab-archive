A couple of new features have hit MapKnitter recently -- one you may have noticed is that you can now [log in at MapKnitter](https://mapknitter.org/login) using your PublicLaboratory.org user account. This gives you "ownership" over the map, and we'll soon be letting you "lock" a map once it's done, or perhaps to moderate comments on a map or other features. Feel free to chime in on the mailing list with requests or bugs (or [directly on Github](https://github.com/jywarren/mapknitter/issues/new))

The other feature is tagging -- if you are logged in, you can now add tags to any MapKnitter map, and we've already started doing this to allow grouping/search of, say, ["pollution" maps](https://mapknitter.org/tag/pollution) or ["infrared" maps](https://mapknitter.org/tag/infrared). Hopefully this will help find maps on certain themes. Jump in and tag away, and report any bugs you find!
