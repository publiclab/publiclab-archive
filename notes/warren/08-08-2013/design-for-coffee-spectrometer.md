Based on the [ideas I was brainstorming a few days ago](/notes/warren/08-06-2013/brainstorming-coffee-analytics-system-for-coffee-shops), I put together a 3d model of a sort of countertop smartphone-based coffee spectrometer which uses eyedroppers as the sample container. It has a built-in light in a closed chamber, and shines light through the eyedropper full of coffee, and into the smartphone camera.

I'm going to try to have this 3d printed at Shapeways.com, and see if I can get it working.

Here's the Sketchup file I made: <a href="/system/images/photos/000/001/064/original/coffee-spec.skp"><i class="icon icon-file"></i> coffee-spec.skp</a>

**Here is another Sketchup file** which I tried to make "watertight" for 3d printing: <a href="/system/images/photos/000/001/066/original/coffee-spec-for-printing.skp"><i class="icon icon-file"></i> coffee-spec-for-printing.skp</a>

And a few more file types:

<a href="/system/images/photos/000/001/070/original/coffee_spec_for_printing_2.obj"><i class="icon icon-file"></i> coffee_spec_for_printing_2.obj</a>

<a href="/system/images/photos/000/001/071/original/coffee-spec-for-printing.dxf"><i class="icon icon-file"></i> coffee-spec-for-printing.dxf</a> (AutoCAD '12)

###Update

The 3d print came back! It looks super nice, although I'll probably polyurethane it to make it shinier and more spill-proof. It needs black paint on the inside, as well. I'll try to outfit it soon and see what we can get done with it:
