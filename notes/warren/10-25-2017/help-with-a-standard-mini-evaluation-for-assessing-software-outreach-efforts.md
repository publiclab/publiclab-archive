In our continuing #software-outreach efforts, and after this past summer's great Summer of Code programs -- #soc-2017 -- I want to do a small survey to see if we can measure the effectiveness of some of our outreach and onboarding efforts.

(note that I'm also starting to collect info about these strategies [on this page](/wiki/software-outreach))

Roughly, we've gone from **~16 contributors in May 2016 to over a hundred today**, a pretty dramatic change for about 18 months, especially after having only 16 contributors since our codebases were started in 2010\. We have been seeking to invite and support a more diverse coding community as well, to develop a better site (this site -- [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org)) with input from more perspectives.

But I know only enough about evaluation as a science or skillset to know that I don't know enough about it. I'm trying to:

1. write questions that are not leading
2. write check-all-that-apply and scale from 1-5 questions so we can quantify the results more easily
3. allow space for open response answers

I need help getting a small survey together that we can send our contributors, and I'd especially like it if other free and open source projects used it so we could have some standardization of evaluation across projects, and better understand how we relate to efforts in other communities.

---------

## Questions

In particular, I'm interested in:

- effectiveness of our efforts to support and encourage new contributors
- satisfaction and feedback on these efforts from newcomers
- better understanding of the diversity of our new contributors, and in change over time

## Sharing results

Also, **should this be anonymous** and **should we publish the results in full or in part** so we can compare with other orgs and learn as a community about our efforts?

Finally, I'd love it if other project seeking to do their own mini-eval projects could adopt a standard, ready-made survey, maybe add a question or two to the end, and not be stuck as I am on developing an eval from scratch.

---------

That said, I'm VERY happy to simply adopt a survey that's out there, and add on some of our more specific questions.

Thanks for any help!

### Survey draft

I've posted the questions [here in a Google Doc as well](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15zsXN0HWBsYIwrOnUPLq45T2d_V5uyzLG4zbfL8QzX0/edit?usp=sharing) -- please leave comments below here and offer edits on the doc!

## Introduction

We’re working hard to make our project more welcoming to newcomers, and to invite contributions from a more diverse community -- we see this as essential to improving the project and building on a wider range of perspectives and experiences. 

This survey is anonymous but if you’d like to leave your contact information for any follow up, 

## What we’ll do with the results

...

## Core questions

Was this the first open source project you contributed to?

How did you hear about this project? (check all that apply)

1. from a friend or acquaintance
2. on GitHub, GitLab, or another code sharing site
3. on Twitter, Facebook, or other social media
4. through an event
5. through a bootcamp, training, or class
6. on the project website

Why did you choose this project? (check all that apply)

1. friendly
2. easy
3. interested in the project goals
4. looking to build my own skills
5. ...

Do you plan to continue contributing to this project? 

What were your motivations for contributing to this project? (multiple choice)

How would you rate the effectiveness of this project's efforts at welcoming new contributors?

## First-timers-only issues

Did you do a first-timers-only (FTO) issue?

Did you make any FTO issues? how many?

Did you feel the FTO issues you did better prepared you to contribute to Public Lab code? (1-5)

## Creating your own first-timers-only issues

Did did you feel that creating your own FTO issues for others supported your ability to contribute?

Did you feel creating your own FTO issues for others supported your ability to contribute?

Did you feel creating or completing FTO issues made you a better software contributor in general?
