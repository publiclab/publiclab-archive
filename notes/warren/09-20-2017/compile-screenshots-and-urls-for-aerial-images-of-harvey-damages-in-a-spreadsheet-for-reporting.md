We're working to support the reporting of pollution incidents following Hurricane Harvey

## 1\. Search the map for industrial sites

We need to help the Gulf Restoration Network and other community based orgs make a list of image URLs for as many sites from this map as possible:

NOAA map post-storm: [https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/storms/harvey/index.html](https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/storms/harvey/index.html)

![screenshot 1](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/714/large/Screenshot_2017-09-20_at_10.37.43_AM.png)

If you're not sure where to start, look through these lists of industrial sites:

[https://publiclab.org/wiki/harvey-images#Industrial+sites+in+TX](https://publiclab.org/wiki/harvey-images#Industrial+sites+in+TX)

If you are using the NOAA Harvey map, you can go on to **Step 2**. Otherwise [take a screenshot and upload it using these instructions](/wiki/harvey-images#Uploading+screenshots).

See this example view of the NOAA Harvey map, near Beaumont, TX:

  
![image description](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/731/large/Screenshot_2017-09-20_at_10.42.37_AM.png "Screenshot_2017-09-20_at_10.42.37_AM.png")

  
  
## 2\. Make an entry in the spreadsheet

If you're using the NOAA map viewer, you can just copy the URL for the current view you're looking at, and it'll include the location's coordinates and a "permalink" back to that exact location. Paste this into the **Image Link** column.

_(For **non-NOAA images**, you can just add the filename and a link to where the image can be found, so just **Filename**, **Image URL**, and **Location**._

For the above image, the URL was:

https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/storms/harvey/index.html#16/30.0727/-94.0695 

(note the latitude and longitude at the end of the URL)  

We can follow up in another activity with further observations and notes, but if you can see more, go ahead and follow the instructions on the spreadsheet to fill out additional information.
