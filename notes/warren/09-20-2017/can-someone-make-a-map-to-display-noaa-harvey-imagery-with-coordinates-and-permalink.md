We are [creating a workflow](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-20-2017/compile-screenshots-and-urls-for-aerial-images-of-harvey-damages-in-a-spreadsheet-for-reporting) for folks to scan through NOAA Harvey aerial imagery to find flooding, flaring, and other pollution incidents at industrial sites:

[https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/storms/harvey/index.html](https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/storms/harvey/index.html)

The problem is that:

1. you can't see latitude and longitude on the map as you browse around
2. you can't permalink to a particular location or image so that you can share that exact view, for example in a report

I think the NOAA map is probably using some kind of standard map tile display. Can someone write a map with those features that loads the same imagery sets to make it easier for people to report pollution?

Thank you!!!
