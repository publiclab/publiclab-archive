I'm very curious about lead detection with deep UV - basically using UV in the 200-300nm range to make lead visibly glow in the visible range.

I don't see the technique listed [on this page](https://publiclab.org/notes/read_holman/12-12-2018/list-of-methods-for-lead-detection-monitoring). But doing some deeper research...

A long time ago I used a toothbrush sterilizer to try to see lead residue on a bullet casing and it didn't glow at all. But I do see the references ([https://libanswers.cmog.org/faq/143932](https://libanswers.cmog.org/faq/143932)) to "icy blue" fluorescence in glass due to lead:

> Pb (Lead) -- A strong icy-blue response, but not normally as strong as U. The fluorescence is visible under both long-wave and short-wave UV. High-lead glasses are usually colorless. The fluorescence becomes noticeable at a level of about 5%, and is strong by about 10-15%. Pb normally fluoresces more strongly than manganese or antimony. (Don't mistake the reflection of visible purple light from the UV lamp for Pb fluorescence. The Pb fluorescence is an icy-blue color and emanates from within the body of the glass.)

This page: [https://www.uvminerals.org/minerals/common-fluorescent-minerals/](https://www.uvminerals.org/minerals/common-fluorescent-minerals/) notes:

> Cerussite is a lead carbonate, and interestingly, lead is often an actuator for fluorescence in mineral specimens

and

> not all specimens of these minerals will fluoresce, as minerals typically require an ion actuator to glow

So it seems like metallic lead may not fluoresce. That said, lead dissolved in water seems to usually be an ion Pb2+...

Basically i'm a little out of my depth on the chemistry and physics of fluorescence at this point. I'm seeing articles like these talk about the use of nanodots or similar substances to make lead and copper ions fluoresce. That suggests to me that they don't on their own. So maybe I'm just barking up the wrong tree here.

The glass example mentioned at top does seem promising. Maybe it's worth shining some of these 254nm range LEDs at some older glassware. But the kind of simple detection I'd hope for would be something like this using deep enough UV and I just don't know enough to know if it's possible without a reagent:
