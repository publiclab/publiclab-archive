Web Working Group Monthly Recap 3: May 2015

It's been a quieter month than usual for the Web Working Group, at least as far as coding has gone. The big events were [last week's OpenHour](/wiki/openhour), (which actually happened in June, but let's not wait a month to celebrate it!) where fellow WWG member @btbonval, @justinmanley, and others showed up and we talked a lot about our efforts over the past year to open up PL's codebases and make them easier to contribute to.

There was also a good bit of buzz [about Leaflet.DistortableImage and MapKnitter 2.0](http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/05-29-2015/openaerialmap-open-imagery-network-public-lab-s-mapknitter) around [the 2015 State of the Map](http://publiclab.org/notes/smathermather/06-08-2015/opendronemap-openaerialmap-and-mapknitter), which is great, and has resulted in our committing to [adopt the Open Imagery Network's standard for metadata](https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/178) -- which will get us listed in their imagery directory. 

@justinmanley published a great overview of MapKnitter 2 and Leaflet.DistortableImage in a post entitled, excellently, "The Magic Behind MapKnitter: Leaflet:DistortableImage": http://publiclab.org/notes/justinmanley/05-21-2015/the-magic-behind-mapknitter-leaflet-distortableimage

###MapKnitter

Part of the excitement about MapKnitter revolved around the completion of @anishshah101's past summers' work on GPS auto-placement of images, where we used a Google Maps altitude service to calculate the height of the camera above ground level. We're [talking to folks from OpenTerrainMap to see if we can use open data](https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/176) for that feature as well. 

There's still [an outstanding bug with EXIF orientation tags](https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/181), but many images work pretty well. Here's two that've been auto-placed:

Overall, only 8 issues were closed on MapKnitter, however -- [read more in Github Pulse](https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/pulse/monthly):

###SpectralWorkbench

SW hasn't seen any activity this past month -- but again, we're hoping to get that re-started soon as my commitments to the WhereWeBreathe and Open Air projects wind up: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/pulse/monthly

Thanks to everyone and have a great week!
