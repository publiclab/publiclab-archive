The DIY [passive particle monitor][1] housing (for collecting air pollution particles to count with a microscope) is supposed to be made of stainless steel, and the test versions @mathew and others have made are aluminum. But to make it easier and cheaper to build one, could they be made of acrylic or polycarbonate? (copying in this question from [this page][2], via @mathew)

@mathew also pointed out that metal is good because **it doesn't cause static, which could attract particles** (if I understood correctly).

The [pm-dev page][2] mentions that we'd want to:

- know the consistency of low-run production units
- compare data from monitors of different materials in the same location to see if it makes a difference

We'd also want to think about weatherproofness and robustness, of course.

  
The discs are 8 inches and 5 inches, respectively, separated by 1.5 inches, and each is 1/4 inch thick.

CNC-ing services for stainless steel are prohibitively expensive, and less available to us, to DIYers, and to future universities or secondary schools that may use this monitoring methodology.

Can we make cheaper ones, and will they work as well? What are some materials options?

  
- wood?
- polycarbonate?
- thinner metal?
