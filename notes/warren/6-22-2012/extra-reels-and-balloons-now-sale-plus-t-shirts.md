If you're popped your balloon, need to fly 1000' higher, or find yourself shirtless, you are in luck! We just expanded the PLOTS store to include solutions for all three problems.

* [T-shirts](http://shop.breadpig.com/products/public-lab-balloon-mapping-tshirt) (see below) in S,M,L,XL for $20
* [1000' of string on a reel](http://shop.breadpig.com/products/balloon-mapping-reel) for high fliers: $28
* [5.5' balloons](http://shop.breadpig.com/products/5-5-chloroprene-balloon) for veteran flyers who've suffered from pops: $34

Both the reels and balloons are exactly the same as sold in our [Balloon Mapping Kits](http://shop.breadpig.com/collections/publiclaboratory/products/balloon-mapping-kit)!
