###What I want to do

Drawing on input from @stoft ([here](/n/12074)) and @ygstcu, and ideas @mathew's posted in the [community-additions](https://github.com/publiclab/spectrometer3/tree/community-additions) github branch, I wanted to try for a fully-paper slit holder in which you can swap the slit for different sizes, and which has some side support so it doesn't wilt forward or backward. Advantages of this design are:

* paper part is easy to manufacture and modify
* sturdy with side support
* swappable slits
* isolates internal optics from external box, for stability

###My attempt and results

I made this prototype (in lavender for ease of photographing, though the final will be black) which is pretty compact, open at the top, and is folded from a flat piece. You could also make in black sheet plastic, like matte plastic binder material. 

Here's the design file so far: <a href="//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/754/original/slit-holder.pdf"><i class="icon icon-file"></i> slit-holder.pdf</a>



Here's how you assemble it:

###Questions and next steps

This needs a few tweaks:

* the "dip" at the top was cut with scissors after the fact -- need to add that to the design file
* needs to be shorter and narrower; it's too tall with the wood base in place
* it could have printed arrows indicating where to align the slit
* it could have flaps above and to the side which flare out to make a better light seal

###Why I'm interested

Looking ahead to the next version of the spectrometer, I'm trying to make things more stable while not more expensive. 

Here are some of my sketches that went into this; as you can see, I'm also thinking about whether a baffle could be built into the design as well:
