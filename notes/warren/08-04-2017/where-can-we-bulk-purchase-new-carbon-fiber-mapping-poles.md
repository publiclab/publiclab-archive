# Where can we bulk purchase new carbon fiber mapping poles?

Hi, all - we've had some trouble getting a bulk order together for the Pole Mapping kit we've carried in the Public Lab Store, and have taken that product down. We know some people love this kit; now we'd like to ask if anyone can help us source them or anything like them. We sold them for $115 each.

  
The Ron Thompson Carp Gangster Pole is over 30 feet long, and made of carbon fiber segments that link together. 

  
We've taken down the page for now, but it was at https://store.publiclab.org/products/pole-mapping-kit

  
Any help appreciated!
