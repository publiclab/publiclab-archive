At the Public Lab non-profit, we are committed to the ethical and respectful use of personal information. In our work, and to serve our community and those we work with, we need to make use of personal information in a number of ways. We always seek to protect individual privacy while we fulfill our responsibilities and mission, and when these must be balanced, we seek to do so transparently and in good faith.

As part of this commitment, but also as part of our response to the new General Data Protection Regulation in Europe, today we are publishing a privacy policy which will cover all Public Lab websites and handling of personal data.

We've done our best to explain things in plain language, and as thoroughly as possible, even providing new information on IP-address anonymization at a supporting page here: [https://publiclab.org/wiki/location-privacy#Privacy+Policy+Location](https://publiclab.org/wiki/location-privacy#Privacy+Policy+Location)

Most of it affects only those people who sign up and create an account on [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org), attend an event, or otherwise interact actively with Public Lab websites and systems.

Finally, it's been our intent in this document to explain why we handle different kinds of data in order to fulfill our role hosting these spaces and fulfilling the Public Lab mission.

Please give it a look -- thank you!
