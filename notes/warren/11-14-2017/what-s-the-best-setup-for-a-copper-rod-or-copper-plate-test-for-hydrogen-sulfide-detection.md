At the #Barnraising, folks explored a few different ways of preparing copper sheets for a DIY hydrogen sulfide test (see #h2s-copper-pipe for more on this technique, where copper discolors in the presence of hydrogen sulfide, or H2S).

I saw some pretty interesting variations, aiming for

- ease of construction
- low cost
- ease of cleaning (you have to regularly scrub the copper surface with acetone)
- simplicity

What did folks come up with? Photos please!
