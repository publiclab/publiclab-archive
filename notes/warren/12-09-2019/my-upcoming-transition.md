Hello everyone!

The photo above holds two memories of when Public Lab had just begun. The first is one of the very earliest stickers we used to get the word out about Public Lab and balloon mapping -- you might not remember, but this is a variant of what you used to see in Google Maps, for much of the world where there was no good satellite imagery.

The second is my business card, from when Public Lab was barely even a thing, showing the parts that went into our earliest [balloon mapping kits](/balloon-mapping). I had both the sticker and the card printed by a small shop in Lima, Peru, along with cards for each of the other six founders. What a memory! And I still haven't given them all away.

I'm writing this post because I am making a big change in my work with Public Lab at the end of January -- in fact, **I'll be stepping down from my position as of Jan 31**. I will, however, be continuing in a part-time capacity with our [coding community](/code) as a Code Community Coordinator.

This is something I've been thinking about for a long time, and there are some big and exciting projects and ideas and adventures I want to explore. I've worked at Public Lab for 10 years (!!!), and am ready to make some changes in my life -- to try something new! Or, like, 10 or 12 or 100 new things. Many of these include work and projects in the broader Community Science movement, and I'm sure I'll be seeing you all as these plans unfold.

More on this soon, of course!

I do want to say that it's been a real pleasure to work with you all. Public Lab -- this multifaceted community we've built together, this movement we've launched -- continues to be an extraordinary adventure and collective work, and the biggest and most important project I've ever been part of.

As I get my plans together for my next steps, you'll be able to follow me on Instagram at [](https://www.instagram.com/unterbahn)@unterbahn, on Twitter at [](https://twitter.com/jywarren)@jywarren, and of course, here at [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org). Thanks, everyone!

See you at the next Barnraising!

Jeff
