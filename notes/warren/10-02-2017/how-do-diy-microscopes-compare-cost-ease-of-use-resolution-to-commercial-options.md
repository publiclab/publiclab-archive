# How do DIY microscopes compare (cost, ease of use, resolution) to commercial options?

For folks to decide whether a DIY microscope is a worthwhile approach in (for example) looking at dust pollution samples, how do some of the DIY options compare on:

* price
* resolution of a photo (in microns per pixel)
* ease of use

Keep in mind we want to compare **microscope/camera pairs**! We can only get a "microns per pixel" number to compare with if you're taking a picture through a microscope. Thanks!
