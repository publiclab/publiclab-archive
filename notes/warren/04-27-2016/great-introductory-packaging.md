# Great introductory packaging

I recently saw a [Photon Particle](https://www.particle.io/), a kind of WiFi enabled Arduino that you can program from the web in JavaScript, unboxed, and I was really impressed at the way the packaging not only welcomed the person opening it, but also provided nice initial activities and ideas for them. It was a really nice unboxing, and a reminder to me of how important that moment can be for first-timers.

I just thought I'd share some of this cool open source project's packaging design:

Note especially the insert between the breadboard and circuitboard that shows a basic starter circuit! Very nicely done.
