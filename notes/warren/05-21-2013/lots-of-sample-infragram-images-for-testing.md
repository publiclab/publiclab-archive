I went to Fresh Pond near Boston on a rainy day and took **LOTS** of [Infragram pictures](/wiki/infragram) photos which I hope will be a good sample set to work from in [developing NDVI generating software](/wiki/infragram-webapp-dev). I'm attaching some of them here, but also for a limited time [sharing a bunch using BitTorrent](/wiki/sharing-images):
