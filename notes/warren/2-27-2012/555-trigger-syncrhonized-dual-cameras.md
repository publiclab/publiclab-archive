I've been setting up a 555-based timer ([the Velleman MK111](http://cs-sales.net/veintikitras.html)) to trigger 2 cameras simultaneously (see [t-bracket dual camera rig](/wiki/t-bracket-dual-camera-rig) and [stereo camera](/tool/stereo-camera)) for infrared aerial photography. This seems to work pretty well; I don't know enough about the circuit but I wonder if I can change a resistor (maybe R2?) to lengthen the 'pause' time. Right now it goes too quickly (play the video to see)
