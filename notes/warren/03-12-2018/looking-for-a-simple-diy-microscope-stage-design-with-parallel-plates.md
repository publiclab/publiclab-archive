I came across this design via @partsandcrafts recommendation -- on this Hackteria page: https://hackteria.org/wiki/Laser-cut_microscopy_stages#LifePatch_DIY_WebCam_Microscope_Stage

@partsandcrafts noted that this could solve some focus issues with the [current Basic Microscope Kit stage](/notes/partsandcrafts/01-22-2018/building-the-microscope-stage) as well. I like that it may not require laser cutting!

Is anyone interested in giving one of these a go, ordering bolts and springs, and trying it out?

### More resources

It really seems to be really nice and simple, with two plates that could be identical, and even cut by hand out of wood. Plus these parts:

* 3 bolts
* 6 nuts
* 3 springs 

What's nice is that after Parts & Crafts' great work [on breaking this into parts](/basic-microscope), we can keep the rest of the microscope pretty much the same, and iterate on this one part. 

Although we may need to do some sourcing of these, say, on http://McMaster.com

Here are some of the links I'm searching through -- there have been quite a few iterations!
