Leif Percifield was asking about the possibility of an iPad app to view balloon images and even do a little stitching *in the field* just as images come down off a balloon. Even if this isn't the final stitch, it's nice to run through the process with such immediacy. 

Hearing this, i remembered that at Science Hack Day in San Francisco last year, some grassroots mappers did actually make an iPad app. I wasn't sure it actually allowed stitching but here's the relevant info:
