Hi, all - i'm taking a crack at a new visual organization of a Welcoming Page, starting with the existing content but then starting to think about content a bit after the basic visual organization of the page works.

I'm also riffing on the kind of welcoming tone -- specifically for newcomers -- from two sources:

1. our [Barnraising](/barnraising) "welcome" posters
2. our software [Welcoming page](https://github.com/publiclab/community-toolbox)

Here's a rough mockup making use of design patterns from the [Froala design blocks](https://www.froala.com/design-blocks):
