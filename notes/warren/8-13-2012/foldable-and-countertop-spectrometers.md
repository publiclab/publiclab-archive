In preparing for a Kickstarter campaign, I'm putting in a bit of work on two alternatives to the "desktop" spectrometer [we've been working on](/tool/spectrometer). The first is a mini spectrometer attachment for an Android phone, but not the rigid one which we're [trying to 3d print](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/7-17-2012/failed-3d-print-mobile-spectrometer-attachment). Rather, this is a cheaper, simpler fold-up one made from paper or black styrene plastic. I'm trying to get it small enough to print and ship as a postcard, which we could get out the door to Kickstarter backers almost immediately. The above is the second draft of this design. (design files coming soon, i haven't drawn them up yet)

Second, I'm working on a "countertop" model which is kind of hardened, has a sturdy stand and would come pre-calibrated, and would cost quite a bit more. It's intended for coffee shops, wine bars, classrooms, anywhere you want something  little more rugged and less hacked together. I'm thinking PVC may be a way to do this tidily, but feedback from folks at the p.irateship (my workplace) is that it still looks a little too "DIY" and that I ought to at least use nicely matched materials. I wonder if I can order colored PVC?
