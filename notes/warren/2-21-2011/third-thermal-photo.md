Here we're starting to see some actual features. I'm still not sure what the striping represents, but it seems reasonable that the darker areas at the bottom center are the windows of the room I'm in -- it's a cold day. This took an hour and a half. I think we could speed it up without going past the sensor speed, which I believe is 50hz -- this is at about 18 readings per second.
