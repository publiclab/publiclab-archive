> The lawsuit, filed last week in federal court  by the Waterkeeper Alliance and several Gulf Coast Waterkeeper organizations, aims to halt the spill and to make public the facts of the companyâ€™s seven-year response and recovery operation. The lawsuit claims that the damaged operation has been leaking several hundred gallons per day into the Gulf of Mexico.

> The spill is one of several identified in a new Gulf monitoring report released Feb. 2 by watchdog groups including SkyTruth, SouthWings, Lower Mississippi Riverkeepers and the Waterkeepers Alliance.
