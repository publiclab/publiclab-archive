CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS: The Open Hardware Scholarship!<br>
<br>
Do you have the next big Open Hardware idea, but just don?t have the funds for it?<br>
<br>
The Open Hardware Summit (OHS) is announcing its first Open Hardware scholarship this year! The purpose of the OHS scholarship is to support emerging artists/inventors and developers by providing funding for works that are released as Open Source Hardware. Granting these funds is an opportunity to draw attention to the Open Source Hardware movement, to give back to the DIY community, and to give you the chance to join a growing roster of gamechangers in Open Source Hardware history. If you have a project that is in the spirit of the OHS and supports the OHSW definition, we welcome your submissions.<br>

<br>
PRIZE<br>
Upwards of $2000 will be awarded. The scholarship is made available by the generous individuals and sponsors who have made the Open Hardware Summit possible.<br>
<br>
PUBLIC VOTE<br>
The winner will be chosen by the public. All projects will be viewable online and votes will be collected during the week of the summit. People will be able to vote on their favorite project remotely or onsite. A check will be presented to the winning artist/group at the conclusion of OHS on September 15th at the New York Hall of Science<br>

<br>

NOTES:<br>
Please feel free to email <a href="mailto:hirumi.n@gmail.com" target="_blank">hirumi.n@gmail.com</a> if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
Where does the money come from? We had $2,000 USD left over from our funds last year and we thought the best way to use it is to give it back to the community.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
