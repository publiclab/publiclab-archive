Nadya just gave me a great present -- an old Spectronic 20 spectrometer (analog...!) which we can use to compare to our designs. Though since I'm currently assembling 1000 spectrometers and desperately writing code for [SpectralWorkbench.org](http://SpectralWorkbench.org), I don't know when I'll have time to try it out...
