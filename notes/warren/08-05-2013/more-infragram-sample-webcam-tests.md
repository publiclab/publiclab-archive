Following up on [my recent posts on Infragram tests](/tag/infragram-conversion), I just received a new sample, of this webcam:

The lead image is what I see when I take a photo through it; it has no built-in infrared block filter. Then I took a photo with a Rosco #2007 filter in front:

Very dramatic! But possibly not useful, since it seems all 3 channels are being saturated with infrared light from plants. Not only do the histograms show poor differentiation between red and blue (see below), but vegetation looks basically identical in both images. Boo... moving on to the next sample...
