### What I want to do or know

Is there an easy way to make a timelapse video out of a series of images, like from a #trail-camera?

### Background story

Chris made a great video from photos from a #trail-cam in his post on our #leaffest timelapse tests:


https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/09-20-2016/zero-dark-thirsty-capturing-replenishing-nighttime-rain-events-with-a-trail-camera

And was asking others to upload some of their timelapses in this thread:

https://publiclab.org/notes/glennwalquist/12-04-2016/monitoring-sargent-sand-mining-operation-in-ludington-michigan#comments

I wanted to know what the easiest/cheapest way to do this is, so others can share their images the same way.
