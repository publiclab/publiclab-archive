# Banjo cases for carrying kite/reel

I had a funny thought today; I have a lot of trouble carrying big kites around (though Pat Coyle's ferrule-equipped kit allows breaking down big kites into shorter packages)

It occurred to me that a banjo case could accommodate the hoop winder for the string (where the drum part of the banjo is) and a shorter, ferrule-equipped kite (where the neck goes).

Anyways thought I'd share:

* [$35 5-string banjo case](http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=banjo+case&hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&biw=1238&bih=774&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=shop&cid=4900100504933233331&sa=X&ei=bEBaT7TWCYjq0gGE5cjVDw&ved=0CKwBEPMCMAc)

* [$35 backpack-style banjo case](http://bernunzio.com/product/superior-open-back-banjo/)

However, maybe using very colorful kite gear would be a good idea, you don't want people thinking you're pulling out a tommy gun.
