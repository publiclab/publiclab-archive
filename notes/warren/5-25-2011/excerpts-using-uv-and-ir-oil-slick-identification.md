Here's a great excerpt from "Remote Sensing: Principles and Interpretation" by Floyd Sabins -- an amazing textbook (written by a Chevron remote sensing expert, interestingly) which has informed a lot of the research I've been doing in multispectral sensing. Check out the book here:

This section, interestingly, covers the use of UV and near infrared imaging to identify and characterize oil sheen on water -- I'm eager to try our [UV camera](http://www.publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/4-28-2011/cheap-uv-photos-using-uv-pass-filter-cmos-camera) to detect sheens. Above, you can see where oil sheen reflects significantly more than open water in both the near UV and near IR ranges -- making our modified cameras a good candidate to pick out sheen more reliably than regular visible-light photography. I'm going to test this with some motor oil soon.
