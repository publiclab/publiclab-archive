Another update on the ongoing [migration http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/open-hardware-licensing

We are down to just a few users who haven't signed, and I've made a list of their profile pages here (these aren't folks who have refused; they simply haven't been contacted or in a couple cases haven't replied to emails yet):

It's just 11 people, so we are really almost there. If you know some of the folks on the list, please reach out to them.
