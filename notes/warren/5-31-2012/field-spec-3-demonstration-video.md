Last fall in Asheville, Adam, Shannon and I made a short video on how to use this ~$78,000 infrared/visible field spectrometer owned by Western Carolina University. We're looking at how you're supposed to use this instrument in the field, in relation to the DIY [PLOTS spectrometer](/tool/spectrometer) we're developing. Neat to see the setup for such a professional-grade tool and how it relates to our own.
