As the new [Capture interface for Spectral Workbench] has improved dramatically, the Analyze interface is starting to get left behind, and some of the more advanced functions such as calibrating spectra and cloning calibrations etc are not as easy as we'd like. They're also quite ugly. So although I've mostly been busy eating turkey, I did spend a little time on creating a new prototype Analysis interface for Spectral Workbench, which I hope to publish pretty soon. See above for a preview -- I'd love any feedback or suggestions!
