Learn to turn aerial photos into stitched web maps (or GeoTiffs) with the open source tool [MapKnitter](https://mapknitter.org). Pablo Rey and I and a few others with mapmaking experience will walk you through how to make a map with MapKnitter, discuss challenges and answer questions. If you know how to use MapKnitter, please consider stopping by and skillsharing!

###Logistics

We'll be meeting up at **[Toscanini's near Central Square, Cambridge](http://goo.gl/maps/a8OPO)** on Tuesday, December 4th between 6PM and 9PM; I'll be there the whole time and please show up promptly if you want to see the introduction demonstration.

###Tidmarsh Farms

For the walkthrough, we'll be using the images from the recent [Tidmarsh Farms mapping meetup](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/11-18-2012/tidmarsh-farms-mapping-meetup-success):

Feel free to bring your own in-progress maps to troubleshoot! Bring a laptop and a mouse if you have one.
