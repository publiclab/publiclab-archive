### What I want to do

I'd like to share files securely and privately with collaborators in certain scenarios, but it's hard to know what programs or tools are best for this. And it changes as: 

* new tools are released and improved
* vulnerabilities are discovered in old tools
* specific needs change

What are the pros and cons of each, so I can make a good decision?
