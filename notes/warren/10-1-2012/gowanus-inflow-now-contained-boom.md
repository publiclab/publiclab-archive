Visiting the Gowanus Canal yesterday I ran across some canoers who helped Chris and I get some good sediment samples. More on that soon but I also noticed that the site of the plume [discovered by balloon mappers in August 2011](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/liz/8-3-2011/infrared-balloon-image-reveals-gowanus-plume) has been surrounded by an inflated boom (see above image). I assume Whole Foods has done this, and Liz told me they removed the metal plate which had been used to cover the inflow site. Does anyone else know about this? Why is it being boomed? Interesting.
