Over at https://publiclab.org/wiki/timelapse and https://publiclab.org/wiki/photo-monitoring, we've been collecting info on trail cameras as a way to monitor polluters. These cost about $100 each.

But after seeing [all the amazing cheap and weatherproof GoPro camera](/questions/warren/05-20-2017/cheap-lightweight-gopro-alternatives-for-aerial-mapping) "clones" you can get, some with WiFi, and claiming 4K quality video, I wondered if the zillions of GoPro users out there have done any hacking to get them running for weeks at a time, and outdoors. I found a little bit:

Do other folks know more about this, or have other advice on ways to do long-term outdoor monitoring for somewhat under $100?
