Jen Hudon posted last week about mapping in Humboldt Park in Chicago. Sounds like they had a blast! She writes:

> We had quite a few technical difficulties on Saturday for the Chicago Grassroots Mapping Workshop, including a broken kite string reel, not enough helium, and a malfunctioning camera. However, the team remained optimistic and had a great time learning more about the Public Laboratory and the many grassroots mapping projects, all while experimenting with cameras, mylar balloons and kites. The group was very interested and impressed with all of the collaborations and developments with the software and hardware - so kudos to everyone involved.
