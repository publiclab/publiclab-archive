A user interface question: many sites these days show notifications -- a little box that pops up in the corner of your screen, slightly different depending on what kind of computer you have -- or pops up an alert on your phone if that's your device. 

They look like this on my computer (a chromebook):

We could probably make it possible for people to subscribe to these to PublicLab.org if someone answers a question they have posted, or replies to a comment they've made. Not everyone will want these, but some people might.

Does anyone like these, or feel like we should explore notifications on the Public Lab website for some limited purposes?
