# Spectral Workbench user login system

Users of [Spectral Workbench](https://spectralworkbench.org) may have noticed some minor hiccups this morning as new features were added. Most importantly, you can now log into the site using your PublicLaboratory.org username. This unified login system will also soon be rolled out on [MapKnitter.org](https://mapknitter.org). 

###"Claiming" your spectra###

Most importantly, in order to associate spectra you've uploaded with your new account, please first log in with your PublicLaboratory.org username, then email [web@publiclaboratory.org](mailto:web@publiclaboratory.org) and we'll connect it up.

The login system will allow for easier management of your spectra, make it easier to contact and discuss data with other contributors, and will stop spambots and newbies from messing up your calibrations.

Spectral Workbench client software will now prompt you to log in as you upload new spectra. This may be a little cumbersome right now but we are refining the system to make things as painless as possible. 

If you have any trouble with the login system please contact the Web working group (email above), or submit bug reports at http://github.com/jywarren/spectral-workbench/issues/new
