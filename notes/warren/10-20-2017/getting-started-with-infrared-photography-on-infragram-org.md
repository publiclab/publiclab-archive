This tutorial walks through working with images on [Infragram.org](infragram.org), which is an easy way to process your infrared/visible images online.

For more about DIY infrared photography, what it's for, #NDVI, or anything else we've talked about in this tutorial, see the [Infragram page](/wiki/infragram). Here, we'll start with the assumption that you:

- have an image from an [Infragram](/wiki/infragram)-type single-image camera, and not working with two separate images for visible and infrared
- you've set a custom white balance, especially if you're using an [Infragram Point & Shoot](/wiki/infragram-point-shoot)
- you are familiar with [NDVI](/wiki/ndvi) and want to get an NDVI image from your image

## Steps

Generally, the steps include:

1. uploading an image
2. choosing a preset
3. choosing a color map if you didn't in Step 2
4. saving and/or downloading the image

## Tutorial

This video walks you through these basics in just a few minutes. If you have questions, please post them here!
