The [DIY Spectrometry Kickstarter project](kickstarter.com/projects/jywarren/public-lab-diy-spectrometry-kit) is humming along as Mathew Lippincott is [up to his elbows in foldable paper spectrometers]() out in Portland, and here in Somerville, we are preparing for our own big assembly of desktop spectrometry kits. I know all you KS backers are eager to see our progress, so here are some photos and other updates! Apologies for slow responses to your messages and comments; please bear with us as we get these rewards out the door.

###Foldable spectrometers

Mathew spent a lot of time cutting up DVDs, which will be shipping with your foldable spectrometers. I get to do this tomorrow.

This is what you'll be receiving shortly if you selected the foldable spectrometer reward!

###DIY spectrometry kits

The black paper inserts, conduit boxes, and other parts have been steadily flowing into our workspace in Somerville (the Pirateship). The inserts are now being lasercut.

The 800+ lbs of aluminum conduit boxes which are our new spectrometer enclosures were the most dramatic:

Finally, we stickered a few with our new labels, assembled final packaging, and did a quick photo shoot. Gorgeous!
