Here's a first attempt to vectorize the design for the mini foldable spectrometer. I had to expand the postcard size to 5x7" but we'll see if we can shrink it back down. Also I added a "window" to put the diffraction grating over. Still to do:

* add dotted lines for folds
* print it and test geometry
* figure out easier way to sturdily form a tube (the flap to close the tube is a little narrow)
* add spectral workbench prism logo
* test slit width
* attempt slit cutting with laser cutter
* try it on different phones for camera focus issues
* add more instructions outside the foldable form (like how to cut and attach a grating)
* try mailing one!

And more... soon! Try it out and post your experiments, let's chip away at this list!

**Update:** I made some changes after trying out the above design, and added some instructions. The updated file is also attached now.

**Update:** More changes, showing which are valley folds, and a small illustration of the assembled device.

**Update:** I lasercut again (photos soon) and made a few more revisions. This should be the final version!! [Download the 2.7 version](https://publiclab.org/sites/default/files/mini-spectrometer-2.7.pdf)

**Update:** One more version! I re-did the layout and added some minimal design tweaks, but mainly did this so it would fit a stamp and address without messing up the solid black back-side with postal cruft.
