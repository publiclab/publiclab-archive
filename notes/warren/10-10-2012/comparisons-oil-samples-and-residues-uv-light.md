More tests of different oil residues (and olive oils) in UV light (from a UV CFL) are yielding some nice images. I'm going to be doing my best to measure spectra of these soon. Above, two different olive oils. Below, in order:

* suspected motor oil residue from a street drain in Somerville in mineral oil
* baby oil (mineral oil, used to leach out oils from the other samples)
* residue from the 2010 BP oil spill in mineral oil
* another sample of residue from the 2010 BP oil spill in mineral oil
