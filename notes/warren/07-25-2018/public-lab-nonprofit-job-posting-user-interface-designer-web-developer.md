Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science: User interface designer/web developer

Start Date: Late July 2018

Location: Remote

Terms: Contract

The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (Public Lab) is a community--supported by a 501(c)(3) non-profit--which develops and applies open-source tools to environmental exploration and investigation. By democratizing inexpensive and accessible Do-It-Yourself techniques, Public Lab creates a collaborative network of practitioners who actively re-imagine the human relationship with the environment.

We are looking for a contract-based user interface designer and web developer to work on two projects related to UI/UX, usability, accessibility, and graphic design of specific pages on [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org) over the next six weeks. These small projects are focused on the information design and initial orientation moment with a specific focus on communities with oil and gas issues, making it easier to a) find resources related to the issues they care about, b) understand how the site can help them, c) identify, understand, and navigate resources related to their issue of interest, and d) see and interact with others who share these interests or concerns.

[PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org) is a Ruby on Rails website with:

- Bootstrap interface
- Mobile/desktop compatible UI
- Open source code available at [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/)

Candidates should have experience with:

- user interface/user experience design
- implementing/coding HTML and some JavaScript
- communicating publicly with and soliciting and integrating input from a diverse community
- work on open source projects and/or with open source communities
- git/Github workflow (we can provide support on this)

Browse some of our initial design steps and general design principles here: [https://publiclab.org/ui](https://publiclab.org/ui)

The two design projects we are seeking design work for are described on these two pages; each will include a stipend of $1000:

- [https://publiclab.org/n/15796](https://publiclab.org/n/15796)
- [https://publiclab.org/q/16271](https://publiclab.org/q/16271)

  
  
Please send a single document containing, resume, portfolio (or link to an online portfolio), and link to your Github profile (or equivalent) to [jobs@publiclab.org](mailto:jobs@publiclab.org) **by August 1**. No phone calls please. Public Lab has no geographic preference for where this position is located.

Public Lab is an equal opportunity employer committed to a diverse, multicultural work environment. We encourage people with different ability sets, people of color, and people of diverse sexual orientations, gender expressions and identities to apply.
