Hi, all! I wanted to reach out because we will have a record-size team this summer, between 2 Outreachy and 13 GSoC fellows --- we've never had a group this big! We also have a bigger mentor group, but we will certainly need students to help one another. I wanted to reach out and welcome everyone, but also set the tone for the kind of mutual support we will need to succeed together.

Here are the announcements - congratulations!!!:

I was thinking of asking people individually to keep an eye on someone else's work even as they do their own. Each person might have a set of skills they could use to help another with -- whether it's writing tests, making FTOs, solving database issues, designing UIs, or creating clear and simple documentation. We'll need to rely on each other --- students helping students above all --- to pull this off and ensure everyone has a great summer, learns a lot, and finds success!

A note to those who we weren't able to accept in this year's program: we had over 20 fantastic proposals, and if we had the slots available and the mentoring team, we would surely have accepted more. Please know that we are extremely grateful for your work with us to date and that we welcome you to continue being part of this community. We considered many factors, among which are the prioritization of different projects, our ability to support different kinds of projects with good mentorship, and much more. So our inability to accept you should not be taken in a discouraging way, or as a suggestion that your proposal and your skills were not impressive and exciting on their own merits. Thank you for understanding and we hope you'll apply again :heart:
