This is pretty cool -- when I was at [Mystic Brewery](http://mystic-brewery.com), i got to try out Brian's refractometer -- subject of much debate on the mailing list some months ago. It was not calibrated but it was neat just to see how it works -- a white zone is cast onto a graduated display from light entering the tube through a "smeared" droplet. I figured folks would like to see some photos, so here you go!
