I visited [Toscanini's](http://tosci.com) in Central Square, Cambridge, today, and Gus and Lucy were very willing to nerd out with me and the [countertop spectrometer prototype](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jywarren/public-lab-diy-spectrometry-kit). Lucy brought over samples of all their coffees and we collected some spectra of each.

I have to reformat the spectrum graphs so the labels don't run over the data! But in any case we scanned:

* Barisimo Clockwork espresso
* Barisimo Deanimator decaf espresso
* Barisimo La Fatima light roast brewed coffee
* Dancing Goats dark roast brewed coffee

We did not measure the amount of coffee we put in, which we probably ought to do (we did [at Mystic Brewery](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/8-28-2012/spectral-yeast-tests-mystic-brewery) yesterday -- 25 ml each). But you can still see some interesting variation. This isn't quite science yet... just a proof of concept. It'd be very interesting to gather a lot of data, and see if there are really consistent differences.
