I just wanted to post up a quick note about the importance of using appropriete eye wear when using ANY kind of laser within close proximity of you or anyone else, the reason is simple...you only have one pair of eyeballs, try and keep them for as long as possible!

As benign as it may seem when using even laser pointers, they still have the ability to harm your eyes very quickly without you even knowing it until it's too late, below is a picture of what I use when operating my UV laser pointer or green laser pointer, these green safety glasses block both the green and blue laser light and it only cost me 9 dollars.
