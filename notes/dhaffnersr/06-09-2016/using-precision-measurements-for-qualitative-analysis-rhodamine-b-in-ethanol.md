**Abstract**

Part two in this series on precision measurements; building on what we have learned so far, the plot for figure 1 shows that sample number 1 @ 0.1 ml concentration, brings us within 5nm of the wavelength taken by the Oregon Medical Laser Center's scan of Rhodamine B in Ethanol (565nm).

Further, it can be seen that the higher the concentration levels become, the greater the wavelength is shifted to the right of the spectrum.
