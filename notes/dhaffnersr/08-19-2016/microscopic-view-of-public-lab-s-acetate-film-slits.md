I have wanted to do this for awhile now, and finally got around to it and I am glad I did, I took my microscope today and examined the 0.09mm slit (one of 4 that comes with the Plab kit you can order, for various slit widths,) as I had suspected there are many imperfections riddled throughout the slit entrance area.


[![09mm_slit_at_100x_magnification_aug19_both_pictues.png](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/686/large/09mm_slit_at_100x_magnification_aug19_both_pictues.png)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/686/original/09mm_slit_at_100x_magnification_aug19_both_pictues.png)

I'm not sure if these imperfections really pose any real attenuation of signal exiting the slit or distortion effects, but I am going to try an open air slit design of the same size and see if there is any difference.

Any comments or questions are welcomed.
