I finally figured out how to calculate the quantum yield for a sample, so using the raw data from the Oregon Medical Laser Center's spectral data (which thanks to Warren and his upgrade to the CSV beta upload, now it is very easy to upload this raw emission data and use it in a meaningful way.)

So I was able to transfer the raw data to spekwin32 and process it so I could compare it to my data for fluorescein. The data for the Laser center is fluorescein in ethanol, but their spectra is a true spectra with no PL artifacts in it.

The reason I am using KBr (potassium bromide) has been explained in my previous research note, but I was able to calculate it's quantum yield, and I'm 95 percent sure its accurate.
