The reason I ran this series of experiments was to test the attenuation effects that glass and even quartz can have on captured data and if that effect has any real impact on final quality data analysis, here are the results below.

I really would like some feedback on this because on the data for the UV LED, I suspect that the inverse square law might actually have an effect on the path length of glass on quartz.
