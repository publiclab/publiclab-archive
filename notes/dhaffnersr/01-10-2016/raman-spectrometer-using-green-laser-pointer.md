I want to build a simple but effective Raman spectrometer for analyzing inorganic particulates in public water ways, drinking water, rivers and streams, ect., using a 535 nm green laser pointer.

I have posted a few pics of my set up so far and have run a few trial runs.

My next steps are to fine tune this set up and utilize a by-pass filtering method for the laser light.

I am interested in this because I love science and I am a retired Navy Vet so I have some time now to pursue some interests that matter to me.
