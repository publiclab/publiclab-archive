# FLUORESCENCE OF 87 OCTANE GASOLINE

Today I was doing some calibrating for fluorescing gasoline and oil samples

###My attempt and results = using a 395 nm UV flashlight and green laser pointer you can see that the gasoline fluoresces nicely, and with the green laser the sample will also fluoresce and the beam will be an Amber color.

If you notice in a couple of the blue pics, the laser light is slightly widened using a 1.5 X erecting eye piece from a telescope. I think my next set of pics I may use my HD video camera instead of my cell phone for a higher quality color picture.
