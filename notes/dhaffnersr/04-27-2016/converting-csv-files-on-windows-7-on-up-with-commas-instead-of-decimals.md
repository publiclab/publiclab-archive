upon trying to use the new csv (beta) version here at Plab, I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get my csv files to upload...well, it was because they were in decimal format!

I reported this anomaly to warren, (thinking I had just discovered some little annoying bug,) but alas, it was me! Jeff was of invaluble help on this matter, and instead of me trying to explain it to you, I will show you just how easy it is to rectify this little problem. 

Now some of the features I have on windows 7 may appear a little different on your system but the concept is still very similar,
