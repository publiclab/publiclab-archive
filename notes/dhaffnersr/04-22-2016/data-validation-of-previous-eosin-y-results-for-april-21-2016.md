Using my Aries series green laser, I wanted to validate the Eosin Y study I did the other day with the Prolight Uv LED (410nm). I'm presenting this study as a final result for this series of tests using my plab v2.5 spectrometer (build 3.0)

Reason for doing this: I have been following the progress of plab's v3.0 spectrometer for Iphones ect., and I have not seen one example of any kind of analytical data collection, (ie.,chemical analysis,spectral signature analysis of any organic compounds.)

There was a question posed here recently by a university about a very unique and serious study begin conducted to update a bee pollen data base that hasn't been touched or updated since the 1970's. They asked if WE could help them by doing the field work of taking the spectral data signatures of bee colonies and their pollen, quite a lofty and very noble endeavor.

I just can't see the logic in even entertaining such an idea if the version 3.0 hasn't matured to the point of getting past "proof of concept." What I mean by this is, until someone starts to upload and present some data and research notes on some kind of organic spectral analysis WITH quantative validation, then it is still sitting in the realm of just a very fancy light source spectrometer.

What I pose to all of you using the version 3.0 is this, my recent work on Eosin Y is very detailed on sample preparation and it is not very difficult to replicate, I have laid it out very clearly for you. This research paper that I present to you here is a validation of that said research on Eosin Y, using my version 2.5 Plab spectrometer kit. Anyone should be able to repeat what I have done here using their Plab version 3.0 spectrometer.

Good luck!

Sample preparation:
2 cuvettes, one for the Blank (0.1M NaOH in 20 % ethanol) and one for samples S1 thru S6.
Volume capacity calculations- 1 drop of eosin y (1 % aqueous solution) = 0.058g
To convert to micro liters take 0.058g*1000 = 58 microliters
Sample(1)-1 drop	58 microliters
Sample(2)-2 drops	127 microliters
Sample(3)- 3 drops	189 microliters
Sample(4)- 4 drops	254 microliters
Sample(5)- 5 drops	320 microliters
Sample(6)- 6 drops	372 microliters
Each scan will last 30 seconds.
Excitation source- 532nm Aries series green laser (20mW)
