Fig.1	A very interesting way I figured out to export laser data from workbench, (since calibration cannot be done on only one data point.) is, I will take the spectral image with the UV laser pointer, using the “save and calibrate later” option and copy a CFL calibration on top of the UV data, (now you have to make sure you have an excellent CFL calibration of at least 4 or 5 on your quality fit.) Then check the raw data real quick to make sure you have your wavelength numbers in there, and the way I do it is export as a CSV file to my analyzing software and open it up using only the XYYYY option which as you can see gives you all the RGB lines along with it, now on my software all I have to do if I don’t want to see all that I just remove the selected spectrums and walla!

The picture to the right is one I took this summer where I live at about 6am.
