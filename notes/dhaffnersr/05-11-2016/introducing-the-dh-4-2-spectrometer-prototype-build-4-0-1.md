###What I want to do
 
1) To construct a reliable and accurate spectrometer 
2) To make it cost effective 
3) Easy to construct and modify 
4) Durable and portable for field work

###My attempt and results

After 3 months of severe trial and error, based upon the original design by Public lab version 2.5 spectrometer kit, I have finally constructed and tested my own version and design. I have kicked it, dropped it from 4 feet and she has stayed in alignment and operates normally. (NOT waterproof!)

With this particular build-4.0.1, I have ran over 500 spectral tests and analysis, I will be posting those results shortly but I wanted to post this because I am quite proud of my work here and I feel I have met 3.5 terms of my stated goal.

###Questions and next steps

The next step is to field test it, with laptop in hand and do some real work!

###Why I'm interested

This started out as a curiosity science project for me, then I started to really get interested once I started imaging spectra's and analyzing them. Now I am so hooked, I just had to find out just how far I could take this little project (that's the engineer in me,) and see how accurate and reliable I could make it.
