Below is my final data analysis for the 10w40 sample I have been working on, I have been working hard on perfecting my sample preparation techniques and data analysis using spekwin32, So I really DO NOT mind a very critical analysis of my data and sample processing technique, its the only way I'm going to learn and know if I am progressing or what I need to do in order to do better quality work.

I have found something very interesting though, but I will have to do a more thorough comparison to find out why I got better results with the 400nm LED than with the 405nm UV laser, now I had similar peak values as compared to the 400nm scans but the concentration levels were much lower, maybe it's because of the higher energy levels, I'm not sure which readings are more accurate, but I know there are those here with much more experience with this type of work than I.

Well anyway here it is:
