###What I want to do:
Using the new spekwin32 v172.2P3 hardware control prototype software, I wanted to try it's capabilities out and do an analysis of A rhodamine b standard.

ref: ethanol
**sample 1-rhod b 100ppm
sample 2-100ppb**

To prepare a 100-ppb standard of rhodamine B or other dye in powder form:
1. First, prepare a 100-fold dilution by weight. Using an accurate laboratory scale, weigh 1 gram of dye directly into a 100-ml volumetric flask. Then dilute to the mark with distilled water. (Be sure to mix thoroughly; the powders can be difficult to mix.) You now have a 10-g/liter (10-ppt, 10-2) -concentration of your tracer.
Note: You could obtain the same -concentration by weighing 10 g into a 1-liter flask, or 20 g into a 2-liter flask.
2. Next, pipette 1 ml (or weigh 1 gram) of the dilution in #1 (10-2 or 10 ppt) into a clean 100-ml volumetric flask and dilute to the mark with distilled water. Mix thoroughly. You now have a 10-4, or 100-ppm, dilution.
3. Now, pipette 1 ml (or weigh 1 gram) of the dilution in #2 (10-4 or 100 ppm) into a clean 1-liter volumetric flask and fill to the mark with system water. Mix thoroughly. You now have a 10-7 (or 100-ppb; 0.1-ppm) standard.
