This research is in direct relation to my previous testing of 2 stroke motor oil. I have also included 4 oil samples, each dissolved in a different solvent for comparison purposes and understanding the difference between polar and non-polar solvents and compounds. 

The second purpose of these tests are also to demonstrate the importance in using the correct solvent for the compound that is to be tested, in order to gather accurate and valid results.

Thirdly, these tests will further demonstrate that the complete homogenizing of sample and solvent, will in no way compromise data gathering with a spectrometer.

Samples including the control and blank, are the same as in the last series of tests.
