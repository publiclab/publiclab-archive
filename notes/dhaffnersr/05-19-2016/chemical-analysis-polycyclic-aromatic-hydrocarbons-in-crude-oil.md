**Abstract**
This is a continuation from my previous research on 05/18/2016. 

Chemical analysis on 2 crude oil samples from that study, plus one done on a sample dissolved in Ethanol revealed the most common PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) that exist in crude oils, Benzo[a]pyrene.

All procedures and preparations for samples are the same, and are outlined in detail here: http://publiclab.org/notes/dhaffnersr/05-18-2016/crude-oil-analysis-sweet-crude-laramine-county-carpenter-wyoming-usa

The procedure used for preparation of the crude oil sample in Ethanol is outlined here: http://publiclab.org/notes/dhaffnersr/04-29-2016/uv-laser-pointer-405nm-5mw-2-stroke-motor-oil-related-testing-apr-29-2016

The sample containing the crude oil dissolved in Ethanol, is a clear example of a non-polar solvent not rendering a complete dissolution, this process is illustrated here: http://publiclab.org/notes/dhaffnersr/04-29-2016/uv-laser-pointer-405nm-5mw-2-stroke-motor-oil-related-testing-apr-29-2016

 So, I examined the top (opaque) layer which is perfectly acceptable too, and these are the results:

 Again, the graph above illustrates the Urbach tail and a surprising degree of resolution in the sample dissolved in Ethyl acetate, which it's reference FWHM was-24 @ 400nm and that of Ethanol was FWHM 31 @ 402nm with an excitation wavelength of 390nm [Uv LED].
