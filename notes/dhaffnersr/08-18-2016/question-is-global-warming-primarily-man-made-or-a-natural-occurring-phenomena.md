My personal opinion on this subject is that, there has always been warming and cooling trends on this planet for millions of years and I think that since the beginning of the 20th century, as far as global warming is concerned, humans have contributed  a far smaller percentage to this seemingly growing trend in our weather patterns.

I am asking, because I would be interested to know about other's insight or knowledge about this subject.
