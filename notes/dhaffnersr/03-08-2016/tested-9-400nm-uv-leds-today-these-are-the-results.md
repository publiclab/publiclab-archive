I bought 9 400nm LEDs from superbrightleds.com and I was curious as to their consistency for use in UV spectral analysis, well, I got some very interesting but not too surprising results. 

I also metered out each LED under load and those results are displayed as well.

Although there are 4 LEDs that display the same Fv (3.58 and 3.60) their spectral consistency is NOT to be trusted.

Any questions or comments are always welcomed!
