This is a collaborative research proposal introduced by Jeff Warren, asking me if I would help in conducting some testing of various light sources on different sample media.

I am presenting the initial test set-up for consideration and community feedback, and certainly welcome all input to possible changes or ideas to make this experiment a success.

Here is the initial draft for the set-up:

* pure mineral oil
* pure ethanol
* pure motor oil (being clear which you have)
* X drops of crude oil diluted in mineral oil
* X drops of crude oil diluted in ethanol

"Clear photos of the entire setup and labelled photos of all the samples will be good. We'll also need to document the cuvette materials."

•	4 light types (3 LEDs and 1 laser) in exactly the same positions
•	mineral oil negative control
•	one sample of motor oil
•	a calibration reference

Here are a set of pictures of the light sources:

Here is a picture of the sample container tubes:

Please, we need some feedback on this to make it a success!

Thanks!
