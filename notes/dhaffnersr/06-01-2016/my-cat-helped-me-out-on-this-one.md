I finally was able to do a 4 sample concentration study with Eosin Y in Ethanol, for some odd reason I had to fend off one of my cats (tee tee,) who apparently found what I was doing very interesting and decided she could help too!

I did this study because I had to re-do the DVD grating and reposition it, somehow it moved out of position. My results are posted below.
