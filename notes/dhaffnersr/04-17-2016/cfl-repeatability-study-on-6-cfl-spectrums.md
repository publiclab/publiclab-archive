I scanned 6 CFL spectrums for 1 hour at 10 minute time exposures each and here are the results:

Below are the graphs processed on Spekwin32 spectrometry editing software, only sspike removal and baseline correction were done as to preserve the integrity of the spectra in raw data form.

This next graph shows my control spectrum, the CFL was allowed to cool down and the detector was unplugged for 1 hour also.
