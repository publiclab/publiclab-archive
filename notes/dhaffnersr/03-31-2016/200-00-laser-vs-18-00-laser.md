I wanted to know if there really was a difference between an expensive green laser and a very cheap one, so here are the results of those tests:

The first graph will show the Aries 532nm green laser, cost-$200.00 and the second graph will show the results for the $18.00 green laser pointer under the exact conditions.


Aries 532nm green laser.

Generic 532nm green laser pointer.
