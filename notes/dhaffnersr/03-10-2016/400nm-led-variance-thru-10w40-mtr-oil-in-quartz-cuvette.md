Here are the results of my testing today at the request of Jeff, I took the same LEDs that I tested on March 8th and ran the same procedure but this time with a sample (10w40 motor oil, only because I don't have any access to crude) thru a Quartz cuvette.

Also I made a set of my scans today, https://spectralworkbench.org/sets/3211  set for LED variance test Mar10th/9 LEDs tested thru 10w40 motor oil
