##**These are 4 EEM graphic plots showing the before and after effects of removal of Rayleigh/Raman Scattering of the spectral captured data.**



**Here is the first 2 plots illustrating the removal of the 1st and 2nd order Rayleigh peaks, and the removal of Raman scattering.**

**These next 2 plots show the before and after effects**

**Here is the Emission plot of the sample of crude oil using my UV laser pointer as the excitation source**

Some conclusions, I am satisfied with this body of evidence from this latest research and the past two research notes I have posted on the difference between using Plab's acetate film strips as slits and using a much more stable and reliable open-air design such as the Gillette Metal razor blade 0.11mm slit I constructed.
