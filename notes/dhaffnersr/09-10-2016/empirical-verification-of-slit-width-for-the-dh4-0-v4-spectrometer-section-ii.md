##**Verification through quality control check procedures**



Using my Premeire Professional binocular microscope, I verified my new slit template and design. The razor blades are now mounted on a piece of polycarbonate for strength and rigidity, which upon microscopic inspection reveals that indeed, both edges appear horizontal in respect to their positions.

Exact measurements are noted on the title image. (note_all original data is available upon request.)

Slit width length according to specifications are; 1) Length = 34mm, Width = 0.06mm
2) Template dimensions: Length = 63.49mm, Height = 44.44mm
3) Template thickness: 1.69mm

Razor blades used: Gillette utility knife blades (standard size)

I measured my spectral bandwidth using the FWHM value of my 150mW laser data as shown in figure.2, the reason for this is because my laser's performance at specifications are highly reliable and very repeatable, so I trust the data. I understand that there are a few here at Plab, that question my results and methods, what I have to say to those individuals is, prove my data incorrect, don't just make innuendos, get your spectrometer out and show me how its done, talk is cheap.
