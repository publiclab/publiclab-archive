This is actually a follow up on my previous post on the two laser scans using the new 0.05mm slit width. I wanted to verify the width using my microscope, since the image capture program, AMScope has a pretty awesome measurement feature, also this is the first time I have used it with the measurement feature layered on the image itself, and didn't realize I could export it to Excel.

This made life a lot easier, because I couldn't figure out why it wouldn't let me save it as a compatible image file that would save the measurements, thank heavens for help files!

I will be remaking this image again with more measurement information on it, because over 90 percent of the length conformed to the tolerance expected of 0.05mm, only from a section at 0.29mm almost at center, did I measure a slight deviation at a slope of 0.0059653nm from a starting point of; 0.0207753nm.

This particular slit took me over 2 hours of very tedious work to get it just right and perfect, but it was well worth the effort!
