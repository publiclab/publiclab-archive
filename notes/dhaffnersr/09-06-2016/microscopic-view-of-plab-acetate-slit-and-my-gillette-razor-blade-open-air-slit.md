Using my Premiere professional binocular microscope (model - 3000,) and a new camera I got for it; an AmScope MD-500 5 megapixel HD cmos camera, I was finally able to image both slits at 100 X magnification with great clarity, here is what they look like;

As in a previous post I did with a very blurry image of the Plab slit, these are some very telling images I would say.
