As of 2017 there are several consumer hand held Refractometers/Spectrometers/(Lasers) available working in conjunction with SmartPhones providing basic Brix Data that elude to taste/quality of fruit or vegetables....utilizing similar technology, **would it be possible to extrapolate the approximate value of Phytonutrients in Fruit/Vegetables** as well?  

What reference data would be required to accurately acquire such data from said subject?

Would the initial reference data need to be acquired using standard lab techniques?
