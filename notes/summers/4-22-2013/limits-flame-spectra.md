Flame emission spectroscopy can be used to quantify certain metals because light of characteristic wavelengths is given off when these metals are heated in a flame.  The physical phenomenon occurs when low energy electrons are excited into higher energy orbitals by heat from the flame and light is emitted when the electrons drop back to their ‘ground’ state.  The characteristic yellow flame observed when sodium ions are introduced to a Bunsen burner is the classic example.  The practical limitation on measuring elements by this method relates to the temperatures available from a flame.  According to Wikipedia (fountain of all knowledge), temperatures in natural gas flames range between 1200 and 1800 K.  Unfortunately, a limited number of elements have electronic energy transitions that can be excited by these temperatures.   Since the energy of light is inversely proportional to wavelength, more energy is needed to excite elements that emit at shorter wavelengths.  Mendham, et al (1), recommend using flame emission for elements that emit at wavelengths longer than 400 nm (Table below, left column).    Elements that emit at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm (right hand column) can be quantified by atomic emission, but these elements are typically excited using a source called Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP).  ICP can reach temperatures of ~15000 K and is really not a recommended method for the DIY set.
