Dear all,

I'm using the MS LifeCam Studio with a resolution of 1920x1020 pixels for my spectrometer but I did not use a diy-kit from spectral. When I connenct the webcam with the button "Capture Spectra" to Spectral, the program shows just 639 Pixels at the x-axis. Does somebody know if it's possible to get a higher resolution connecting directly the webcam to Spectral??

If it isn't, I've already found a possible solution of the problem but I don't know if it works with the calibration function. I can capture a spectra with another programm on the computer. Before uploading the spectra with a resolution of 1920x1020 I have to edit the picture because it is too large. Once uploaded, spectral shows me a resoluton of 1920 Pixels but I don't know if it is possible to calibrate a spectrum with a higher resolution than 639 Pixels...

Thank you all for helping me with this problems... :-)
