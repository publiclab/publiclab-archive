I removed the IR filter in my camera Phantom 3 professional that is already equipped with a NIR Sentera, I added the filter (red) infragram front of the lens, so you can also change other filter types. The problem that is reflected on the white balance. The drone can be managed with specific applications for the flight and the photograph although, to make findings of extensive vegetation it is necessary to perform an automatic route "nadir" in which shots are executed in sequence georeferenced which then can be processed using such software Agisoft PhotoScan or Pix4D mapper, to create a unique geo-referenced photos (orthophotos). These applications (at least the ones I know until now) do not allow the white balance, it is the only pix4D Capture but has only three options: auto, sunny and cloudy. For now I have tried to balance the white with the native application of the Phantom 3 (DJGO) which still has a number of more complete balance options (auto, sunny, cloudy, incandescent light, fluorescent light) at least to get an idea, I would like know if the photo that forwarding is close to the correct balance. In addition, in the event that generate an orthophoto, I should process it later with the plugin FIJI (could be 500 mb of photos) or individual photo shoots before processing, without losing the EXIF information about photos (Otherwise the photogrammetry software fail to develop). I apologize for any errors, but I'm using a translator.
Thanks in advance to those who will be able to help me, greetings
