###What I want to do or know
I would like this spectrometer to be on a ground vehicle to identify dandelions. I was wondering if this will be applicable outside, say in a backyard?  It would need the capability to identify a dandelion vs. a leaf and then a specified task would be performed. Please let me know if you require any extra information. I am currently a senior at Rutgers University.
###Background story
This is a capstone project for our senior mechanical engineering group. We are currently looking for an object that can accurately identify plants.
