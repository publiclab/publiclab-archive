Dear all,

I acquired a DIY Infragram camera today.
The device is pretty cool, and I can see the NIR image.

I would like to code in C++, through OpenCV a specific software which transform the NIR image to the NDVI format.

I just know that I need to do the simple equation (NIR - Red Channel)/(NIR + red Channel), taking in account that the NIR channel replace the Red channel.

Could you help me giving me an algorithm to do this please ?
I have a single NIR camera, nothing more.

Thanks for your kind reply.

All the best,
