I'm a student at a Environmental Science Lab at NCCU and we have been trying to get our Benchtop Evaporator set up, but since it has been out of production since 2005, we cannot get support from the manufacturer.

Does anyone know someone who may be able to give us some advice?

Much appreciated,

Brian
