Our second attempt was in a bedroom in an older apartment. We tested the apartment on November 24, 2014 at 6:45pm. The outside temperature at this time was 58 degrees Fahrenheit. We set the temperature on the Arduino program between 72 to 76 degrees Fahrenheit. The average temperature of the room was 73 degrees, which is displayed by the yellowish-light. 

We tested the entire wall by the window, and then the bottom wall. 
The thermal images mostly portrayed green/yellowish light.
