Our group attempted to provide the best case for our thermal flashlight possible.

We used a sewing kit container and duct tape to keep the flashlight in a stable setting. It is small and able to be handheld. 

Should we have attached a long handle to the container so we can test thermal insulation from a far distance? 

There should be an easier way to use the thermal flashlight than to hold the two plates
