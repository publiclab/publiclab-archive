###What I want to do or know

Need to map trees deep in the rainforest.
No connectivity at the location 5 hours upriver.
Ideally output would be a data table.

###Background story

The largest trees in the Amazon are called Shihuahuaco trees and they are in danger of illicit logging. This census will likely feed a tree adoption project in order to monitor and protect these giants.

###What I've tried

I took a short look at OpenTreeMap but it looks overly complex for our needs. I'm thinking of writing one. Can you recommend a tool for the job? Thanks!
