Hi,

We are contemplating helping our neighborhood security by proposing a community surveillance system.

This is to be used in the Amazon Rainforest (where it's humid, rainy, sunny, hot).

Please review a short list of components:

- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- MicroSD Card
- Pi Camera (w/night vision)
- Solar controller / charger
- Battery (capacity?)
- Solar panel (capacity?)

Also, what kind of casing should we use?

How durable can we expect it to be?

Thank you in advance for your advice on the above!
