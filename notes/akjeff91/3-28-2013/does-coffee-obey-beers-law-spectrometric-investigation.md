Our group constructed the desktop version of the SpectralWorkbench spectrometer: http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/spectrometer-construction

Our goal was to spectroscopically determine how the transmittance of coffee at a particular wavelength related to its concentration. Through this investigation, we also hoped to determine whether the make-your-own spectrometer can be used effectively for quantitative measurements - meaning that it can accurately determine concentration of the analyte. 

The concentration was measured informally in terms of scoops of coffee per cup of water used. We recorded the transmittance at 500 nm because it gave an easily distinguishable peak that noticeably changed in intensity as we varied concentration.

Beer's law predicts a linear relationship between a substance's absorbance of a particular wavelength and its concentration, meaning that a solution will absorb more light at higher concentrations. Our data exhibits a somewhat linear relationship, as seen on the plot below of absorbance versus concentration. The R^2 value of the linear regression of 0.9501 indicates that our sample follows Beer's Law to a fair degree.  

While taking each spectrum, we noticed that the intensity varied slightly over time. Therefore, noise resulting from the device may have produced the uncertainty in transmittance. Errors might also have occurred when preparing the samples.

Overall, however, the spectrometer is certainly capable of sensing changes in absorbance with concentration, but was not sufficiently accurate in doing so. It can be used to qualitatively distinguish between different concentrations, but further tests are needed to see whether it can be used quantitatively. 

We welcome all questions, comments, and advice!
