There’s been lots of interest in monitoring blasting at a mine site, monitoring a sand mining operation, and detecting runoff events in streams and rivers. We want to explore and test ways to use timelapse or “game cameras” using the technique described here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/photo-monitoring

I'm wondering -- 
 - Are there limits to using trail cameras on State Park land? 
 - Can we use a timelapse or video camera to monitor particulate air plumes?
