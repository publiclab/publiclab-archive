Hello! I have uploaded a template version of the book design for the DIY Oil Testing Toolkit. It's a basic Indesign template. You can print it using a self-publishing service like Blurb or take it to a printer and get it spiral bound! 

The template is for people and organizers who want to collaborate with others and help spread open-source tools for environmental exploration and investigation. The graphic elements in this work are release by the Public Lab and licensed under a
Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License.

The template was created by SuperCommunity (super-community.org) for the Public Lab. We’d love to hear how you are using the template and helping others with your work. Please email us hello@super-community.org or info@mlamadrid.com
