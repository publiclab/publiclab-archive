On November 19th Public Lab Community fellows @charlotte_clarke & @rollinrenola hosted the '' Use Your Sensors'' an event at Global Green Nola. In attendance were Science Students and professors from Dillard University, Delgado Community College and Nunez Community College of New Orleans.

The fellows were able to give students some in-site on building simple sensor prototypes and how they can be used for basic DYI data logging. These students were able to test how Arduino and DF Robot Turbidity Sensors can be used in oil & gas water monitoring. The students were also able to get an hands on experience by testing water samples from the Mississippi River and tap water that is used by surrounding communities.
