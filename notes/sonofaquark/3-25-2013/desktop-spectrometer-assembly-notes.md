I just finished assembling my desktop unit and posting my first spectra, and couldn't really find the right place for a collection of suggestions from users to share their assembly experience and suggest possible improvements within the current design parameters. If I missed it I would have no problem with transferring this note there.

I will start with my experience and suggestions, and invite others to comment and share theirs.

I recommend everyone remove the IR filter from the camera. It is really not necessary to measure visible light, but you are limiting the capability of the spectrometer for no good reason if you leave it in.

Removing the filter is really pretty simple. You remove the two screws that attach the lens assembly to the PC board, then carefully pop the assembly off the array. The circular glass IR filter is now exposed. If you take a pin and stick it into the soft plastic at the edge of the filter you can pop the filter out and then reassemble the lens assembly to the pcb.

I used the same pin to gently peel away the red glue that jams the focusing threads. The stated optimum focus distance is 9 inches. I screwed the lens all the way in, made a mark on the collar, then turned it out until the focus was optimum at that distance. It turned out to be almost exactly one turn. If others can verify that this or another value is good, it might be more repeatable than the more subjective focusing method.

The paper used for the kit is an excellent choice. It is very black. I think the surface gloss can still be reduced. I played around a bit with a couple of the scraps and came up with a technique: lightly scratch diagonally across the paper in alternating orthogonal directions with a (not too)sharp object using successively lighter pressure. Using this technique I was able to demonstrably reduce the reflectance of the paper. If I held it in the shadow of my workbench and flipped it from one side to the other I could easily discern the difference.

I also felt the shiny front of the camera and the light reflected from the grating might as well be blocked, since one of the scraps happened to be about the right size anyway. I cut a hole in it for the camera, and stuck it to the front of the camera/grating.

I don't really know if the stray light reduction measures will make any difference at all, but they cost nothing and are pretty simple, so I employed them in my unit. As I make a few more measurements we will have to see if any difference can be observed.
