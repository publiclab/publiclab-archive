High purity Argon has previously been difficult to obtain in small quantities and required expensive tanks. Mercury is everywhere.

The Argon is now available in small cartridges for preserving wine. It is relatively high purity. The welding argon typically contains some oxygen to aid in striking an arc. I bought a package of the cartridges on ebay, along with a "whippet cracker" used by recreational users of nitrous oxide to deprive the brain of oxygen by tying up the hemoglobin and depriving it of its ability to carry oxygen to the brain. It is used for whipping cream because it is soluble in fat.

The cartridges are a bit too large for the cracker. The dispenser sold by Preservino is more expensive than I am willing to go for right now. I will try and see if I can figure out a safe way to modify the cracker to dispense the gas. It is very dangerous. There is the possibility of frostbite or the cartridge flying off and causing injury or damage.

I believe if I just put a little mercury in a soft glass tube that has one end sealed, flush it with argon, heat up the tube and seal the other end, that the heat will result in a low enough pressure that I can excite the lamp with a walkie talkie or small tesla coil.

Any ideas or comments?
