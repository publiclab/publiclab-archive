somebody tried to tell me it's impossible to detect pesticide residue optically. When I went to work in a dingy lead lined basement at UCSF 35 years ago we had a small resistive magnet, a teletype, a 6802, and a tek storage scope. They told us the idea of imaging with NMR was ridiculous.

Then they decided they didn't like the nuclear word and changed the name to MRI.

About the same time a paper came around proposing that we had to find a better way to keep infants from dying in their cribs from lack of oxygen. It was too difficult to constantly draw arterial blood for blood gas testing. Now we put a plastic clip on a finger and an LED measures the color of the blood. 

We can do this. Not if, just when.
