###Oil Testing Kit from a sheet of A4 Paper? (kind of...)

Sometime ago, [@warren](http://publiclab.org/profile/warren) and [@mathew](http://publiclab.org/profile/mathew) were trying to make a container for the Oil Testing kit, from nothing but a piece of A4 paper.

This is what they came up with: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-05-2014/oil-testing-spectrometry-workshop-at-fab-10

Since that time, I have been trying to develop a more efficient version. This is what I came up with so far.

It has a few minor issues/bugs, so I was hoping people here wouldn't mind giving their two cents on what can be done to make improvements.

###The Lil' Box Itself.

This is what it looks like so far:

(Ignore the hole in the top. That shouldn't be there)

###How it works.

This image shows how the Box works; superimposed over the Public Labs Spectrometer.

###What You Will Need.

-A Standard Sheet of 80GSM, A4 Paper. (I didn't have any black A4 paper so used what I had to absorb extra light in my current model)

-An Old Toilet Roll Tube.

-An Oil Testing Kit.

-Shiny/Reflective Foil.

-Tape/Glue/Paperclips.

###Step1: Folding.

Fold your sheet of A4 paper so that you have a grid of existing guidelines to use when the box is folded together.

##Step2: Cutting.

Cleanly cut along the red lines (make sure your don't cut through the bit that attaches the lid to the rest of the box).

Punch holes through the dots at the center of the blue lines.

You should end up with something like this:

###Step3: Sticking:

Stick shiny foil over the grey squares. The small flap should have shiny foil on both sides.

Also, stick the diffraction grating over the hole that is where the green dot is.

###Step4: Assembling.

See the images here for information on assembling the box:

###Spectral Workbench Test Images:

These are images that I have taken so far during the development process.

The latest of which uses my current model, which uses the curve of a toiler roll tube to deflect light towards the camera.
