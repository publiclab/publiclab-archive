##How it works

The electrical current passes through a piece of ceramic material that then heats up a metal pipe. Glue sticks are then melted as the they are pushed down the pipe and out of the nozzle.

##Why I am interested

Glue sticks for glue guns are really expensive so I was thinking of setting up a metal tin, heating it with plastic inside  & then having it extrude that melted plastic out of a small length of metal pipe.

I am hopefully that eventually this method could be used to turn recycled plastic into filament for 3D printers.
