###What I want to do

Try to detect specific elements/molecules using acrylic paint to filter waves of light down a piece of optic fibre & into a light sensor. 

###Questions and next steps

Why Acrylic Paint? Because it is Translucent - so will hopefully only let light that is the wavelength targeted enter the optic fibre & be detected by the light sensor.

What next? Updating this page with a better explanation of the science involved & then performing experiments to see if it works!
