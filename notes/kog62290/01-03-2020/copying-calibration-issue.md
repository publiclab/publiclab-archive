I have a calibration data set that works fine but I cannot copy this calibration to a second set of data to calibrate it. In both cases I uploaded the photo as the live[-](https://woq9.com/ "https://woq9.com/")imaging does not work for me either. I am using an iPhone with the paper spectrophotometer to capture the images and then I am uploading via a desktop computer.
