I was about to remove a webcam which was home but seeing the pout with which my wife looked at me , I thought to make a printable box where you could put on and remove the webcam . The lid where the webcam is subject carries a bag for a Velcro straps .
Here you have the design and stl for those who want to print and test files.

Thanks to Jeffrey encouraged me to publish here . regards
