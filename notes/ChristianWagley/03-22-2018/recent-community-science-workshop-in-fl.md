The Public Lab workshop on aerial mapping held on Indian Bayou in FL was a great success! Stevie of Public Lab did a great job leading us onsite and in the classroom. We used Indian Bayou--a water body facing sedimentation issues from nearby road construction--as our focus. And we only had one kite go down, but all was recovered :-). We had folks from two local universities and several nonprofits in attendance, and a variety of research needs were discussed that will be able to utilize these methods.
