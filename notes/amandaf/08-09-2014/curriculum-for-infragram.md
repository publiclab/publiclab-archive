###What we want to do
Create four lesson plans for middle and high school teachers to introduce IR photography, Infragram Sandbox, and environmental monitoring.  Please check out [lesson 1 and 2 in the wiki](/wiki/infragram-curriculum)

###Our Plan
[Lesson 1: Plants, geography of Louisiana, and need for wetlands monitoring and IR photography](/wiki/infragram-curriculum) (link to the wiki)

* plant seeds to use in lesson 3 or 4
* possible hands-on activity about storm surges or oil spills/extraction
* possible watershed activity- create model watershed from paper, spray with water 
* focus on photosynthesis

[Lesson 2: More than meets the eye (the electromagnetic spectrum and how we see light)](/wiki/infragram-curriculum) (link to the wiki)

* possibly make spectrometer
* use colored filter and enclosed box to view items of different colors and learn about how we perceive color
* mixing pigments vs mixing lights: use colored filters and flashlights (or glow sticks) to mix light and discover how it creates different colors
* discuss components of eyes, then view optical illusion (false-colored flag that leaves a negative afterimage of the typical red, white, and blue)

Lesson 3: Basics of Photography

* use cheap webcam and/or camera phone with remote control to see IR (cameras that don't have IR filter)
* Remove IR filter from digital cameras alter white balance
* photograph stressed and unstressed plants (from lesson 1) and view in pseudocolor/false color

Lesson 4: Bringing it all together

* most of class will be devoted to a larger project using modded cameras (specifics to be determined)


###Questions and next steps

####What should the final project in Lesson 4 be?
