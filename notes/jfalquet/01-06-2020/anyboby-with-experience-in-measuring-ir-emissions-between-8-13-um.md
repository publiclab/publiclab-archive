I'm interested in measuring radiative cooling from plant surfaces in the "atmospheric window" region (8-13 microns). My very basic question is : how does a desert plant cools itself, as it obviously cannot use "normal" transpiration to do it. I'd like to know whether biological evolution already discovered something like ultraradiative metamaterials similar to what has been recently published here: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6329/1062/tab-figures-data
