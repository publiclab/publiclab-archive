I want to make a tablet computer microscope. This is adapted from 
"Make Magazine, Microscope"
- http://makezine.com/projects/smartphone-microscope/
- https://youtu.be/sqQI_3vCl7U
and
"Instructables: $10 Smartphone to Digital Microscope Conversion!" - All - https://goo.gl/KxO4lh

I have built a platform and it's working well.

I want to achieve better magnification. I right now have 40x magnification, using two laser pointer lenses. Some builds claim to achieve 
magnification levels as high as 175x or even 375x with the addition of a second lens. https://goo.gl/KxO4lh

This is super cool. Also, I'm sure this could be useful to citizen scientists and schools. 

Much of the work for this prototype was done at the Artisan's Asylum in Somerville, MA http://artisansasylum.com/.
