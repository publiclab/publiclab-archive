I worked on solving an issue for Publiclab by separating the appearance of power tags from normal tags. A detailed explanation of what power tags are can be found [here][1].   

- Required resources: Publiclab Github repository, code editor

- Steps I took to solve the issue

1. Deploy the Publiclab website on Cloud9 by following the instructions [here.][2]  
2. Locate the \_tagging.html.erb file in the Github repository.
3. Edit the file to separate power tags from normal tags (Check if the tag contains a colon. If it does, display it as a power tag by using a different color class, and if it doesn't display it as a normal tag.)
