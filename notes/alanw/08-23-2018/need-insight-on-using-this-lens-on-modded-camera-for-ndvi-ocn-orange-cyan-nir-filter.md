Bought rebuild Inspire 1 quad copter and bought modded camera for NDVI.  The information that came with it says :   

==========  

new OCN (Orange+Cyan+NIR) filter.

  
The first thing to notice is that all 3 of the bands are different,  
even the near-infrared (NIR). Instead of red light it captures orange,  
instead of green it captures cyan (blue-green) and instead of 850nm  
NIR, it captures 808nm NIR. The bandwidths are also slightly wider to  
provide more contrast.

============  

QUESTION:  In FIJI, which bands do I use for NDVI calculation?  Is the 808NIR band the BLUE band in RGB?

  
Thanks,
