I want to know the spectrum of the public lighting used in certain area. They are supposed to use high pressure sodium lamps, but the only way to be sure is to analize the spectrum of such bulbs. Does the lego spectrometer could be used to obtain the spectrum profile? if so, at what distance do you think that I could get usable readigns with this spectrometer given that I'm not able to get closer readings (i.e. If the lights are hanging at 10 m above surface level).

  
I'm an oceanographer and I use to protect (or try to) the environment from all kinds of pollution. In this case I want to be sure of the type of bulbs because they were installed on the coastline, where turtles arrive every year for nesting, and hatchlings can be affected by excesive sky glow if proper lighting is not used. LED's then to have high blue peaks beyond 4000K, therefore much Rayleigh dispersion is expected from those sources, hence more sky pollution.    

  
I know there are scientist equipment like the Jaz spectrometer from Ocean optics, but I don't have the budget to spend $8,000 on such a device. Thanks in advance for all your work. Best Regards.
