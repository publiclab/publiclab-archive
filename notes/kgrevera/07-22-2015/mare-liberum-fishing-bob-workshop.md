##Mare Liberum Fishing Bob Workshop

###Background
We are looking to have a thermal fishing bob workshop with the organization [Mare Liberum](http://www.thefreeseas.org). Mare Librium is a freeform publishing, boatbuilding and waterfront art collective and civic initiative based out of Brooklyn, New York. They do their work on the Gowanus Canal, seeking to make visible the "overlooked and neglected", in particular the degradation of the aquatic environment.

###Goals
* Brainstorm ways to make thermal pollution visible to the public.
* Help build [fishing bobs](http://www.publiclab.org/wiki/thermal-camera) and [towable rigs](http://www.publiclab.org/notes/kgrevera/07-06-2015/cape-cod-thermal-fishing-bob-field-test).

###Agenda
TBA

###Where?
Boston, MA
Exact location will be announced closer to the date.

###When?
The week of September 12th.

###What do to if you are interested?
