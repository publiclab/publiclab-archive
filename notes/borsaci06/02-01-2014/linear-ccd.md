I already constructed a spectometer and testing it... I want to know whether a Linear CCD can be used like webcam... For the ones who are interested, a Linear CCD is a CCD that captures a single line of pixels at a time... These can be scavenged from old scanners...

Lately I disassembled my old Compeye Simplex flatbed scanner which I didnot use anymore for recycling parts for my 3d printer project and I saw the Linear CCD on the board... I thought it will be a good idea to use it as a spectrometer cam... No need for IR filter removal (it doesn't have one), no need for a lens  and it captureas a single line...

The problem is to interface it with PC or a microprocessor like Arduino... I couldn't find any help on the web about this particular CCD so I decided to share with you here... 
Any help will be appreciated... Any ideas?...
