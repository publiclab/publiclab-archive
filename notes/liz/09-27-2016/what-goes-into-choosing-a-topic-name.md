_above: sketch of figuring out how to organize "air" into a research area, and which methods are part of the research area, and which activities would go on what grid...Photo by @nshapiro_

We've been having some fun discussions over the past couple months with people on each of the topical lists about what to name the new "top-level" pages where we're organizing. That means -- when posting activities, do they end up on /wiki/balloon-mapping or /wiki/aerial-photography? Do we use the older /wiki/spectrometer page, or the new one at /wiki/spectrometry? But we're hoping for even MOAR discussion! 

**Let's think about:** 

1. where and how these new pages will show up -- most likely on a dropdown menu and maybe eventually on the front page of publiclab.org,
2. and, the timing -- we're prioritizing the creation of these "origin" pages amidst all the creation of activities and activity grids we've been working on and will continue to work on through Barnraising. 

**So far we've created drafts of:**

* http://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry
* https://publiclab.org/wiki/coqui (created over LEAFFEST weekend; this will, in turn, be linked into a top-level water page once we figure out what to name it)
* https://publiclab.org/wiki/aerial-photography (first draft created September 23)
* https://publiclab.org/wiki/open-air (created Sept 27 by Nick, Leslie, Liz, and only lists the plant-based air filter kit so far)

**Up next:** 
    
* https://publiclab.org/wiki/multispectral-imaging with @cfastie for all our infrared photography work (actually, it's drafted but needs to be automated.) (Also, that's a really long, and to some, an unrecognizable name.) 
* https://publiclab.org/wiki/pole-mapping (possibly, with @ekta64?)
* https://publiclab.org/wiki/open-water (which in turn will link to Riffle)

**When naming new pages, some things to consider are that names should be:**

* short and usable for tagging or telling someone about
* engaging to existing contributors and long-standing members of our community
* not jargony in a way that it blocks new people from accessing the topic -- think accessibility, but also think about how we can make our topics problem-based, rather than theory-based
* in alignment with terms people are searching for on the internet at large: 
https://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=aerial%20photography,aerial%20mapping,drone%20photography
https://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=infrared%20photography,multispectral%20imagery,ndvi

**Looking ahead, we have more naming to do! There are some mismatched names:** 

* "dssk" vs. "desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0"
* "infragram" vs. "infrared" vs "multispectral-imaging"
* "timelapse" vs. the broader" photo-monitoring" 

**We'd really like to hear from a wide selection of voices about naming! Please pile on in the comments! Thank you!**
