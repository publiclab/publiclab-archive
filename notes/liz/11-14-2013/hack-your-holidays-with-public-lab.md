##Just imagine: 

* Walking through a winter-wonderland with winged widgets
Capturing aerial photos of your family's snow angels and snow forts
* Documenting spectra of chestnuts roasting over an open fire
Searching for Rudolf the Infrared-Nosed Reindeer
* Hosting a spirited spectral showdown to explore your favorite liquors
* Basking in the spectral richness of holiday candles, colored LED lights, and incandescent bulbs

Public Lab open hardware kits are lovingly created by a community of contributors. These kits embody the spirit of giving, making them the perfect way to open source your holiday. Do you know someone special who'd love a balloon mapping kit or a spectrometer for their beloved smartphone? Public Lab kits make wonderful gifts for your friends and family--explore DIY science together around the kitchen table and outside!
