Dear Public Lab NYC, 
I hope this holiday season is finding you well! 
Join us for a late afternoon holiday get-together in Brooklyn on Saturday, December 15th at 4pm. Come introduce yourself, meet other Public Lab NYCers, check out our workspace (which you can use by appointment) recap the highlights of 2012, and join the brainstorming for the upcoming year. We'll have snacks and spectrometers, a floating shark, music, stickers, and post-industrial ambiance in spades. Please bring something to share, even if it's simply your good humor, and especially if it's research equipment you have made!

Location: 
Public Lab NYC 
Lab room 815, 8th floor
630 Flushing Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11206

Transit Directions:
JMZ or G to Flushing Avenue Station (only 4 stops from Manhattan's Chinatown on J)

It's a huge building, so here's some extra directions:
From Flushing Ave, go along the side of the building on Harrison/Thompkins. Turn into the parking lot, and walk in the entrance on the back of the building. Once inside, ask the lobby attendant for directions up to Public Laboratory. 
See you there!
