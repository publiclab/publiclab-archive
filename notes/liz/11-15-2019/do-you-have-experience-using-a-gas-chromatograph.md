# Do you have experience using a gas chromatograph?

Has anyone has experience with using a gas chromatograph? If so, we'd love to hear about it! 

Gas chromatographs came up during this month's OpenHour (November 2019).  Chris Nidel (also a guest on [June 2016 OpenHour "Concepts of Proof"][1]) shared the following story about his experience as an environmental lawyer investigating side-by-side with a community affected by a creosote plant (the notes below are my transcript of his verbal presentation with some paraphrasing): 

>In Oregon, while standing near a park near a creosote plant during the day, you can't smell anything and everything looks fine. Later in the day you'd come back and the park would smell horrific, naphthalene everywhere, etc.  

> GC is the abbreviation for "gas chromatograph" which can be used to detect a wide variety of possible contaminants. We could put a "GC" in the living-room of an effected community member, run the hose outside, and get near-real-time samples that show that when the sun goes down and the night-shift comes in they open up the "fart valve" and poison the community. 

>We used a model of gas chromatograph called the FROG 5000, here's the link: http://www.defiant-tech.com/frog-5000-portable-gas-chromatograph.php . We rented it from a 3rd party distributor for a cost of $500-$1000 for 2-3 days up to a week, but we are also in conversation with manufacturer.  

>The closer we can get to "rigorous lab data" the more powerful advocacy is.  If a community can get donations, use a non-profit, etc, fancy tools are a very powerful way to go from community experience (headaches, smells, nosebleeds) to data that a regulator can't ignore.
