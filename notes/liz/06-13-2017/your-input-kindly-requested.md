Dear everyone,

We know your time is highly valuable, and so we don't ask this lightly: when you get a moment, please take 10 minutes (and a deep breath) and fill out this once-a-year member survey.

Here's the link: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9jkCUOZ1gBVdq7nBY-aYaqVyc7YNFhiQQmYypys4NKQqm5w/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9jkCUOZ1gBVdq7nBY-aYaqVyc7YNFhiQQmYypys4NKQqm5w/viewform)

Thanks to our partners at UCDavis for all their support on this!
