We had a great time at World Maker Faire!

Big thanks to the many awesome Public Labbers who took time to represent to the masses: **Katie Gradowski, Zach Hirschritt, Sara Farmer, Eymund Diegel, Gena Wirth, Jen Hudon, Stefan "Dogi" Unterhauser, Jeremy, Alex Hoekstra, Will Ward, Don Blair and many more who visited during the day. **

It was a great opportunity to meet far flung folks from the community and connect with new members. 

**We won an Educator's Choice Award, and two (2) Editor's Choice Awards** (modeled by Don Blair, above). 

Our panel was livestreamed, check out the link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMYYRwh8ssc
