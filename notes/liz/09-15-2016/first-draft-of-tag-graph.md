# First draft of tag graph

@bsugar used Gephi to make this tag graph of the top 256 tags used on PublicLab.org.

* If there are 10 or more co-occurrences of pairs of tags, they get a line drawn between them; the thicker the line, the more co-occurrences. 
* Different colors indicate closely associated tags, referred to as "communities". There are ~15 "communities" shown here. Benjamin tested a range of numbers, this was the best fit as a first draft.
