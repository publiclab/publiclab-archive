# Anyone still using the legacy editors? Speak up now!

Hi everyone, 

With all the great attention going into the Editor project on PublicLab.org, we are anticipating that we may be able to turn off links to our "legacy editors" by the end of the summer --- but first we wanted to check in to see if anyone on here was still using them. Here's how to check...the links to "legacy editors" appear in two places: 

  
\* at the top of the Questions editor ([https://publiclab.org/questions/new](https://publiclab.org/questions/new?legacy=true "https://publiclab.org/questions/new?legacy=true")), if you click the link in the green box, you will be redirected to the legacy Questions editor: [https://publiclab.org/questions/new?legacy=true](https://publiclab.org/questions/new?legacy=true "https://publiclab.org/questions/new?legacy=true").

\* at the top of the Research Note Editor ([https://publiclab.org/post](https://publiclab.org/post)), if you click on the italicized link, you will be redirected to the legacy Notes editor: [https://publiclab.org/post?&legacy=true](https://publiclab.org/post?&legacy=true "https://publiclab.org/post?&legacy=true").
