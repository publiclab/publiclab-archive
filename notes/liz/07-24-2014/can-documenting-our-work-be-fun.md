**My question is "can wiki gardening be social or fun in any way?"**

###background

Having experimented with wiki gardening as part of a group of people working together on a conference call (http://publiclab.org/wiki/common-water-contaminants), I have been wondering about how to host an event dedicated to collaborative documentation. <br>
For example, this is a really nice looking page by [Jeff](/profile/warren): http://publiclab.org/wiki/oil-testing-kit, that was created as a solo activity. Is this the only way good documentation can effectively happen, or can groups work on pages together, either at the same time or serially? 

###some good ideas

* using the talk page to collaboratively edit with a group, and then one person pasting that into the wiki page. Etherpad also has a chat feature, but no image layout capability. 
* sending a google doc out in markdown for future posting as a wiki page. Google Doc have the additional benefit of in-line commenting. In this way, the margins of the document become informal spaces for discussion. 
* an idea for two-part facilitation from [Mathew](/profile/mathew), a single wiki writer sharing a screen in videoconference, while other people collaboratively work in the pad-- dedicated wiki writer and pad facilitator. (similar to our builidng code writing process-- mathew)
