##Hand-held photos taken at 100 Quincy Garden, Brooklyn

##My attempt and results

Getting some Infragrams of 100 Quincy, it seems clear that wood chips reflect some near-infrared wavelengths.

##Questions and next steps

Wy would the kale -- which appears brighter in the raw infragram and also in nIR NOT be the most intense NDVI value in this photograph?
