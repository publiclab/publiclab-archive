**What are recommended privacy protection guidelines for minors engaging in Public Lab online?**

As we prepare to welcome more youth into the Public Lab online community, we are reviewing what we have in the Code of Conduct regarding minors such as the [Media policy][1] that states "Never post the names of minors in conjunction with their photo." 

We are also reviewing how @pdhixenbaugh approaches working with youth at camp: 
https://publiclab.org/notes/pdhixenbaugh/08-22-2018/diy-science-lesson-with-the-coqui "Photos of hands are OK, photos of people are not"

We are also considering the following guidelines: 

* do not use your real name
* do not share your gender
* do not share personal photos
* do not share your location

What do you think?
