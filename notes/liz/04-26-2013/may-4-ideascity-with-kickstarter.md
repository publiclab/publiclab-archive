##Event details

* http://www.newmuseum.org/ideascity/view/kickstarter-and-the-creative-city
* http://www.kickstarter.com/pages/ideas-city

**Arrive at the Kickstarter booth on the Bowery just north of Rivington at 9/9:30AM on May 4th. **

To start the day at 10AM, Oscar and crew will lead the crowd in assembling a rig like he did during May Day, 2012. With the crowd assembled rig, we will do 4 or 5 festival mapping excursions from 11:15-5PM (ending at 5PM). After each run, images will be brought back to the tent, and uploaded for stitching. All day in the tent we will be demonstrating how to stitch images together into maps using mapknitter.org. We will have two monitors -- one where people can browse the images, and the other set up as a stitching station. The back of our booth (6' wide) will be covered with Grassroots Mapping Forums and other cool maps and sketches. The large Public Lab blimp will be floating above the booth all day creating a timelapse video.
