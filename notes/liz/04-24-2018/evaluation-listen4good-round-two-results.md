### Background

In 2015 we began creating an evaluation framework for understanding more about Public Lab's constituency and how we, as a non-profit, can better serve them. See https://publiclab.org/notes/Shannon/03-01-2016/creating-an-evaluation-framework-for-public-lab. Thanks to support from the Fund for Shared Insight's Listen4Good program and the Rita Allen Foundation, we have been able to do in-depth work collecting and analyzing data about one particular group of constituents: those who attend Public Lab in-person events. The idea was that the feedback from post-event surveys would help us understand who is coming to the events, why, what people's experiences are, what we could do better, and how people intend to use what they learned after the event. The feedback from these surveys will help us to shape our events and outreach.

Round One for the Public Lab Listen4Good project included 77 respondents who attended Public Lab events between July and December 20th, 2016. These respondents participated in events that ranged from the Regional Barnraising and Annual Barnraising, to local workshops such as mapping and spectrometer builds. The Round One report can be found here: https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/02-09-2017/evaluation-listen4good-round-one-results

### Round Two

**Data:** Round two included 80 respondents who attended in-person events between April - November 2017: 78 from in-person events including the West Virginia Barnraising, the Annual Gulf Coast Barnraising, stormwater workshops in New Orleans, and air monitoring in Wisconsin; an additional 2 were submitted by online attendees of OpenHour, our monthly topical webinar. 

**Methods:**  The Listen4Good program includes six core questions, one of which is based on a framework called the "Net Promoter System" (NPS) which has long been used in customer engagement circles. This framework asks the question, on a scale of 1-10: 1 being not at all likely, and 10 being extremely likely, "How likely is it that you would recommend Public Lab to a friend or family member?" From this question, a score can be determined that can help you compare how your organization, or company, is doing relative to others who provide similar services. People who select anything between a 1-6 are considered detractors, this adds to a negative overall score for the organization. Those who score a 7-8 are considered passive and don't add or take away score, those who score a 9-10 are considered promoters and add positive points to your overall score. The total score subtracts the percent of detractors from the percent of promoters. We then added five additional custom questions more directly related to our mission for a total of eleven questions on the survey. 

People responded to these questions through an online Survey Monkey link or on a printed paper survey which staff then entered into SurveyMonkey. Analysis was primarily done inside of SurveyMonkey’s platform which offers graphs and statistical analysis as well as benchmarks from across thousands of other organizations, as well as in Excel. 

### Results -- Highlights

* Respondents at in-person events were 50% People of Color in round two (2017), up from 21% People of Color in round one (2016), meaning that Public Lab greatly improved demographic representation from last year’s results.
* There was overwhelming feedback that the Public Lab community is a respectful community, as seen in the responses to the question: “how often do members of the Public Lab community treat you with respect?” 99% of responses were “always” (86%) and “mostly” (13%). One person choose “sometimes.” 
* Among those who said their reason for attending was “to join an organizing effort or campaign about this place, their NPS was a full +100. 
* Among those who said their reason for attending was for a “school trip,” meaning they didn’t actually choose to be there, their NPS was a -50. 

### Results -- data and analysis 

Based on the demographic categories offered by the survey instrument, here is a table of how people who attended in-person events and responded to the survey chose to self-identify their race and ethnicity:

| Response | Percentage % | # Respondents |
|------|------|------|
| White | 50% | 37 |
| Black or African American | 32.43% | 24 |
| Hispanic or Latino | 2.7% | 2 |
| Asian | 6.76% | 5 |
| American Indian or Alaska Native | 1.35% | 1 |
| Multiracial or multiethnic | 2.7% | 2 |
| Some other race or ethnicity (please specify) | 2.7% | 2 |
| -- | # of respondents to this question (out of 80) | 74 |

**Respondents at in-person events self-identified as 50% People of Color in round two (2017), up from 21% People of Color in round one (2016), meaning that Public Lab is getting closer to a representative distribution.**

#### Mission

We asked about two statements specific to our mission:

* Participating in Public Lab helps me become more engaged in environmental science/monitoring.
* Participating in Public Lab events provides me with tools that help me take action on my own environmental interests and concerns.

**...which elicited high levels of agreement across the entire cohort:** 
![image description][1]

* 89% somewhat or strongly agree that “Participating in Public Lab helps me become more engaged in environmental science/monitoring”
* 87% somewhat or strongly agree that “Participating in Public Lab events provides me with tools that help me take action on my own environmental interests and concerns”
* Tuning into demographics, none of the “Strongly disagree” / “Somewhat disagree” choices were from People of Color; one Person of Color chose “Neither disagree nor agree” 

#### Respectful community

**There was overwhelming feedback across the entire cohort that the Public Lab community is a respectful community, as seen in the responses to the question: “how often do members of the Public Lab community treat you with respect?”**

![image description][2]

**99% of respondents selected “always” (86%) or “mostly” (13%). One person choose “sometimes.”**

#### Net Promoters Score

**Net Promoters Score:**  As we understand it, the Listen4Good model is designed for service organizations that “directly meet people’s needs.” Public Lab is the inverse of a direct service agency in that we are a peer-to-peer community in which the staff and active members facilitate among people by bridging between domains of experience / expertise in order to address complex, real world issues. 

For newcomers, those who have “never engaged before today” or have “engaged once or twice before, our NPS score is +43, or “good,” the same as it was in Round One.

Respondents were 52% female, and 48% male. Across all ages:

* average female NPS is **+65** (positive, and above the benchmark of 63) 
* average male NPS is **+48** (positive, but below the benchmark of 63) 

Our total NPS for Round 2 was +37 based on 42 promoters, 24 passives, 13 detractors, at a time when the benchmark NPS was +63. This is significantly lower than our very high score in Round One of +82, based on 64 promoters, 10 passives and 2 detractors, at a time when the benchmark was +50. 

**Looking more closely, the sharpest divide in NPS is associated with the reason someone attended the event:** 

* Among those who said their reason for attending was “to join an organizing effort or campaign about this place, their **NPS was a full +100.** 
* Among those who said their reason for attending was for a “school trip,”, their **NPS was a -50.** 

This shows that motivation is critical to how an event is experienced. We can only speculate if young people on a school trip -- who expressed lots of enthusiasm in person as noted by staff present on field trips -- might have seen a “6” on a scale of 1-10 as not quite that negative since its “above the midpoint” or “above average;” however NPS considers a 6 on a scale of 1-10 to be a “detractor.” 

#### What best describes your reasons for coming to this event?

| I want to collaborate with Public Lab / I am a partner / collaborator / I am from a co-hosting collaborating organization: NPS +50 | 6 |
