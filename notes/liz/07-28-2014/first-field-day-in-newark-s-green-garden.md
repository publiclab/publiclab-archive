On Sunday, July 27, [Phil](/profile/p_silva_82) and I went to Newark, NJ, picked up Cynthia Mellon, and went to Green Garden to meet Carla Green, Frank, and Elizabeth Reynoso. 
<br>
We worked on basic garden tracking tools in the [Five Borough Farm toolkit](http://publiclab.org/wiki/5bf), and then Frank and Carla rigged the new 50' carbon fiber pole to take pictures. First we put up the infragram, and then the visible camera. The map is underway here: https://mapknitter.org/maps/2014-07-27-new-jersey-newark-green-garden-visible
