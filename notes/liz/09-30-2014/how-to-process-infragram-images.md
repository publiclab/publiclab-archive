###What I want to do

Process this raw infragram, taken by a hand-converted infrablue camera (originally beinging to [Jeff Warren](/profile/warren):

This image was taken by community gardeners who have set up an experiment with a fall planting of collards. They want to see whether mulching makes a difference in plant health. To that end, we designed an experiment with a single raised bed split into halves: half mulched, half unmulched. 

###My attempt and results

When i upload to infragram.org, the aspect ration is distorted, probably because the system is not expecting a cropped photo:

Next i choose a preset for **NDVI blue filters -- colorized**:

However, the result seems rather undifferentiated:

###Questions and next steps

How can i make the processed image more revealing?
