The telescoping fishing road worked great to raise the Infragram over the raised beds spread around the edges of the DOE Fund headquarters. The rod+ camera combo is quite portable, and fast to put back up once moving to a new location. It also attracts lots of attention from fishing fans!

##My attempt and results
I chose six (6) images from the main garden area to stitch together, saved out a JPG that was less than 5MB, and uploaded it to 
The NDVI range was good on the resulting image: http://infrapix.pvos.org/show/DOE-Fund-stitch1_small.jpg

I added some white space to the side with the intention of leaving some room for the legen, and reuploaded it to infrapix, but the NDVI scale changed for the worse: http://infrapix.pvos.org/show/DOE-Fund-stitch1_small1.jpg

##Questions and next steps

Still getting the hang of Infrapix, but excited!
