# Infragrams over NYC: Leave It Better Garden

##Pole aerial photography above the Leave It Better Garden

The Leave It Better Garden is located at 1970 Grand Avenue Bronx. 

##My attempt and results

Using the visible camera, we captured about half of the garden, and just missed the opportunity to photograph a dozen children learning about butterfly host plants. I stitched three of the photos into the leading image. 

The Infragram photos of this garden came out over-exposed, and in the image below only the shadowed edges of the planter boxes can be discerned.

##Questions and next steps

I am wondering how to avoid this overexposure in the future.
