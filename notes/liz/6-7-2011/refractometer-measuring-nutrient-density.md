A refractometer measures how much light bends as it passes through a liquid. 
<strong>n = velocity of light in a vacuum / velocity of light in medium</strong>

Can a refractometer be used to check nutrient density in plant sap? 

From the <a href="http://realfoodcampaign.org/content/brix">Real Food Campaign Website</a>:
Pure water at a specific temperature will bend light at a specific angle. A wide variety of biological substances can increase solution density, and thus cause light to refract (bend) more as it passes through a watery medium: 
1. dissolved minerals (salts, acids, alkali) 
2. carbohydrates (simple sugars) 
3. amino acids (proteins) 
4. lipids (special case: oil & water don't mix; form thin films) 
5. almost any molecule with covalent bonding 
6. very large suspended particles (colloids)

BRIX measures the percent solids (TSS) in a given weight of plant juice‚ nothing more‚ nothing less.
BRIX is often expressed as the percentage of sucrose. However, the "sucrose" can vary widely.
BRIX is actually a sum of the pounds of sucrose, fructose, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, proteins, hormones, and other solids in one hundred pounds of plant juice.
