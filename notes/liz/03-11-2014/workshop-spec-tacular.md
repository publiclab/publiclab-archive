###Background

"Reading Rainbows" is the coolest thing since balloon aerial mapping. We are beginning this workshop with constructing our spectrometers so that everyone has one of their own. Then, we will learn how to use the website spectralworkbench.org to calibrate it using common fluorescent lights. Then we will but the spectrometers and our samples into a bigger, lightproof box so that we can shine lasers into them. 

First up is to get spectra of known substances to begin building our library of environmental chemicals. In the future we will be setting forth to identify unknown environmental chemicals. 

But don't take my word for it.
