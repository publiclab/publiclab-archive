###Gena's planning notes

I am planning to go and bring the kite- Don has also graciously said we could use a 2 person kayak, or two single person kayaks. 
 
Eymund, are you able to bring multiple kites and spools, or do I need to pick these up from someone? I am out of town until Sun morning but could coordinate a pickup then. 

 I have a junky camera we can use, but another one would be good. 

See some of you soon!
