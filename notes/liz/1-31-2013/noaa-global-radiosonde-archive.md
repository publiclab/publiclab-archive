</strong>
Interesting: "The Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA), a new radiosonde dataset from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). IGRA consists of radiosonde and pilot balloon observations at more than 1500 globally distributed stations with varying periods of record, many of which extend from the 1960s to present. Observations include 

* Pressure
* Temperature
* Geopotential Height
* Dewpoint Depression
* Wind Direction
* Wind Speed at standard, surface, tropopause, and significant levels."

The period of record varies from station to station, with many extending from 1970 to present (Figure 2). Station records are updated daily and are available online at no charge.

Kite Operations, apparently they flew kites on piano wire. (This also reminds me of <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/people/mathew">Mathew</a>)
