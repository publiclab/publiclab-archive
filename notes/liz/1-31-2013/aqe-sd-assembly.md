Assembly of the modified Air Quality Eggs with SD cards started up today in NYC. Joe Saavedra and Leif Percifield are working on the hardware and software for 15 units for Cypress Hills Community School PS 89. 12 units will be sent home with students, 1 unit will be used for teaching, 1 unit will be installed next to an EPA Air Monitoring Station, and 1 unit will be sent to our partners at MIT. The photo of the hydroponics and aquaponics was taken in the school's rooftop greenhouse.
