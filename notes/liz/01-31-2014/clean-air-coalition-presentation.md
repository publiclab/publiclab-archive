###Event details

Notes on **Erin Heaney of the Clean Air Coalition Western New York** presenting at NYU ITP, January 31, 2014:

The Clean Air Coalition of Western New York was founded by residents in Tonawanda, NY more than 10 years ago who suspected that their health problems and the neighborhood stink was linked to the industrial plants in their neighborhood.

Erin explains how Tonawanda residents used Global Community Monitor's "bucket" and windroses that helped identify the source of the pollution to Tonawanda Coke.

Citizen science showed companies were well exceeding benzine levels in their emissions, prompting NY DEC to do a year long monitoring study collecting samples every 6 minutes. 

* Benzine levels were found to be 75 times higher than permitted, as well as excessive levels of formaldehyde. 

* But just because there was data doesn't mean that government or industry takes any action. 

The community approached the company "Tonawanda Coke" to form a collaborative action plan, to no response. The community, who have never before been environmental activists, changed tactics and organized to bring government enforcement against Tonawanda Coke. 

##Result of community organizing efforts to bring government enforcement

EPA ordered raid of the factory by US Coast Guard, US Attorney General, EPA, and NY DEC. 

The environmental control manager was arrested and led out of the plant in handcuffs. He was trying to hide leaking valves from the inspectors. 

Department of Justice filed criminal charges against the plant. 

The case went to trial a year ago--an extremely rare outcome. A 5 week trial, after which the jury took less than one hour to determine guilty verdict for company and the environmental control manager. 

This is only the second successful criminal conviction under Title 5 of the Clean Air Act. 
See http://www.cacwny.org/docs/Title%20V%20-%20The%20proof%20is%20in%20the%20permit.PDF

Fines have been levelled, sentencing scheduled for March 2014, potential settlement money for the community. The community is interested in further citizen science initiatives!

###Background

from http://www.cacwny.org/campaigns/tonawanda/

Tonawanda: There are 53 industrial facilities in Tonawanda, the highest concentration of air regulated facilities in the state. Two major interstate highways intersect in the community and one holds a tollbooth where traffic congestion is a problem. Clean Air Coalition works every day to build community power to reduce environmental risks and better community health. 

##New initiatives happening in Buffalo's lower west side.

The nation's third largest land port. This community has one of three bridges that could be used for the expansion of the port, but this community has predominantly people of color and over 75% poverty rate, while the other two communities are predominantly white. 

Citizen science efforts in Buffalo's lower west side began by looking at VOCs, but shifted to particulate matter. 

##Lessons

When you organize around environmental issues that are affecting people in their neighborhood, change can happen.
