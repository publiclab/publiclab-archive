###Background

We had a great trip on the NY/NJ Baykeeper boat in June, and now it's time to make the map! Original event posting here: http://publiclab.org/notes/melissachecker/06-18-2014/kite-mapping-on-the-kill-van-kull

Our images largely look fisheye because we used a GoPro and were in the middle of the channel. We will need to process them to lay flat:

From the boat, we took a lot of pictures of the coastline:

**On top of the stitched map, we want to add these photos together with their elevation above sea level:** 

This is the former Manhattan Project site that is radioactive and sited in the floodzone:

This site used to be a kayak launch before hurricane sandy scoured the beach away:
