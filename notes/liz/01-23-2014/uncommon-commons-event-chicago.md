###Event details

**Wednesday, February 12, 2014, 10am-1pm**
Chicago Hilton's Media Lounge, Joliet Room 3rd floor


This year’s Media Lounge / ARTspace at CAA in Chicago will host “Uncommon Commons” – **an incubator of skills and knowledge sharing**, which responds to the thematic concerns of the commons and commoning, through a series of workshops, film and video screenings, public offerings, discussions and provocations by a range of international artists, film makers, activists, art critics, curators, community researchers, educators, ethnographers, and lawyers.

**Please join! I'll be hosting a conversation about this and it would be so much better if you were part of it: **

_Join the Public Lab in discussing the political dimensions of taking science into your own hands AND how “reimagining the human relationship to the environment” can yield surprising results. The goal of the Public Lab open source community is to bring environmental activists together with technologists and scientists to create affordable, easy-to-build toolkits. These toolkits are being used by communities around the world tackling issues like corporate polluters, illegal deforestation, toxic gas release from fracking, and much more. Underlying all this activity is a “culture of public research” amongst a vibrant, several thousand strong community which exists both online at publiclab.org as well as locally in 20+ place-based communities. The goal of our workshop is to discuss this culture, the ethics of participation and how to keep communication open._
