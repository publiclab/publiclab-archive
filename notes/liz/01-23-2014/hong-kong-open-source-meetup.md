###Event details

Hong Kong Open Source Meetup group held an event Monday January 13th where two speakers from "Making a Difference" conference, CLKao (incredible open government activist in Taiwan) and myself shared our presentations. There were attendees from Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, and San Francisco.

This is a dynamic meetup group and it was an honor to join them. We made a solid connection with the Taiwanese activists in experimenting with the spectrometer to identify food fraud. There has been an issue with fraudulent olive oils, more to come on this as the project develops.
