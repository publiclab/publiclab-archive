With support from the [DIAL Open Source Center](https://osc.dial.community), we're again part of [Outreachy](http://outreachy.org) -- which recruits software contributors to work on open source projects:

> Outreachy provides three-month internships to work in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Interns are paid a stipend of $5,500 and have a $500 travel stipend available to them. Outreachy internship projects may include programming, user experience, documentation, illustration and graphical design, or data science. Interns often find employment after their internship with Outreachy sponsors or in jobs that use the skills they learned during their internship.
> 
> Outreachy expressly invites applicants who are women (both cis and trans), trans men, and genderqueer people to apply. We also expressly invite applications who are residents and nationals of the United States of America of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, Native American/American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander. Anyone who faces systemic bias or discrimination in the technology industry of their country is invited to apply.

This will be our third time working with Outreachy although we've been fans for some time. [Learn more about the program](http://outreachy.org) and get involved!

So, we're asking applicants to **start posting their proposals for comment**, here.

You will **still have to post your official proposals on the Outreachy website**. But we'd like to hear how different applicants build out their proposals based on our project descriptions, linked here: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/7617. Read on!

### Deadlines

Outreachy's application deadline is the 7th of April. [Full timeline here](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/project-selection/)!

### Get familiar with the project

Once you've made an initial starting contribution to our codebase (we're happy to help you with this on [our welcome page here](https://code.publiclab.org/#r=all)), We've posted a [welcome page for Outreachy people here](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/7617)! Say hello! Read carefully through our project descriptions (links coming soon) and ask questions in the comments below, or to join our chat channel at [https://publiclab.org/chat](https://publiclab.org/chat)

Our welcoming page will help you understand how we collaborate, and we'll be there to help you take your first step. As many of you have done already, [try tackling a first-timers-only issue](https://code.publiclab.org/#r=all), to get an idea of how to become a contributor!

### Post a proposal for comment

Once you've read through some of these ideas and become a bit more familiar with our projects, it's time to post a proposal of your own.

You don't need to have a complete proposal to post here -- share your thoughts early and we'll help you refine your proposal, and help you plan something that's right for you.

We've created a template for you to post a proposal here. Click this button to begin:

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="/post?n=23085&title=Outreachy%20proposal:%20&tags=software,soc,soc-2020,soc,outreachy,outreachy-2020,outreachy-2020-proposals,response:23084">Start drafting a proposal</a>

Note: Outreachy's official application is directly to the Outreachy organization, through [their website](https://outreachy.org). But we would like all Outreachy applicants to post a proposal here as well, because:

- we will review proposals here in looking over applications and indicating our preferences to folks leading up to April 7
- we think it's great to have a dialogue with teams
- we'd like to know specifically about your planning process in tackling a project or set of projects
- we're friendly!

### Read other proposals

Before or after you post your own draft, read through others' listed below. Your best comments and input may come from other applicants!

You can also read through past proposals for Outreachy at [https://publiclab.org/tag/outreachy-2019-proposals](https://publiclab.org/tag/outreachy-2019-proposals) and proposals for similar programs here: #call-for-proposals
