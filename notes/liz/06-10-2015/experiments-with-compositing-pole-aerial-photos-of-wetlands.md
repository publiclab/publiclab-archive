###What I want to do

Make image composites out of pole aerial photos of wetlands. Not maps because there isn't existing imagery detailed enough to stitch against. See this thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/grassrootsmapping/AN8PHW1tMAI

###My attempt and results

This set of images from April 18, 2015 : https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B1HdcMKx0evKfjFQNWJHeVVLSkRHMlRFN3RlSzE1LURsLWR1bGVXXzlIbmtYVlhlSkZ0VDA

I tried a couple of image composites:

[![southshore-set-3.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/295/medium/southshore-set-3.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/295/original/southshore-set-3.jpg)

[![southshore-set-1.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/297/medium/southshore-set-1.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/297/original/southshore-set-1.jpg)

###Questions and next steps

Are these useful for the people conducting wetland restoration on these sites?
