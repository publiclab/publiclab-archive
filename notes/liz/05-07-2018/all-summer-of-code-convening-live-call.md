Dear Summer of Coders (students and mentors and others), and everyone in general: 

**Tomorrow, May 8, 2018 at 8:30am Vancouver, 10:30am New Orleans and Peru, 11:30am NYC and Providence, 5:30pm Israel and Poland, 9:00pm Delhi, 11:30pm mainland China, we will be convening on https://meet.jit.si/publiclab**

For some other timezones, see http://everytimezone.com/#2018-5-8,1650,b8jj

### Who should attend

The call is open to all, however, for folks related to Summer of Code, please attend if at all possible as this is part of our Community Bonding activities: 

* STUDENTS: @MaggPi @Gauravano @namangupta @Vidit @tech4GT @mridulnagpal @bansal_sidharth2996 @sagarpreet @Souravirus @stefannibrasil and @milaaraujo
* MENTORS: @icarito, @mkashyap354, @ryzokuken, @amirberAgain, @siaw23  (me: @liz)

### How the call will be run

To begin the call, I will call people in order to say hello and share a few things about themselves such as where they are from, where they are going to school or working if that applies, some of their favorite hobbies or interests. Next, I will call project teams to give Very Brief overviews of their projects so we can all hear about each other's planned work. That's it in a nutshell, i expect good spirits and some joking around on this casual, "get to know each other" call. 

Thanks and see you tomorrow!
