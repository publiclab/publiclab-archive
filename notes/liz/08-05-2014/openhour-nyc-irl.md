Great OpenHour event last night, NYC crew met up in person at the lab. We put the google hangout on the big monitor, and shared the mac laptop around so that everyone could ask questions on camera. Great to meet new faces Steven Everett, Jeremy Seto, Elia Machado-Machado, and familiar friends Jay Holmes, Jeremy Baron, Bronwen Densmore, and Kino. For the record, Hacket wants to point out that he's there solely as Bronwen's escort.
