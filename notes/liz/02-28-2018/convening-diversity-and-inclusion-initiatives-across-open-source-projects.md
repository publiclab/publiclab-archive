Mozilla is convening a diversity and inclusion working group across open source projects, and many large communities are already involved: OpenStreetMap's Women's group, Drupal, Wordpress, Linux's CHAOSS Project, Kubernetes, Fedora, etc. Leading up to this they did a cross-project survey of projects including 90 detailed multi-modal interviews

Here's the announcement: https://medium.com/@sunnydeveloper/new-diversity-inclusion-in-open-source-community-call-52d01324e0a9 that includes links to :

- recording of their first community call: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3aPHZpgAls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3aPHZpgAls)

I'm still watching this video, and would love to discuss this with people once they watch it as well. Please comment!
