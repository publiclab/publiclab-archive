Just saw a great presentation yesterday at EPA's Region 2 Citizen Science Forum by Amy Gottsegen of Drexel University (Gwen Ottinger's student) on **http://shenangochannel.org/**. CMU's CREATE Lab is also involved but i'm not sure how the project is structured. 

* There's a timelapse video which you can browse by calendar as well as timeline, and there's additional controls like zooming in and out. 
* scrolling the video's timeline also controls the position and zoom level shown in graphs of air quality sensors, in this case, they have a few Specks installed.

It is open source: https://github.com/CMU-CREATE-Lab/the-shenango-channel

They've made a tour of their dashboard that is super helpful:
