**Public Lab is about sharing how to do things with other people.**

Have a new [method](/method) for collecting environmental data that you'd like to introduce? Great! This is for you.

_If you're not sure if you need all this just yet, try starting by posting a single [activity](/post). Once you have more documentation, you can collect it all on a method page later._

---------

**Why make a method page?**

- to collect many [activities](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-17-2016/what-makes-a-good-activity) into a coherent environmental monitoring method
- to gather questions into an FAQ
- to collect stories of using it
- to comparisons to other methods: **pros + cons**?
- to express a "design philosophy"
- to explain the "constraints" you're designing for (cost, simplicity, power?)

---------

**1\.** Read through the [template](/wiki/method-template). Notice the main sections:

- a one sentence opener/summary
- **Basis** -- quick ways to categorize what's going on with this method
- **Story** -- really getting into it
- **Activities** grid -- lists the step by step activities for using this method (it's OK to not have any yet)
- **Frequently Asked Questions** -- any question asked about your method will show up here

---------

**2\.** Take a moment to think about your method. Decide on a simple single word or hyphenated phrase to refer to your method.

---------

**3\.** Use this button to create a new page based on the method template:

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://publiclab.org/wiki/new?tags=tool,method&n=13732">Click here to create a new page</a>

In the title field, type in your word or hyphenated phrase. Stay here in editing mode (don't click publish yet)

---------

**4\.** While editing, do a "find and replace" for METHODNAME and replace each instance with your method's name. The HTML code will make sense after you hit publish. Click Publish.

---------

**5\.** On your new published page, scroll down to the tags.

- Notice that `tool` is already a tag.
- Type `METHODNAME`, replacing METHODNAME with the word for your method, and press enter.
- Then type `activities:METHODNAME`, replacing METHODNAME with the word for your method, and press enter.

_**Success!** Now start thinking about how to make a simple introduction activity for your method, the shorter the better! Read more here: [https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-17-2016/what-makes-a-good-activity](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-17-2016/what-makes-a-good-activity)_
