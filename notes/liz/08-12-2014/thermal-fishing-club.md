###What I want to do

Connect the activity of thermal fishing with existing communities of expertise, i.e. fishermen

###My attempt and results

A little bit of tech development would really go a long way. One idea is that Don and Catherine's new "Sensor in a bottle" prototype could be modified for a red and blue LED (currently it makes sounds, not colors)

###Questions and next steps

@warren made some sketches for a great jacket logo. I'm hoping he'll add them below in the comments. 

###Why I'm interested

This could be a fun, culturally relevant way of visualizing water quality data with an existing water-focused community of practice (AKA fishermen) who have a vested interest in water quality. The event model is ready-made because people already go out fishing on their own.
