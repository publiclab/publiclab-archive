###What I want to do

Better communicate what research notes are for. This could be a static illustration as @warren imagined, as well as an orientation video as @Stevie imagined. 

###My attempt and results

Just getting started here!

###Questions and next steps

A great illustration could be the cover for a pad of blank "paper research notes". Such a pad would be a great resource for organizers to hand out as they meet new people and seek to orient them to Public Lab and how Public Lab collaborates. 
<br>
A great video would also be a great resource for orienting newcomers of all stripes. 

###Why I'm interested

Research notes are a core part of Public Lab's infrastructure and culture, yet, the point of them is unclear to the newcomer and needs to be better presented.
