Hi folks!
i'm posting this as a question because in conversation over the past week, many people have already contributed many perspectives on this topic, ranging from the scientific validity side, to the education and onboarding experience, the design of the web interface, and more. Please add your perspective as an "answer"! Thank you. 

* Also, please let me know if you'd like to book club Chapter Two "The Idea of Replication" in Harry Collins' book _Changing Order: Replication and Induction in Scientific Practice_.
