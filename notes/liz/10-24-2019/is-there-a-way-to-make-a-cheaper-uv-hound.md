I'm posting on behalf of the amazing Houston organizer Bryan Parras, who shared some insights with me on the phone the other day. 

In a settlement from a lawsuit against local industry, decorated Port Arthur environmental activist Hilton Kelly (a [Goldman award winner][1]) received 2 UV mass spectrometers, known as "UV Hound": https://envcoglobal.com/catalog/air/gas-monitors/ambient-monitors/uv-hound-series . They each cost between 20K and 30K, and each can monitor abt 200'-500' of airspace.

Bryan Parras mentioned that setting devices like this along the fenceline to catch any emissions leaving the industrial site and entering fenceline communities could be quite effective.  

* are any other devices that are cheaper and similar?
* are any other groups are using these and, if so, what are their experiences?
