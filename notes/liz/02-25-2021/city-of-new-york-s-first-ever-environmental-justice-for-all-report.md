Press Release: 
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, in partnership with the NYC Environmental Justice Advisory Board (which is chaired by WE ACT's Peggy Shepard), has launched the community engagement process for the Environmental Justice For All report, an unprecedented comprehensive study of environmental justice issues that will lead to the development of a citywide Environmental Justice Plan. The engagement effort will prioritize the low-income communities and communities of color that have borne the brunt of environmental degradation, the climate crisis, and America's fossil fuel economy.

As part of this public engagement process, there will be two virtual town halls followed by a 90-day public comment period

New Yorkers can learn more about this process and contribute their feedback by visiting www.nyc.gov/EJStudy (redirects to https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cpp/our-programs/environmental-justice-study.page)

New Yorkers, especially those who live in the city's environmental justice areas (see map), can provide input via an online poll or submit comments directly – via email at ej@climate.nyc.gov or via voicemail at 212-788-4144 – by April 30, 2021
