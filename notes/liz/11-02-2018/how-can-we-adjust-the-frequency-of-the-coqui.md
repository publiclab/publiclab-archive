I sometimes enjoy the high frequency sounds of the coqui, but sometimes it's so high i actually can't hear it at all. I remember a former version of the coqui that was slowed down so much you could hear the separate clicks and the pitch was lower. On that one, the speed of clicking indicated the relative conductivity you were measuring. I'm wondering how to do this? Thanks!
