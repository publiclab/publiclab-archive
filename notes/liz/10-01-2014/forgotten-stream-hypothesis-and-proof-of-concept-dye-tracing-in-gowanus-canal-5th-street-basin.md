###What I want to do

**September 7, 2014**

This note documents Eymund's work on making the groundwater--hypothesized to be Vechtes Brook--flowing out of the 5th Street basin landfill more visible. Already, its mineral content has created its mark on both sides:

Here's the overview map created by @eymund explaining the greater significance of restoring this stream for reducing storm sewer overflows:

A few general snapshots of this basin, first in summer showing leachate:

the second in winter:

a third winter, showing how the back of the basin is melted--WHY?:

###My attempt and results

Exhibit: red food dye

Food dye poured into flowing groundwater:

Eymund "caught red handed"

###Next Steps

This was the "wet" run for the balloon aerial mapping event on September 27th, look for that note as well, tagged "gowanus" 

###some adventuring required
