<strong>NYC: Saturday April 6, 2-4pm

Higher ED Workshop: Weather scores, Wind scales, and Scattered Dances
</strong>
In these two hours we will enact and create dance scores that grow and shift our understanding of weather in the city. We will also learn how to assess wind speed by observing the movement of objects and trees around us. We will seek out micro-weather factors around the New School such as buildings that protect us from wind or redirect it, temperature differences in areas of shade or sun, and the effects of nearby traffic or street trees.If there are the right conditions for gathering aerial imagery by kite, we will fly a camera as well.  It is our hypothesis that the body is a highly tuned weather-sensing instrument, come test this with us!
