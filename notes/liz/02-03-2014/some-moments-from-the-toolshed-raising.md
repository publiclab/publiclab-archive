#Intros!

Looks like a headcount of 25+!

Katie and Will did a great job organizing this combo intro session + tool hacking. Their structure created experiences for project leaders and new comers alike. They dedicated the first hour to announcements, intros / meet-n-greet, and an informal "expo" of tools set up on tables. The second hour was a planned presentation of the new "RIffle" with slides and a projector. The third and fourth hours were open work periods, with several working groups forming around water temperature mapping, aerial thermal camera flight planning, a RPi "nozzleCam" for our new Makerbots, etc.
