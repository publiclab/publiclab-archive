Hi everyone, many people aren't able to attend Barnraising but want to follow along from afar. But how? Some ideas i've heard: 

* Broadcast a live stream so others can tune in remotely
* Post the schedule board online, with links to real-time notes 
* Set up a projector displaying social media feeds of #barnraisingXX, and encourage interaction
* Have a media table where people come to do interviews, videos, podcasts etc
