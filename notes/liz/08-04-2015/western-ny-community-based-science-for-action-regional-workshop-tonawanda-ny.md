NPR featured Tonawanda, NY in itâ€™s **Poisoned Places** series due to the toxic pollution coming off of a nearby coke plant.

On March 28th, 2013, after a month long trial in US district court, twelve jurors found Tonawanda Coke and its environmental control manager guilty of 14 criminal charges violating the Clean Air Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Some of the charges included releasing coke oven gas (containing enormous amounts of benzene and particulate matter) into the air through a pressure relief valve and not reporting the emissions to regulators.

This landmark verdict is only the **second time in US history** that a company has been indicted and convicted under the Clean Air Act, setting the precedent for a number of environmental cases to come.
