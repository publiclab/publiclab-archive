##Event details

This is a local event that is part of Science Hack Day, which coincides with both the World Science Festival and National Day of Civic Hacking.
Saturday and Sunday June 2 9AM - 10PM.
**Balloon Mapping workshop at 2pm on Sunday** led by Will Ward. 


##Background

Helium will be provided, we are looking for someone from the Public Lab community to lead this workshop! If you will lead this, please add the workshop description to http://sciencehackday.pbworks.com/w/page/65737144/nyc2013ideas%20

The World Science Festival and New York University???s Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) team up to launch Science Hack Day in New York City. This two-day event will bring together scientists, designers, developers, and innovators. Hackers work in groups to mash up ideas, media, and technologies to create quick solutions: use bacteria from dollar bills to collect NYC???s genomic data, hack micro satellites to reflect sunlight, build a distributed computer simulation of the Large Hadron Collider, and much more. Join us for hacking, workshops, and the opportunity to work side-by-side with scientists. See what you can accomplish in just two days.

How It Works: Groups form after listening to pitches by scientists. Participants can stay in one group lead by a moderator, or work with others. Awards for the best hacks will be selected by a panel of judges and presented at the finale of the Science Hack Day weekend.

Anyone interested in science, contributing ideas, or hacking is welcome. No prior experience necessary. Space is limited so registration is required to this free event. When you register, please share your interests and skills, and let us know which hack you may be interested in from our list of confirmed scientists, or suggest your own. Ages 18 and above.
