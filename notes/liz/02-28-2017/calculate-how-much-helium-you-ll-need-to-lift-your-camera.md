In the US, helium costs ~180 dollars for a large 240 cubic foot tank, or ~60 dollars for an 80 cubic foot tank. 80 cubic feet ([click for image -- 'small' size](https://publiclab.org/sites/default/files/Hico-Helium-Tanks.jpg)) **should** get you 2 flights with a 4-5 foot diameter balloon, enough to lift a camera. For mylar balloons it may only last one flight, but if you seal them well, you should be able to keep the balloons inflated in a safe place for reuse for several days.
