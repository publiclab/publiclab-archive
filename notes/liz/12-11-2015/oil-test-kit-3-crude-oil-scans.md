Here is my screenshot of my set https://spectralworkbench.org/sets/2874, three scans of crude oil using a blue laser.

My experimental setup is a bit odd so i'll attach a photo. i had to angle the spectrometer to get a scan. I also had to cut the slots on the cuvette holder 1/8" lower for two reasons: 

* so that the laser could shine in, and 
* the fluorescence could shine out and be read by the spectrometer.
