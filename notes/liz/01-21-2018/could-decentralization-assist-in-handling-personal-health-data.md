There are a few things i have in mind in asking this question,

- One, handling personal health data appropriately is pretty tough to actually do, for example check out what the SmartForm team is encountering in their app development process: [https://github.com/publiclab/SmART-Form/issues/12](https://github.com/publiclab/SmART-Form/issues/12)
- Two, a lot of folks working on data justice in all forms are working on decentralizing data storage (such as with [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), the interplanetary file system -- what a great name!).
- Three, I noticed that Tim Berners Lee's new project at MIT ([https://solid.mit.edu/](https://solid.mit.edu/)) is about decoupling personal data from applications and i'm wondering if anyone has any insight on it? Are there any other relevant projects we could be thinking about?
