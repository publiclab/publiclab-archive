**Philosophy:** these days, you can just go for the cheapest camera and get decent image quality. 

1. **Search for a used 10mp+ camera** for as little as $10, typically between $20 and $40 on [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=digital+camera&hl=en&sa=X&rls=en&biw=1033&bih=683&tbs=shop:1,cat:152,p_ord:p&prmd=ivnsurfd&ei=hJRkTcwpxsaAB_j6-bwH&ved=0CAoQuw0oAQ&bav=on.1,or.&cad=h) or [Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=canon+camera&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR1.TRC0.A0.H0.Xcanon+camera+sd.TRS0&_nkw=canon+camera+sd&_sacat=0)
* **Make sure the camera has a continuous shooting mode** so that when we send it into the air with the button mashed down, the camera will continue taking photos every second or so.
* **Consider what kind of battery the camera has:** when buying a used camera with a proprietary rechargeable battery, there is always a chance that the battery will be worn out and unsuitable for long flights of interval shooting. This is especially true if the camera is a very old model. The [Canon A490](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/15155748008481731810?hl=en#ps-sellers) takes standard AA batteries which is helpful when simply being outside might prevent you from recharging the custom battery. 
* **Buy the camera!**
