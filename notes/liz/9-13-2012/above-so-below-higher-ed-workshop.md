Title: Weather sensing with kites, bodies, and cameras
Date: September 23
Start time: 11am at Governors Island (ferry runs every half hour from Brooklyn and Manhattan): http://govisland.com

Join Higher E+D (ecology and dance) for a day of kite-mapping and dance

kites and balloons and field data from our dancing bodies.

What to bring: notebook and pen, clothes for moving and possibly getting dirty.
Please pack a picnic lunch and bring water
