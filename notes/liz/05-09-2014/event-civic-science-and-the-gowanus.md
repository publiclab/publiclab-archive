# Event--Civic Science and the Gowanus 

Join the Gowanus Canal Conservancy and The NYC Urban Field Station’s Science of the Living City Seminar series for a panel discussion on urban
civic science. Scientists and environmentalists discuss their perspectives on engaging volunteers in scientific investigations of the urban-industrial environment. Panelists will talk about their projects in the Gowanus Canal and watershed, such as aerial mapping, urban forestry surveying, canal sediment
sampling and aquatic robot data collection. A Q&A for panelists will follow. There will be an opportunity to mingle and enjoy beer, courtesy of our
beverage sponsor, Brooklyn Brewery.
