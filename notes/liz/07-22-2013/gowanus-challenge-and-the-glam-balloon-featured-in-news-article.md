The Gowanus Challenge (http://www.gowanuscanal.org/race/) is described by the Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club: 
_"The race is historic because, to the best of our knowledgeâ€¦ this is the first race where entire course, and the ensuing awards banquet will be held completely on a US Government sanctioned Superfund site."_

The NY Daily News ran a story and the above photo with the caption: **The red buoy is a helium balloon used to take water-quality-monitoring-and-planting aerial photos for the Gowanus Canal Conservancy's and Dredgers Balloon Mapping Program.**
