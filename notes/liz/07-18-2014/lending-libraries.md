Many of us have a tote bag, box, shelf, or even a bookcase full of gear. Many of us loan out this gear to a folks we know personally. Some organizers maintain a centralized storage place for their chapter where anyone can check out equipment. This cycle of storing and loaning could be described as a **Lending Library**, a concept that's never been formalized within Public Lab but nonetheless is emerging as a strong part of chapter culture.

###Gear that individuals have
There is some thought currently going into how individuals can list the equipment they have--and what of it that they'd be willing to loan--through the use of powertags on their profile pages. See https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/104.  

###Gear that chapters have
When we think about setting up a lending library to serve a chapter -- such as in  [NYC](/wiki/new-york-city), [Somerville](/wiki/somerville), [New Orleans](/wiki/gulf-coast), plus one just starting in [Chicago](/wiki/chicago) -- there are some additional questions that arise, here are just a few: 

* What stuff do we need in our lending library?
* What stuff can be used again and again, and what stuff needs to be continually replaced?
* Who much will it cost over a year?
* How do we keep track of what we're loaning out?
* How do we get stuff back in a hurry when someone else needs it?

###Let's discuss!
Let's use the comments area on this research note for a public discussion on what makes a good lending library and how this can be made visible on chapter pages (or profile pages) on publiclab.org.
