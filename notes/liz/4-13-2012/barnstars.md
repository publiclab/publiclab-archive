The idea of "barnstars" has been used in online, collaborative communities to express appreciation or recognize contribution. For example, it's very successful in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstars">Wikipedia</a>:
<em>"Some years ago, some wiki-based communities began to give their users awards called barn stars, using a star anchor to represent the concept of the shared work experience, as in barn raising."</em>
Check out Wikipedia OrangeMike's barnstars by scrolling all the way down on his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Orangemike">user page</a>. 

Public Laboratory held its <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/barnraising">first annual Barnraising</a> back in September, 2011. Following from this, how could barnstars be part of the way we recognize collaborative work?

Early history of barnstars:

<a href="http://eekim.com/blog/2006/09/intellipedia-shovel/">the CIA's "shovel" award</a> for wiki gardening? This short article is interesting because it says the shovel was both a digital and physical object, something I think would be critical for our community of online and offline members.
