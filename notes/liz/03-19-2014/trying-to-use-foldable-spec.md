###What I want to do

use the foldable spec and mobile spectral workbench in Firefox on Android

###My attempt and results

I am using spectralworkbench on android in Firefox browser. Firefox mobile is great how it asks which camera to use. Chrome didn't give the option and defaulted to front camera (FAIL).

The spectrum appears, although it needs to be rotated.

The rotate button works great.

###Questions and next steps

Once i press the "Begin Capture" button, the resulting spectrum does not look good. I no longer see the distinct bands, and i'm not sure why there are nm units along the x axis when i have not yet calibrated it. The spectrum does not appear to be spread evenly across. What's going on? Should i be doing something different on the software or perhaps the hardware?

###Why I'm interested

Because I need to teach people how to use this tool!
