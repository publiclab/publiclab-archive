The University of California Davis Center for Citizen and Community Science worked with the staff of Public Lab to create a Logic Model that we could use in evaluating our impact. Here it is, both the [direct link][1], and as an image:

## Let's take closer look
Clearly, there's a lot of densely packed information in here. Let's explore column by column; I created a graphic to illustrate each column followed by plain text:

* Corporate sponsorships
* Individual contributions
* Kits sales 
* Fiscal sponsorships

**Human Capital:**

* Communities of shared interest
* Place-based communities
* Coalitions, Networks, Movements

**Material Capital:**

* In kind equipment

* In kind physical spaces
* Free & open source resources (code, designs, publications)

**** 
### Outputs - activities

![image description][4]

* The Public Lab community (PL) convenes and maintains welcoming and respectful in-person and online spaces through the upholding of a Code of Conduct, anchored by the non-profit

* PL community exchanges, asks for, and contributes resources, strategies, supporting materials, and processes for achieving the [mission][5] -- including organizing, policy analysis, development of accessible data collection and handling methods, design and distribution of accessible hardware kits -- and supports their use

* PL staff host, maintain, and refine -- with community contribution -- collaboration platforms & processes to promote exchanges, requests, and contributions online and through printed materials

* PL organizers add structure to collaborative efforts through facilitating, project managing, matchmaking, and onboarding

* Public Lab broadly cultivates institutional & organizational partnerships, and participates in coalitions, networks, and movements

****
### Outputs - participation

![image description][6]

* *Overview: the described Outputs and Outcomes happen across, among, and beyond the Public Lab community, with the non-profit staff providing a backstop of responsibility and focus on the mission.* Refer to [Org Chart][7]. 

* **Public Lab community** is broadly defined as anyone interacting with the Public Lab ecosystem

* **Public Lab organizers** are broadly defined as anyone, including staff, who picks up facilitation, project management, matchmaking, or onboarding work

* **Public Lab staff** are employees of the US-incorporated 501(c)3 non-profit

* **Partners & collaborators** may include individuals, communities of shared interest, place-based communities, non-profit organizations, civil servants and government agencies, elected officials at any level of government, academic institutions, firms, among others

* **Coalitions, networks, and movements** are assemblages working toward aligned goals

## Outcomes - short term
These short-term outcomes are numbered for ease of reference, and the image contains abbreviated text to make these faster to comprehend by new readers: 

![image description][8]

* 1 - Resources are available to do environmental data and information gathering at quality levels relevant for organizing and advocacy (Kits Initiative)

* 2 - Local data collection projects contribute perspectives on environmental concerns and galvanize community organization

* 3 - PL community members exchange stories, resources, methods, equipment, and strategies across lived experiences, domains of expertise, and networks

* 4 - PL community activity and interaction increases in quality and quantity, particularly dialogue 

* 5 - PL community members learn concepts, attitudes, and skills, as well as benefit from interacting in Public Lab

* 6 - PL maintains existing and develops new institutional & organizational partnerships, and continues and expands participation in coalitions, networks, and movements
****
## Outcomes - medium term
![image description][9]

* PL community members advocate for locally determined goals, projects, and needs through data and community organizing

* Community projects gain exposure and problem solving capacity; Initiation of projects increases

* PL community members develop methods and materials for public use, and others use these tools and materials for their own projects

* PL community members take ownership of scientific knowledge generation and sharing

* Organizational partnerships are strong, sustained, and provide the basis for a larger, well-connected network

* Government, academia, professional associations, and civil society respect and have positive perceptions of different kinds of local knowledge and expertise
****
## Outcomes - long term

![image description][10]

* The public has greater capacity to monitor, understand, and critique existing decision-making through data that strengthens accountability

* The public’s improved collaboration skills in addressing complex, systemic issues lead to improved, more equitable governance, reducing injustice

* Community science, and free & open source projects are promoting justice and equity 

* Community science, and free & open source practices are prevalent in environmental monitoring projects 

* Open licensing and publishing is built into all publicly funded research and development for environmental monitoring

* There is political will for the public sector to maintain its responsibility for ensuring equitable environmental health through science-based policy
