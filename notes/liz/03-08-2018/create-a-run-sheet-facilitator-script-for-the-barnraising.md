Here's the run sheet for the 2017 Annual Barnraising: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1erkclv17M25gp_NOBb2XiIkqajssBO2kN_VWYENlgK4/edit

It begins with "night before barnraising" set-up activities, and contains the full speaking script for welcoming everyone, facilitating the self-organized schedule, and announcing committees and how to join them. 

Make a copy of this, and edit away! make sure to change the names -- getting many other people to help run the Barnraising is awesome!
