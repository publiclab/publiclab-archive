The lead image is a good example how to present a set of nametags: alphabetized and organized on the Welcome table. Make sure you have blank cards and extra holders for surprise drop-ins!


### Layout

Here's a link to a google presentation you can copy, fill in with your own names, and add extra pages to as needed: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1IzHM4OiROFkzF8ig0HLFttedGB33wQsNA8JbhWUwua4/edit

The layout was designed for: 

* 3"x4" cards with dotted border to cut on
* The person's name is the biggest -- make sure you doublecheck spelling and accents!
* Boots logo
* A blank line __________________ for a set of preferred pronouns, example "she, her, hers"
* enough room at the top for special marking tape indicating that someone is on ConductCom
* extra blank space for: 
  * an optional "do not photograph" sticker
  * tiny, adorable stickers

### Supplies

* printer paper
* a printer
* The template (linked above and [here][2]) a layout program (Google Slides? Microsoft Word?) where you can layout 3"x4" squares
* scissors to cut the 3"x4" squares out
* nametag holders -- often the most expensive part of nametags! Are there options to the plastic sleeve and elastic lanyard??
* tiny, adorable stickers (usually of plants, animals, landscapes, and people) 
* purple tape for indicating ConductCom
* colorful dot stickers to indicate anything else of significance, like "do not photograph"
* markers for writing the names of surprise attendees, or anything else!

### Steps

* layout the nametags (use the template)
* print them out, including a few extra blanks where people can write in their own name
* cut them out
* put them in the plastic sleeves
* alphabetize them 
* pack them in a box to bring to Barnraising venue later that night or the next day
* once arrived, set up a Welcome table and lay them out
