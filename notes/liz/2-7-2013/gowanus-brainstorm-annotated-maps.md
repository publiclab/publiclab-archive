<em>Organizer <a href="/people/gwirth">Gena Wirth</a> shows her large format print</em>
<strong>Exercise on feature design for annotated maps:</strong>
I WANT a static presentation map
SO THAT i can easily print & show to people who visit the canal

I WANT to add annotation 
SO THAT i can tell this story

I WANT control over the annotation 
SO THAT random people don't add crap to our map

I WANT a slider bar for historical imagery 
SO THAT i can show what we've done to improve this site

I WANT it to be clear and beautiful
SO THAT people aren't overwhelmed with this information

<strong>Related to sub-project of plant census</strong>
I WANT a complete inventory in the Gowanus plant census
SO THAT i can track change over time

I WANT a shareable plant census
SO THAT the public can have access to it, and users can begin to extrapolate other information from it, such as biomass, biodiversity, associated animals 

I WANT to display the chemical contents of these plants
SO THAT we can understand the ecology of the Gowanus

I WANT to be able to zoom into each plant and see photos
SO THAT we can seamlessly view environmental information

I WANT great search engine results for phrases like "plants of the gowanus"
SO THAT people can encounter this project as many ways as possible

<strong>What has been built in the Public Lab prototype so far?</strong>
<strong>(v01)... </strong>

* Point annotation
* Polygons with info windows, choice of 6 colors. 
* <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffreywarren/8423695909/in/photostream">Images embedded in info windows</a> 
* <a href="https://mapknitter.org/map/view/occupyucdavis-nov-21-2011">Videos embedded in info windows</a>
* Map owner can delete any annotations by anyone, otherwise you can only delete the ones you added yourself

<strong>What are possible planned additions:</strong>
<strong>(v02)...</strong>

* Categories, color-coding by category
* Legends with category filter
* The owner of the map can "lock" it in mapknitter as a presentation map
* MapKnitter annotations and interactivity preserved in archive - (geoJSON export, readable by plots2 Archive)

<strong>(v03)... </strong>

* Options for geometry like squares, circles 
* Line styles, line weight, line color, opacity
* point icons like "the pointing hand"
* Mobile page at mapknitter.org has prompt for annotations based on smartphone GPS location
* Downloadable annotations (see v02 above)

<strong>What are other feature ideas by the Gowanus Canal Conservancy?</strong>

* Ability to upload all points from other data collection initiatives all at once from a spreadsheet or a shapefile
  * for instance, points collected by a device, or sensor data in CSV
* Ability to overlay other geographic data like tree canopy layers
  * Use existing platforms like mapbox (?) for their existing feature set for drawing (?)
