Green Hunan is a civil society organization in China that organizes volunteers to monitor the watershed of the Xiang River, a major tributary of the Yangtze River. See their website 
http://www.greenhunan.org.cn/

In a brief meeting on Wednesday, November 23, I had a chance to sit down with a staff person of GreenHunan and learn some basic facts about their approach to environmental monitoring: 

 - They created a "field kit" box containing an educational card game, and a version of GreenovationHub's water test kit. 
- they train volunteers on water monitoring at a large annual conference event each fall
- of the 122 prefectures in Hunan province, 67 have active Green Hunan volunteers
- there are 400 volunteers active per week
- these volunteers submit around 15 reports of violations per month to either the Chinese EPA pollution reporting hotline #12369, or to the local mayor's office #12345
- On average, every week, the government solves 1 to 2 of these reported problems.

Excited to learn more form Green Hunan and keep sharing water monitoring strategies!
