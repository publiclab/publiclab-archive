Want to show others how to make balloon or kite maps? Need help mapping a large site or doing long-term mapping? Want to start a local group of balloon mappers? Great! FYI, this activity has been updated from a [previous research note of the same name](/wiki/host-balloon-mapping-workshop).

We can use the comments below to exchange advice on how to organize and run a balloon mapping workshop, and keep this updated. 

##First steps##

* Get the word out! * Compile a list of emails of local interested people. Write everybody to say hello and suggest using one of the [email lists](/lists). Also reach out over Facebook, Twitter, etc.
* Figure out a good day (preferably morning for low wind) to meet. (try using a [Doodle](http://doodle.com)), and then [post a clear event](/post) with date/time/location, etc. 
* Ask people what equipment they can bring: not just balloon mapping gear but cameras, gps, maps. If you're mapping on the water, ask if anyone has a boat!
* Review the [balloon mapping](/wiki/balloon-mapping) page and links and be sure you have all the supplies you need
  * Helium may require ordering more than one day in advance. 
* How many people can you teach at a workshop? A good rule of thumb is 4-6 people _per mapping kit_, each group should also have at least one person who's mapped before.

##The night before##

* Check your checklists! Download checklists and guides here
* Print enough [illustrated balloon mapping guides](/guides) in the right language if it exists
* Print out some [Welcome to Public Lab handouts](/wiki/welcome)
* Confirm the weather report, and check in with your expected participants if there's any doubt!

##Workshop day##

* If you are the organizer, arrive early to the meeting spot!
* Hand around a notepad to [sign newcomers up on the mailing list](/wiki/invitations)
* Some people like to start by showing [MapKnitter](https://mapknitter.org) so that participants know how the images will be processed ahead of time. Sometimes by the end of the day everyone's too tired to break out a laptop and start stitching images.
* Bring and fill out a [Flight Log entry](/wiki/mapping-flight-log) with field notes and key data about your mapping site

##Followup##

* Be sure to upload and share the best of the images freely (i.e. under an [open license](/wiki/licenses)) with your new colleagues. Contact organizers@publiclab.org to find a place to host them on the Public Lab site (like MapMill.org)
