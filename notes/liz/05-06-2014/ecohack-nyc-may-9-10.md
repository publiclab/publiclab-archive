###Location

The New York City location of EcoHack World (see http://publiclab.org/notes/liz/05-06-2014/ecohack-in-four-global-locations) will be held this weekend at **Etsy**--come join us!

**55 Washington St.** <br />
**Brooklyn, NY** <br />
**11201 (Suite 712)** <br />

##Schedule

**Friday May 9th:**
Meet for pizza at 6:30PM, talks starting at 7:15PM. Afterward, we'll go out for beers, get to know each other, and talk about project plans.

So far, the main Public Lab project being pitched is to [build a sampling environment for oil fluorescence spectroscopy](http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/03-14-2014/oil-fluorescence-testing-station-from-a-spectrometer-box), and then go get samples to test. Blue lasers will be provided!

**Saturday May 10th:**
This is an unconference, which means that after the Ignite talks on Friday we will divide into small groups on Saturday and actually work on solutions.

Bring your laptop, hardware, balloons, and data and be ready to hack. At the end of the day we all come back together to show off our results.

###Background

EcoHack is a partnership between Public Lab, [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/), [ecolab](http://ecolab.oeco.org.br/), and [datalab](http://datalab.wri.org/).
