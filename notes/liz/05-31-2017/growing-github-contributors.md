We made this gif of github contributor activity each year from 2013 to 2017 during March, April, and May -- that's the time period that the [evaluation project](https://publiclab.org/notes/Shannon/03-01-2016/creating-an-evaluation-framework-for-public-lab) is studying. The large jump in 2016 -- and of course 2017's current snapshot -- is primarily attributable to "first timers only" culture. By the way, spot the impressive activity spikes during 2016's summer of code! Shout out to all GSOCers -- looking forward to another great summer!
