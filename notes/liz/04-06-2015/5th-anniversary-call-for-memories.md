Hi, all! Jeff and I spent a little time remembering some of our favorite moments from over the past 5 years. 

**We'd like to ask people to share a moment they treasure in working with Public Lab -- either as a short video or with a photograph and a sentence or two.** 

More information at the bottom of this post.

**[Jeff](/profile/warren):** _One memory that brings a smile to my face is the time a few of us were out in the wetlands of Barataria Bay with Alex Kolker and Alex Ameen in a boat, balloon mapping the islands which were hit so hard by oil during the BP spill. Adam dropped the anchor in so we could try to take a measurement of the shore eroding, but the end of the chain wasn't tied, and it the rope just ran all the way out and plopped into the water as we watched in disbelief. After 40 minutes of searching the muddy bottom of the marsh, [Adam](/profile/Adam-Griffith) surfaced with the anchor, and our bickering turned to relief. That was also the trip where we first prototyped a dual camera rig for infrared wetlands analysis!_

**[Liz](/profile/liz):** _I will always remember a particularly arctic day in January 2011, when a dozen of us jumped into canoes and dug our paddles through a frozen Gowanus Canal. We were flying a balloon camera to search for unusual patterns of ice melts that would reveal illegal chemical dumps - and we found them. That day, our small crew were the only ones freezing our feet off, but by open sourcing our methods, we were supporting and were supported by some of the most heartfelt people across the internet -- the global Public Lab community._

###Now it's your turn! 

**Share your stories with the community. Pick one of these prompts:**

- whatâ€™s a moment you remember from the past 5 years?
- why did you get involved with Public Lab?
- what does Public Lab mean to you?
- what do you love about Public Lab?
- What is your vision for how community collected data / DIY tools / open collaboration can change the way we work / science as a field?

**Post your notes, photos, and embedded videos here in the comments -- we're eager to see them all, and potentially make a mashup community portrait.**

###Bonus tips for making a video "shelfie"

* If you're going the video route, start by introducing yourself slowly and clearly as "Hi, my name is [MyAwesomeName]."
* Then take a breath before restating your chosen prompt as the start of your story. "I got involved with Public Lab because [MyAwesomeReason]"
* Keep the whole thing to 3-4 short and simple sentences.
* That's it! Upload somewhere and post / embed the link here.
