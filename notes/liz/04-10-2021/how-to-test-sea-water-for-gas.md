There's a known discharge point from an gasoline refinery on the coast of the Dominican Republic, in the Haina industrial area, discharging into the Caribbean Ocean. My colleague is curious what's in it. The youth, who have to cross the discharge canal in order to reach their swimming spot, say in regard to the discharge canal, "Don't step in that water, do you smell it? The gas? Don't touch it!" 

But what is the actual content? How can my colleague take a water sample in a way that preserves the volatiles for analysis by a lab? What services would a lab have to offer to be able to test such a water sample? Are there other ways that might document discharge from a gasoline refinery, or any of the byproducts of the crude oil refining process?
