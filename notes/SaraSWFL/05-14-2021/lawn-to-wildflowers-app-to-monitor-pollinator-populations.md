I'm working on an urban pollinator corridor project and am looking at tools to monitor insect populations in my area. The ['Lawn to Wildflowers' app](https://www.lawntowildflowers.org/ "https://www.lawntowildflowers.org/")' looks promising, as it has a game that trains people to ID insects correctly before they begin data collection.

How do I go about evaluating a tool like this for suitability? What sort of questions do I need to ask? 

Are there other tools for collecting insect population data that should also be considered?
