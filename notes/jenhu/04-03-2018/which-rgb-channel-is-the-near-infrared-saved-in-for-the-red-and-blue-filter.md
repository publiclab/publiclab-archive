In a typical color image, that is taken from a Canon point and shoot camera, has three color channels (RGB). They are called RGB because they are the Red, Green, and Blue channels. When the IR blocking filter is replaced with either the red or blue IR passing filter, provided by Infragram, what happens to these channels? What is specifically stored in the R, G, or B channel? What acronym should I call the blue and the red filter (i.e. NGB, RGN, etc). 

  
Thanks!
