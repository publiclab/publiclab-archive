This image was taken using a Skyhook 30 parafoil kite with a Cannon G9 camera.  The wind was fairly consistent and pretty strong this day, so lifting the G9 wasn't a problem.  The photos were stitched with Hugin, an open source panorama program.  Because of the changing nature of the beach, using Map Knitter wasn't an option.  The green plants are sea grass and the rocky area is seasonally exposed cobbles (they are exposed in winter and buried in sand in the summer).  The area in the upper portion of the photograph is under water but most of the cobbles are exposed.
