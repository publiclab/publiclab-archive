I made a few notes on an idea I had to estimate the slit width of PLOTS-type spectrometers using a reference atmospheric irradiance spectrum. Slides on the idea are posted in the image gallery included with this post.     

The slit width of the spectrometer is one of the main characteristics of the device that governs the appearance of the measured spectra.  

I haven't tried this method with a PLOTS-type spectrometer, but would be glad to work with someone who has built one and wants to explore some of its characteristics.
