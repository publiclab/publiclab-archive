###What I want to do: gain more knowledge on the processes involved with public lab and learn more about citizen science overall.

###My attempt and results: The results have been okay so far, but I would love some feedback!

###Questions and next steps: 
        Why do you use public lab?
        Are you a 'nerdy/science' type of person? (need to know the culture of you guys!)
        Do you enjoy your contributions as citizen scientists?

###Why I'm interested: I am interested because I mainly need the grade. I also learned about citizen science in my environmental science class, and have found it interesting that everyday people can go out and contribute to awesome, large scale science projects.
