MQI Recorder is now available for pre-order via [Citizen Scientific Workshop](http://www.citizenscientificworkshop.com/kits/mqi-environmental-recorder-preorder) and a portion of the proceeds of each unit will be donated to help support Public Lab.
My quest to build an easy to assemble, use, and hack multi-function environmental recorder. Made using open hardware an household materials. 

The MQI currently carries a thermal flashlight, and two gas sensors.  It is derived from the thermal photography project here on Public Lab, and inspired by other projects such as citizen air quality mapping projects like FLOAT. My desires were to create the beginnings of an expandable platform built to enable people everywhere to record data from their environment, and with the included MQI mobile app (in development)  share that data to maps and locations via the internet.

The MQI defaults to the thermal flashlight mode, and pressing one of the two buttons switched the RGB LED to display each of the gas sensors with the same mapping function as the thermal flashlight. 

Currently the MQI carries a functioning IR thermometer, MQ-2 for Methane, Butane, LPG, and smoke, and MQ-7 for Carbon Monoxide.  Any sensors can be used, and I am currently pondering what might be the most beneficial combinations.
 
UPDATE 1/14/14 _ Finished up a nice acrylic case for the MQI, Transparent is my favorite color, it shows all of the blinky lights.  I think that both a papercraft version and more permanent acrylic or wood case will be nice, as one can save on cost, and the other can encase the unit when strapped to a kite, or taped on top of your car or something... ;)

We have made some significant progress on the app as well, a demo version of which is also available here:
