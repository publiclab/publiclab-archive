Outreach plan: The second part of the project that is upgradation to the bootstrap 4 from bootstrap 3 is a big project. There I will like to invite new contributors to join the public labs and to contribute to my project and thus, ultimately to the public labs.

As I did earlier, I will be engaged in making fto issues related to other ongoing milestones too.

#### What is broader goal your project working towards?

Socialisation and code enhancement

#### What resources will you need: people, documentation, literature, sample data, hardware if applicable

The contributors, mentors and the team members of the open source community are the most relevant resources for completion of the project. Also, I will be learning more from their official documentation. I believe my Mentors guidance will perhaps be the greatest resource for me.

Getting more people involved in open projects is not an easy task. Lowering the barrier for non-technical people will lower the effort that needs to be taken to get enough volunteers. As a side-effect, more people get in contact with science and they will see that it does not need an academical background to be a scientist. This surely is a benefit in multiple ways.

### Setup

_Have you forked the relevant codebases? Installed them in a dev environment such as [Cloud9.io](http://Cloud9.io/)? Need help doing so? Please provide a link to each of the above._

Yes, I have forked the GitHub repo and deployed it on my local machine.

### Experience

and many more

There are also many existing issues and pull requests currently in progress by me.

Thus, I am comfortable with Pull request and Github. Yes, I have read the contribution guidelines

### Teamwork

_Describe teams you've worked with before, whether the open or closed source and in what capacity you participated. Cite examples of how you were self-motivated and self-sufficient._

I started learning RoR a year before apart from my university curriculum, so I had to learn and understand those concepts myself. I think I can achieve every goal by hard work and giving time.

Yeah, I have worked in a group of two. Nicolas Santiago Blair and I have done two small projects Contact Manager and Event Manager together with Pair Programming in order to learn. As we lived in different countries so it was developed by both of us by collaborating at cloud9\. We did each commit together while having a phone call on skype.

Links to the projects GitHub repositories:

[https://github.com/SidharthBansal/EventManager](https://github.com/SidharthBansal/EventManager), [https://github.com/nsantiagoblair/EventManagerr](https://github.com/nsantiagoblair/EventManagerr)

and [https://github.com/nsantiagoblair/contact\_manager/commits/master](https://github.com/nsantiagoblair/contact_manager/commits/master)

Regarding teamwork, I found it very motivating to get support from more experienced developers, like @ebarry and @warren. I was only able to commit to open source with their help

### Expertise

_Would you describe yourself as especially good at or interested in some aspect of coding or problem solving, or open source science? Provide examples and links. Are you particularly suited to this proposed project?_

I am very good at competitive coding. I have done 500+ questions on various competitive programming websites like Codechef, Spoj, Hacker Rank, etc. One can see my stop stalk profile to see it at [https://www.stopstalk.com/user/profile/bansal\_sidharth2996](https://www.stopstalk.com/user/profile/bansal_sidharth2996). It lists clearly how much I have done on which site and of which category.

So, I am good at problem-solving.

Also, it has been around one and a half year learning Ruby on Rails. I have done many projects on Ruby on Rails like Pinteres\_clone, Reddit\_clone, Recipe box Event Manager, Podcast, Contact Manager etc. These projects are present on my GitHub account.

I have also done some projects in a group of two like Contact Manager and Event Manager by doing Pair Programming.

In open source, I have contributed to the Opensuse and Public Lab.

Yes, I think I am suitable for this project

### Audience

_Whom will your work serve? Lay users, other programmers, non-technical people or nerds? While exploring advanced techniques is great, we especially appreciate proposals which make technologies and techniques more legible and user-friendly to non-technical users._

My proposal's implementation will be beneficial to all users.

The proposal deals with the **ease of the login** for new and old users.

Also, it caters the needs of the Facebook-savvy people. People will be able to **post onto the existing research notes through facebook**. This will **increase the number of people involved in the Public Lab community.**

The second part deals with the better user experience which comes in with Bootstrap 4

### Context

_What motivates you to do the proposed work? Do you also have coursework or degree related reasons for pursuing it? This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing - if you are for example looking to explore work related to a thesis topic._

A man should always accept challenges which are difficult for him/her to come out of his/her present domain. Challenges make a man stretch over what you currently are. So, challenges motivate me.

I am a person who can't sit idle. I want to explore more and more things. So, my inquisitiveness to know more motivates me the most.

I am a second-year university student. I am inside the Computer Science Department. So, in my curriculum, I have DBMS, Web Development, Software Engineering and many other related subjects which are beneficial for the fulfilment of this project.

Also apart from my college, I am doing an online Rails Bootcamp -- The Odin Project available at [www.theodinproject.com](http://www.theodinproject.com/). So, I have related coursework and reasons for pursuing it.

Yeah, I want to write research papers in my 3rd year of the university.

### Ongoing involvement

_Explain how you intend to continue being an active member of your project and/or Public Laboratory AFTER the summer is over._

Even after the summer gets over I want to continue contributing to [plots2](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2) and become an active member of Publiclab community.

There are many issues related to the UI/UX at Public Labs. Also, new issues in future will evolve with time. I will give my best to make it resolve them and add new features to the codebase.

### Commitment

_Do you understand this is a serious commitment, equivalent to a full-time paid summer internship or summer job?_

Yes, I am fully aware that it is a full-time summer [i](http://internship.As/)internship. As it is of three months duration and its a small period of duration so, I will only choose those online courses which are related to the completion of my project. Also, Google is paying me for it, hence, I am fully committed to working on it throughout the summer. I will give my 100% to it.
