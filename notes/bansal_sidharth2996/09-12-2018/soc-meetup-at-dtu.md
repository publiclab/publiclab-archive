@sagarpreet and I organized a seminar at Delhi Technological University on 10th September 2018 as written in the proposal made in month of March. The even started at 3:30 pm and went till 7pm. More than 100 students participated in the event. The students were from many colleges all over Delhi. Some of the college who participated in this event were DTU, Maharaja Agrasen College, Northern IP, etc.   

In the talk, we explained about the open source software. How to start contributing to OSS organisations? We discussed about various programs such as Google Code In, Google Summer Of Code, Rails Girls Summer Of Code, Outreachy and many more. We discussed their timelines and how to write proposals and get accepted in GSOC. We then told about our community ie Public Labs. What different technological stacks are present in our organisation. We discussed our SoC projects. We ended the seminar with our excellent experience at Public Labs.
