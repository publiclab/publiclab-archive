## Project

description

#### Abstract/summary

(<20 words)

Enhancing advanced features and capabilities for the Research
Notes such as spreadsheets, maps, documents ,power tags ,etc. to
improve User Experience.

**Describe the need your project fulfils:**

Open data projects rely on volunteers to gather data. Generally,
the more data the better conclusions can be drawn. The barrier to
contribute to a project needs to be lowered. This projects approach
is to reduce the barrier by giving more capabilities to the research
notes so that the user can propose their work in a better way by
providing spreadsheets, maps, forms etc.

#### How will your project meet this need

The Project fulfils all these issues by creating different
categories or templates for different sections such as proposal,
event ,meet up, query, help, request ,scholar notes , reports and much
more. These different section would be having capabilities of using Google documents , spreadsheets, maps, form generators (like Google
forms) etc.

Goals:

- Creating a Help
section with three fields query , suggestion and contribute.
- Creating a
report page .
- Creating
proposal page.
- Creating a
meet-up page with registration form for meetup.
- Creating a
Scholar notes page for Information based articles.
- Adding more
power tags and other functionality for more user interactivity .

Setting up of proposal page.

Creating

#### Time-line/milestones

**Community Bonding Period( Before ****30****th May)**

- Get familiar with drupal.
- Getting more in touch with the
mentor.
- Get more familiar with the
codebase of [plots2](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2)
- Read documentation on various gems
we will be going to use and the existing ones.
- Discuss ideas with Mentors and
interact with them.
- Working on fixing the bugs so that I gain more experience and
contribute more towards the Project.
- Completing The Odin Project as mentioned on
[theodinproject.com](http://theodinproject.com) to learn more about RoR.
- Discussing more about the project with the mentor.

**Phase 1 - ****Create Meet-up section** **(****30****th********May -- ****15****th** **June)**

This
section will compromise of date, time and venue for the meet-up which
the organizer will set up .Organizer will also set up information
related to the meet-up. In addition , it will supply a form , which
who want to attend the conference or meet-up can fill in. There would
also be maps for the ease of the participants of the meet-up.

In addition to it, the user who would be filling the form has to authenticate and authorize themselves via sign up etc.

30th May and 5th June creating the models, controllers ,routes and views for the proposal page.

5th-10th Creating the Registration form for the user to login and register for the event or meet up.

11th-15th Creating the relationship between the registration form and the user who has logged in the public labs so that he or she doesn't have to give much details. Also creating the tests related to it.

\*\*Phase 2 -\*\*****Create a proposal section:** (15th June - 19th June)**

In this section , the user would be able to draft a proposal having
the adequate details of the proposal. Eg. What is the main agenda of the
proposal or the issue on which the organization want to work upon
and how will the organization handle that issue.How people will be benefited by the proposal .What are the requirements of the set up
needed.Current status of the project about which proposal is and
many others .These would be the different fields in the proposal section.

**Mid-term Evaluation Period(20th June - 2****8th
June)**

This time will be utilized to fix any bugs and submitting
evaluations.

\*\*Phase 3 -\*\*****Create ****an Reports
section** : ****(2****9****th June --
****14****th July)**

This section will be related to the reports of
events and experiments which happened previously . People will give
information related to the experiment which they did.

**Phase 4 - ****Create** **Scholar Notes
section**:******(15****th July --
****26****t****h****July)**

In this section ,contributors will be able to write
thesis, research papers, theoretical articles related to their
research work. They would be able to add information related to
their observations in spreadsheets etc.

**Phase 5 - ******Create** **Help Section : **(2****6th********July**- ****10th August)****

****This section will be having four fields -queries, requests , help
needed and contribution related help .Contributors will be able to raise there queries
and problems through this.Other contributors could be able to then
help them in near future.****\*\*

**Phase ****6****-- ****Adding features (11****th********August-****20****th****August)**

New
features can be added to the existing pages ,like adding ? Symbols
near the fields so that the user can click on them and can know what
to write.Adding n**ew advanced power tags.**

**Final Submission Period(****21****th
August - 2****9th August)**

I will use this time for writing final documentation according to
GSoC guidelines and checking that all tests pass or any Bug fixes in
the code and submitting final evaluations.\*\*\*\*\*\*

#### What broader goal is your project working towards?

The Project shares major sources of information these days . By
making a user friendly pages for posting research papers website and
posting research articles ,event details, etc. for various
environmental issues . So we can listen to a greater mass and take
initiatives for environmental issues which is one of the major aim of
Public Lab. In addition to it ,people will also able to write
proposals for sponsorship and many more.

#### What resources will you need: people, documentation, literature,

sample data, hardware if applicable

The contributors ,mentors and the team members of the open source
community are the most relevant resources for completion of the
project .Also I will be learning more about Javascript and Ruby on
Rails from their official documentation. I believe my Mentors
guidance will perhaps be the greatest resource for me.

Getting more people involved in open projects is not an easy task.
Lowering the barrier for non-technical people will lower the effort
that needs to be taken to get enough volunteers. As side-effect, more
people get in contact with science and they will see that it does not
need an academical background to be a scientist. This surely is a
benefit in multiple ways.

### Setup

_Have you forked the relevant codebases? Installed them in a
dev environment such as [Cloud9.io](http://Cloud9.io)? Need help doing so? Please provide
a link to each of the above._

Yes I have forked the github repo and deployed it on my local
machine.

### Experience

_Describe your technical background; what languages you use,
what projects you've contributed to before, links to GitHub or other
code repositories or samples. Have you read the Contributor
Guidelines at
[https://publiclab.org/wiki/contributing-to-public-lab-software](https://publiclab.org/wiki/contributing-to-public-lab-software)
and are you comfortable submitting pull requests?_

I have great interest in Web developer and want to discover and
learn more on Web development and Open Source projects so that I can
innovate something new. I am quite new to open source and just
getting a hang of it. But I have the eagerness to learn and complete
any Projects assigned to me with full dedication. I love to work
hard.

**Skills and expertise:**

**Languages** C, C++, Java, Ruby.

**Web Technologies** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript , Ruby
on Rails, MySQL.

**Version Control System** Git.

**Image Processing** : OpenCV.

### Teamwork

_Describe teams you've worked with before, whether open or
closed source, and in what capacity you participated. Cite examples
of how you were self-motivated and self-sufficient._

I am currently a member of Delhi Technological University's
Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Team (DTU-AUV) .I am working in
Computer Vision and Machine Vision department.

DTU-AUV is a team for making Autonomous Underwater Vehicles . It
uses ros & opencv.

I started learning RoR this year apart from my university
curriculum, so I had to learn and understand those concepts myself. I
think we can achieve anything which we want with two things that are
time and labour. That certainly I always try my best to give.

Regarding teamwork I found it very motivating to get support by
more experienced developers.

### Expertise

_Would you describe yourself as especially good at or
interested in some aspect of coding or problem solving, or open
source science? Provide examples and links. Are you particularly
suited to this proposed project?_

Yet I am a beginner but I am very stern about my work . You can
mark my words that if I would be be selected I would give my 100% . I
can really work hard and devotedly. I have started learning Ruby on
Rails from last 2 months and I have done many courses since then
.Here are a list of them: Ruby on Rails Introductory Coursera Course,
Ruby Course of Codeacademy , Ruby on Rails course on codeacademy ,
Rails for Zombies course 1 and 2 from codeschool(A Pluralsight Company). I have also gone
through udacity's git and github tutorials and basic Linux and
command line tutorials. I have also seen the videos of HTML,css,html5, javascript and ruby from newboston channel.I did this
with the exams going on in our college in March.

I am currently working hard to complete the odin project as
mentioned on [theodinproject.com](http://theodinproject.com)

I am also pretty good in Competitive
Programming in C++ and C. I am doing that since a year.

### Audience

_Whom will your work serve? Lay users, other programmers,
non-technical people or nerds? While exploring advanced techniques is
great, we especially appreciate proposals which make technologies and
techniques more legible and user-friendly to non-technical users._

Generally this project targets everyone, but especially
non-technical users will profit. For them it will become dramatically
easier to contribute to open data projects. In consequence such
projects will profit both of them. For the non - technical people it
would greatly help them to search through relevant content and
raising their questions effectively and sharing their proposed
solutions. For technical people and open source contributors it would
greatly attract them to contribute more towards improving its functionality for improving the website thus popularizing their
research work.

### Context

_What motivates you to do the proposed work? Do you also have
coursework or degree related reasons for pursuing it? This wouldn't
necessarily be a bad thing - if you are for example looking to
explore work related to a thesis topic._

I have always wanted to become a good Web developer and open
source developer. Working on this Project would greatly help me
towards fulfilling this goal as well as I would be able to learn
great many things. Also I have seen [plots2](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2)
is very encouraging for new developers. As the mentors of this organization are very friendly .

### Ongoing

involvement

_Explain how you intend to continue being an active member of
your project and/or Public Laboratory AFTER the summer is over._

Even after the summer gets over I want to continue contributing to
[plots2](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2) and become
an active member of Public lab community. I also have other features
in mind that can be be implemented. One such idea is adding up-votes
and down-votes for the research notes posted like stack overflow.

### Commitment

_Do you understand this is a serious commitment, equivalent to
a full-time paid summer internship or summer job?_

Yes ,I am fully aware that it is a full time summer internship .As
it is of three months duration and its a small period of duration so,
I will only choose those online courses which are related to the
completion of my project.Also , Google is paying me for it,hence, I
am fully committed to work on it throughout the summer.\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
