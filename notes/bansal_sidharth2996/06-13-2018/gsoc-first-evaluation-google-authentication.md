This page is about the Multi-Party Authentication System of Public Labs created in the first evaluation of Google Summer Of Code 2018

# Sign Up

1. Sign Up via the sign-up form: One can fill in the sign-up form available at [publiclab.org/signup](http://publiclab.org/signup) and create his/her account.
2. Sign Up via provider:

\* Sign up via provider for New User: If he wants to sign up via provider then he/she logs in via his/her provider's account. Then a new account is generated for the user along with the provider's information as user-tag available on [www.publiclab.org/profile/user\_name](http://www.publiclab.org/profile/user_name) page. An email is sent so that he/she can set his/her password.

The following video explains well

\* Sign up of existing user: For an existing user, if he/she clicks on Sign Up via providers on the [www.publiclab.org](http://www.publiclab.org) then the provider's information is linked to his/her existing account and he/she is logged in. The existing user is checked via the email address in Public Lab database.

The following video explains this:

# Log In

A user can either log in via username and password or via clicking on desired provider's icon on the header or on [www.publiclab.org/login](http://www.publiclab.org/login).

The following video explains login via provider

# Linking of providers to the user account

A user can link multiple providers to his account by going to the [www.publiclab.org/edit](http://www.publiclab.org/edit) and connecting the desired provider. The following video explains this logic

# Delinking of a provider

A user may want to delete a provider so he/she can go to [www.publiclab.org/profile/user\_name](http://www.publiclab.org/profile/user_name) and can delete the oauth:providers\_name:uid usertag.

The following video explains this

# Linking of account to the same provider again

If a user tries to add another account of the same provider then he is notified with a flash message. This logic is well explained in the following video
