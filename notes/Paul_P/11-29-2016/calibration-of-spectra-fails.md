###What I want to do or know
I am trying to calibrate my first CFL spectrum taken with the public labs smartphone spectrometer. The save fails with a permanent spinning wheel on the save button and a "Tag you've applied couldn't be saved" warning. See the attached screenshot and link to the spectra.

###Background story[](https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/92420)
I am using a MacOS Sierra v10.12 and  Google Chrome Version 54.0.2840.98 (64-bit).
The same issue occurs if I use Safari.

I would be really grateful for some help on what I am doing wrong.

Thanks in advance

Paul
