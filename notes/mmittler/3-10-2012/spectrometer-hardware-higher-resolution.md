Hello Labbers,

i am working on a microspectrometer hardware with 16Bit resolution approx. 300-700nm & 2nm Resolution. Finally done. I am wondering if it whould be easy to get this piece of hardware engaged with the spectral workbench. Serial Port access within the Software is needed for my Hardware, it doesen't matter if plain RS232 or USB/FTDI & Some Hooks & Hints as well ;-)

Best
Matthias
