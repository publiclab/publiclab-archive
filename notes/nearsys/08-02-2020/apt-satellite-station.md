Great article in receiving APT images. I was able to set up a station and start collecting images. 

As you can see, I have pretty good images and plan to keep collecting them.

Has anyone looked into adding an amplifier to the turnstile antenna prior to the SDR? Could that improve image quality in the extreme north and south of the images?

I assembled an APT station back in 1992 and really loved it. I am glad to see there's an easier way to do it today. Thanks for the article.
