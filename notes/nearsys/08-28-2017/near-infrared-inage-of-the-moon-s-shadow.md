I wanted to see what kind of data I could collect during the solar eclipse.

So I attached a modified Mobius ActionCam to one of my weather balloons and trackers and took pictures every five seconds. The Mobius has a RGB blocking filter and is set for monochrome. This images was recorded at around 45,000 feet.

I need to analyze the thermal infrared images (long wave infrared) next. I can't make heads no tails out of them yet since that camera was not in sync with the NIR camera.

High altitude balloon launch is basically a poor man's space program.
