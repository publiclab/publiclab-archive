# What are the initial steps you take when you begin a new environmental data investigation?

I am developing tools that help people to interpret data about local environmental issues and make scientifically valid arguments about what they learn. The tools will provide an easy-to-use user interface for exploring aggregated, curated data and will allow users to produce reports written in easy to understand language with charts. Users will be able to select the datasets they want to use all within one system that scaffolds data investigations without requiring statistical knowledge. People who use these tools do not need to understand research protocols or statistics in order to create scientifically-valid arguments.

My goal is to work with Public Lab to integrate these tools into Public Lab's website. So I want to know how you all approach data problems.   

I'd like to know about how you start an investigation. For instance, when you start:

- do you know what location you wish to investigate? the issue? the measures you want to use?   
- Do you know what measures are available?
- Do you already have data? Where do you find data? If you collect it, how do you know what to collect?
- Do you know how you will analyze it?
- What's hard about getting started? What's easy?

Thanks for your help!
