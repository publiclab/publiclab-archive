i started to study the water content, LAI, and building a big data for machine learning for forecasting diseases and weather
so far i gather lots of photos that i still need to process

some details on the hardware
raspi with 9 cameras (multiplexed) with 7 filters 1 vis 1 lepton (160x120)
24/7 capble cable driven robot with solar power and SLA battery
3G/wifi ethernet for communicating with the robot
micro climate data harvesting including lux(ir/vis), pressure, humidity, temp.  

some details on the software
registering the images and using the known formulas for NDVI and such
collecting the sensors (light, temp, pressure, humidity) data for farther analasys
teaching the machine learning what healthy plant look like and the opposite
