<strong><I>Level: Intermediate</I></strong>

<strong>Recommended Previous Knowledge:</strong> 
- Highschool physics, esp. Fundamentals of Technical Optics 
- Interpreting of Technical Principles
- ability to abstract from a general sketch to your actual application
- reading of simple technical drawings 
- understanding of the metric system 
- some DIY-skills


<strong>Goal:</strong>
- create an inexpensive DIY-spectrometer 
- 1nm resolution range 
- <10$
- transportable 
- use simplified, interchangeable, easy available parts 
- use existing digital camera
- be adjustable
- find easy way for reproducible calibration

 
<strong><U>Foregoing considerations:</U></strong>

<strong>Most common elements of a Spectrometer:</strong> 
(1) - Slit Diaphragm (with adjustable slit) 
(2) - Pin Diaphragm  
(3) - Prism or Diffraction Grating Film 
(4) - Screen/Lens/Camera 
    - some kind of Casing 

<strong>Resolutions of Common Diffraction Grating Films:</strong>
<pre><strong>CD:</strong>       625 lines/mm
<strong>SADGF:</strong>   1000 lines/mm (Simple Astronomical Diffaction Grating Film)
<strong>DVD:</strong>     1350 lines/mm
<strong>Blu-Ray:</strong> 3125 lines/mm
<strong>HCF:</strong> 200-4000 lines/mm (Holographic Coating Film)</pre> 
 
<strong><U>Main Parts:</U></strong> 
 
<strong>Diffraction Grating Film</strong>

<U>Type choosen for this Project:</U><strong> SADGF</strong> 
<strong>Why?</strong>
- Easy available, inexpensive, easy cuttable or in slide frames premounted, high quality film sheets at around 1$ per spectrometer. 
- Slide Mount make it easy to keep the film flat, change the grating possible and is easy to reposition.
