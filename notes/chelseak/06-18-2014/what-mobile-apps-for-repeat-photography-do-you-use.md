##Collecting Images of a Location
I'm monitoring a stream restoration project and looking for a quick and easy way to collect images of the changes expected to develop over two years. 

I'd ideally like to use a mobile app that helps the photographer line up the image to match a previous shot.  It'd be even better if the app helped organize the photographs and let users know when a photo hadn't been taken in a while. Photographers will likely be the landowners and our undergraduate research team.

Have you used an app like this before? What was it? Have you set up a camera stand? What did you find trickiest about it? 

Suggestions and advice are most appreciated.

_Turns out dairy cows are really interested in streamflow too._


##Information on the Site
A small stream is being fenced off from some grazing dairy cows. The cows like to congregate in the shade of the trees, drink from the stream, and leave behind some phosphorus rich gifts (read: poop). We've noticed they've trampled the banks of this little stream quite a bit and it's likely there is lots of sediment ending up in the stream as well. In addition to the water quality data that we're collecting, we'd like to see how the streambanks change seasonally before and after we put in the fence.

There are several large trees that we could use to frame the image. We've also installed an instrument in the stream to measure flow, which could be used as a reference location. It'd be more ideal to take the picture from the road that crosses the stream just downhill of these pictures.
