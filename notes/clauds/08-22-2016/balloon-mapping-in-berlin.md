###Event details
This coming Thursday, 25 August 2016, at the Zentrum f√ºr Kunst und Urbanistik - [ZKU](http://www.zku-berlin.org/)  at Siemensstrasse 27, Moabit, 10551 Berlin, it is our pleasure to present the balloon mapping project of [Bourj Al Shamali refugee camp in south Lebanon](https://placesjournal.org/article/camp-code/).

Balloon mapping is a low-cost and simple technique to produce high resolution aerial images of an area - a "do-it-yourself satellite imagery" developed and promoted by Public Lab, a citizen-science group. With this imagery, we are currently constructing the first map of the camp created by its inhabitants - a tool we aim to use to create a much-needed public green space in the camp.

[Mustapha Dakhloul](https://publiclab.org/profile/mustafa10), one of the young mappers from Bourj Al Shamali will also be explaining this technique, as we balloon map ZKU at 7pm.
