Within the last few decades,
Indonesia had achieved remarkable progress in water resources development until
the beginning of the year 2000'through intensive implementation of
government-initiated water resources development projects. Nevertheless, the institutional
and organizational issue for sustaining the developed infrastructures has been
lagging behind due to insufficient attention. From the underlined practices, a
number of lessons were learning till the country suffered from a multidimensional
crisis. In fact, it has been recognized that the severe crisis had been due to
the chronic neglect of the farmers 'participation in the routine operation and
maintenance process of the developed water resources and irrigation
infrastructures.

In an attempt to resolve the
dilemmatic situation, while keeping pace with the productivity level with the
increasing population growth, an emphasis has been given to irrigation
development and management based on the participatory approach. The program had been set up to reduce the
central government's burden on O&Mcosts aiming for sustainable irrigated
agricultural productivity through the PIM approach.

For the materialization of the
said program, a number of policy reforms have been enacted on water resources
and irrigated agricultural programs. In line with this policy reform, the PIM
approach has also been significantly implemented. These include among others,
turning over the small scale irrigation schemes with small landholding to the
Water User Association - WUA; Encouragement of irrigation service fee (ISF);
Small schemes Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT); Participatory design and
construction implementation program; "Field laboratories" for the
visual process of "learning by doing" and other such government
initiatives. However, it was experienced that the above attempts have been going
very slowly and as yet least sustainable. This matter has been suspected, among
others, due to the low economic potential of the farmers and farming conditions
under the small scale land ownership. The land ownerships, as a matter of fact,
are already too small and that has been marginalizing the already marginal farmers
'incomes.

To facilitate resolving the
problems, the program was supported by Water Law No. 7/2004, together with the
Government Regulation No. 20/2006 about "irrigation" (that prescribe that
the O & M responsibility for primary and secondary canals belongs to the
Central Government, Provincial as well as Local Autonomous Government with
certain role sharing criteria settled down by the Government Regulation on
irrigation Management. (The Laws and Regulations have been reformulated within
the last few years for reducing the burden of the farmers by assisting to
operate and maintain the tertiary canals and infrastructure which were
previously under the responsibility of the Water User's Associations (WUA).

This paper will discuss the
series of the procedure and empirical processes, as well as problem-solving
from the past experiences on PIM under the small landholding condition. These
Include technical institutional, and financial, as well as regulatory instruments,
and other such measures toward the future enhancement and sustainability of PIM
under the small landholding irrigated agriculture.

After 1900 governments assumed a
lot of influence over irrigation because:

\*
Water was more and more thought of government
property attributable to the increasing demand permanently quality water and
also the reducing convenience

\*
Governments
kicked off giant scale irrigation comes as they were thought of a lot of
economical

\*
The development of recent irrigation schemes
became technically, financially and organizationally thus difficult that they
fell outside the capabilities of the smaller communities

\*
The import and export policies of governments
needed the cultivation of business money crops while, by dominant the water
management, the farmers might be a lot of simply target-hunting to plant these
reasonably crops.

The water management meaning an
outsized grant on irrigation schemes. From 1980 the operation and maintenance
of the many irrigation comes was step by step bimanual over to water user
organizations (WUA's) World Health Organization were to assume these tasks and
an outsized a part of the prices, whereby the water rights of the members had
to be revered.

The exploitation of water
resources via giant storage dams - that always provided wattage similarly - and
diversion weirs commonly remained the responsibility of the government,
principally as a result of environmental protection and questions of safety
were at stake.

In the past, the utility style of
water management witnessed a lot of conflicts and disturbances then the
opposite sorts.
