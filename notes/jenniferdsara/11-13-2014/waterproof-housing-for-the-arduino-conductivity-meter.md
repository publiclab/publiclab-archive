###What I want to do

Using the Arduino Uno, we have made a device that measures temperature and conductivity for water quality monitoring purposes. Our challenge is building a container that will protect the arduino from water damage that is durable and affordable. We hope that our approach can serve others who are also trying to find ways to waterproof their devices.

###My attempt and results
####Materials
[3 in. x 2 ft. PVC Sch. 40 Pipe](http://www.homedepot.com/p/VPC-3-in-x-2-ft-PVC-Sch-40-Pipe-2203/202300524)
[3in. PVC DWV Cap](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Mueller-Streamline-3-in-PVC-DWV-Cap-05979H/205442294)
[3 in. PVC DWV Hub x FIPT Female Adapter](http://www.homedepot.com/p/NIBCO-3-in-PVC-DWV-Hub-x-FIPT-Female-Adapter-C4803HD3/100345631#certona_recommendations)
[3 in. PVC MIPT Cleanout Plug](http://www.homedepot.com/p/NIBCO-3-in-PVC-DWV-MIPT-Cleanout-Plug-C4818HD3/100344824?MERCH=REC-_-PIPHorizontal1_rr-_-NA-_-100344824-_-N)

Solid Rubber Stopper
Stainless Steel Screws 
Purple Primer
PVC cement 


####Steps

#####1. The PVC pipe was cut down to roughly 5 inches. 
#####2. Outlets were made to fit thethermistor and conductivity probes (stainless steel screws) through the [Cleanout Plug](http://www.homedepot.com/p/NIBCO-3-in-PVC-DWV-MIPT-Cleanout-Plug-C4818HD3/100344824?MERCH=REC-_-PIPHorizontal1_rr-_-NA-_-100344824-_-N)

*The hole for the thermistor was made large enough to fit a 1/2 in. x 5/16 in rubber stopper.*

*The thermistor was threaded through the rubber stopper through a whole made with a small drill bit.*

*Testing the thermistor & conductivity probes*



#####3. Putting the parts together

The [3in. PVC DWV Cap](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Mueller-Streamline-3-in-PVC-DWV-Cap-05979H/205442294) and PVC pipe were sealed together using [Purple Primer and PVC Cement](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Oatey-8-oz-PVC-Handy-Pack-Purple-Primer-and-Solvent-Cement-302483/100151579)

You can follow [this easy "how-to" guide](http://www.ehow.com/how_5664571_use-purple-primer-pvc-cement.html) for proper application of the primer and cement. 

For easy access to the arduino hardware, the cap equipped with thermistor and conductivity probe screws on and off. 



###Questions and next steps

To test for water leaks, we have submerged the housing(without the arduino) into a bucket of water for 24 hours. Metal chains were placed inside the housing to keep it underwater.
