We were interested in determining what effect changing certain aspects of the spectrometer kit would have on the quality of our spectra and if other options were viable.  We compared different diffraction gratings (CD versus DVD) as well as light sources (incandescent, halogen and fluorescent).  We found that the prescribed combination of DVD grating with fluorescent light source did provide the best spectra, but that the CD/fluorescent combination also provided adequate results.
The materials we tested included a red tinted blank CD, a blank DVD, a halogen lamp, an incandescent lamp and a compact fluorescent lamp.  The instructions provided on the publiclaboratory website were followed for setup of the spectrometer and preparation of the DVD.  Preparation of the CD involved removing the top red (in our case) reflective layer which the labels are imprinted.  To accomplish this, a combination of removal by tape and scraping was used, and the touching of the disk was avoided to eliminate fingerprint interference.  Areas that were scraped were not selected for the 1 inch square required for the spectrometer grating.  The clearest area of the CD remaining was chosen to avoid interference issues.  No special setup was required for the different light sources, although some adjustments were made for the varying intensities.  The distance between the slit and source was adjusted for each lamp until the intensity was at an appropriate level and as equal as possible to each other.
The relevant difference between the CD and DVD when used as diffraction gratings is the number of lines/mm.  The DVD has about twice as many lines/mm as the CD.  According to nnin.org a DVD has 1350 lines/mm while a CD has only 625 lines/mm.  The greater number of lines on the DVD causes a greater amount of separation of light and thus better resolution.  This also means that the DVD will provide a better spectrum than the CD, however we wondered if the CD would be a viable alternative to the DVD at all. As expected, all of the CD spectra were poorer in quality than the DVD spectra.  However, the incandescent and halogen sources were merely smudges of red.  The fluorescent spectra maintained distinct separation of light.  Although not to the same quality as a DVD/fluorescent combination, the CD/fluorescent combination is an acceptable alternative if a DVD is not readily available.
The second variable in our experiment was the source light.  The difference between incandescent and halogen lamps from fluorescent lamps is the way light is produced.  Incandescent and halogen lamps both produce light through heating of a filament.  Halogen lamps also include one of the halogen elements to help prevent evaporation of the filament.  This also allows the lamp to burn at a higher temperature which can improve the production of a spectrum in the visible region. Both of these lamps produce a continuum spectrum. Fluorescent lights work differently.  Instead of using a heated filament to produce light a fluorescent light works by exciting mercury atoms via electricity.  A phosphor is then used to produce a visible light spectrum.   Because of this unique setup fluorescent lights produce both a line and continuum spectrum.  There are sharp lines produced by the mercury and a continuum from the phosphor.  The fluorescent spectrum for both the CD and DVD gratings was the sharpest and clearest of the three.  This is probably due to the presence of the sharper mercury lines coming from the source.  There was no noticeable difference in quality between the halogen and incandescent lamps.
