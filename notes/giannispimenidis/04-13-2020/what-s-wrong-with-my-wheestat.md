I recently got a wheestat from public lab, version wheestat 5\. I am getting strange readings. I have posted a cv diagram. I get the same diagram whatever solution or electrodes i use (at this volts). Also, at the voltage limits the

negative--\>positive and the positive--\>negative, as shown. I have tried every other aspect of the mode bar and everything is strange. I tried different versions of the software and again the same diagrams. I have checked the continuity of the electrodes and it is ok.  What may be the problem? ![image description](/i/39028.jpg "cv.jpg")
