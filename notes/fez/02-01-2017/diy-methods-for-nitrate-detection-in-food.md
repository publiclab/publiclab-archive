i am working on a citizen science project aimed at carrying out many indipendent measures (quantitative and qualitative) of food quality.
Among them, nitrate and nitrite as they are frequently used also as fertilizers.

The project is still at a very preliminar stage and we are investigating low cost, open source and out-of-the-lab methods to screen for food contaminants and residues (preservatives and pests as well).

Any hint or suggestion is immensely appreciated.
