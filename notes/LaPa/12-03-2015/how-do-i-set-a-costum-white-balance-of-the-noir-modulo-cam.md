###What I want to do
I'm an agronomist, I'm going to make a IR RaspiCam to do an  IR Timelapse in greenhouse. I want add same sensors (temperature, moisture, soil moisture) at the IR Raspicam in order to link environmental condition to Health of the plant.

###My attempt and results
I just took some (BAD) pictures as IR test

###Questions and next steps
Hi! I'm going to take same IR pictures by NoIR modulo cam and blue filter (Roscolux #2007: Storaro Blue) in order to measure the health of plants. To take a Picture I'm using "Raspistill". According to this information   https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/08-15-2013/white-balancing-a-canon-camera-for-infragram-photography I need to set white balance pointing a deep blue surface before take a IR picture of the plants. 
I didn't find any custom white balance command in the list of commands of Raspistill. 
How do I set a custom white balance? 


Thanks in advance

best regards
###Why I'm interested
1) Learn more about IR Images of the plants
2) to identify by IR Images of the plants best of growing condition or the moments of the worst health of the plants during their growth 
3) to use IR Raspicam on aerostatic baloon
