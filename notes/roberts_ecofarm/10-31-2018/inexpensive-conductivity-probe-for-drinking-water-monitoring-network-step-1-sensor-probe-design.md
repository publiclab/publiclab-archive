Here are some sketches for a couple of probes I'm going to test. I'm planning on housing the probe in a three inch PVC elbow because that will be easy to attach to the domestic plumbing between the well and any water treatment. The same probe housing should be usable in springs and streams to monitor surface water.

Feedback or ideas around probe geometry is appreciated.

  
(Revised... I left out the Temperature sensor on the original drawings)![image description](/i/27483.jpg "Probe_Housing.jpg")![image description](/i/27487.jpg "2_post_probe.jpg")![image description](/i/27488.jpg "4_post_probe.jpg")
