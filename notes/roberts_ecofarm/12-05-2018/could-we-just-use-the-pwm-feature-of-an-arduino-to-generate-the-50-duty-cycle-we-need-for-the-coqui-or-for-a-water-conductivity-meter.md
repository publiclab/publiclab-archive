# Could we just use the PWM feature of an Arduino to generate the 50% duty cycle we need for the Coqui or for a water conductivity meter?

Still working on a low cost conductivity sensor/data logger. Was writing code for my Arduino Uno the other day and got reminded of the PWM feature while looking at information on different pins. This [article from NYU](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/microcontrollers/analog-output/) reminded me of donblair's post about 555 timers and [duty cycles](https://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/09-18-2014/duty-cycles-555s-linearity).

Anyone have any experience with this or thoughts on the feasibility?
