Hello @warren, @liz (and everyone else!),

  
I've received quite a lot of feedback about users finding it difficult to keep track of projects in their area (either area of interest or the actual physical location). Since the current /projects page is quite empty, I was thinking we could add a meetup.com style page for keeping track of projects and events.

  
I've combined projects and events under one single page - because I think they are connected (they are both about interacting with others).

  
The projects page would feature a map of my area - with pins for activity near me. 

  
I could also see the projects that I currently follow (so I wouldn't miss any updates), and there would also be a suggestion engine for recommending me projects with activity near me. 

  
I would like to see how many other users are involved in the project. I would also like to see the tags for each project, so I could quickly interpret what a project is about and decide whether I want to join the project.

  
By default, I would like to see projects in my location. If I haven't shared my location yet, there would be a prompt for me to do so.

  
It would be easy and straightforward to add a new project.

  
Perhaps I would also like a quick way of creating an event from the projects page (i.e. quickly organize an event about my project).

Instead of the default "project" view, I could choose to click on the "events" tab.

The events page would feature a calendar. I could RSVP to an event and this would be added to my calendar (and synchronized with my calendar manager - e.g. Google calendar). By default, we could add all online events and encourage users to add events happening in their area (we could add specific tags for "OpenCall", "barnraising", "workshop" etc). I could see how many people are currently going to the event and it would be easy for me to RSVP (or change my RSVP).

  
I know there currently already is an /events page, however, this one (under the /projects page) would have much less information, it would be geared towards RSVP-ing and keeping track of things in my calendar. We could obviously link to the main /events page, so users could get more detailed information there.

  
Let me know what you think :)

  
Thank you!
