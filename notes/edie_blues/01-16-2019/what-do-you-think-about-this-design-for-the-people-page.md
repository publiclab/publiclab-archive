# What do you think about this design for the /people page?

******

Hello! :) 

  
I've started thinking about better ways of organizing the **/people page.**

  
I've come up with two designs. Both of them feature **"people to follow"** (instead of just listing a massive table of all the users of Public Lab). 

  
There is just too much content out there and I think we should focus on getting the right information to the user.

  
The main goal of the /people page, I believe, is to **encourage people to follow user's that would be of interest to them and to interact with them.**

  
The easiest way of recommending users would be by the tags that I'm currently following (we could also feature some users - the leadership team and the most active contributors perhaps).

  
The **first design** gives out more user information at a glance: the number of contributions, the number of followers, as well as the tags followed. This gives a really quick snapshot of the user's activity (making it easy to decide whether I want to follow them or not).

The **second design** is slightly more focused on the user's location. You can lookup users by location (dropdown menu with the list of "active" countries). Of course, there's also the option to search all users. You can join a chat and talk to the people that are currently online. 

  
Instead of contributor stats, we could share a one-sentence bio and the current location (maybe even add a nice flag icon next to the name) - again, encouraging users to connect by location and also encouraging everyone to fill out their profiles.

Which design do you prefer? Why? Is there anything you would like me to add?

  
Let me know :)
