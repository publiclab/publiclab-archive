Desktop spectrometry 3.0 kit: Can it quantify/identify a mixture of ethanol, methanol, KHCO3 etc. 

I am looking to analyze our sample which is a potential  mixture of ethanol, methanol, acetone, KHCO3 etc. Now, I do not know for sure if our mixture contains these components.  Hence, I was wondering if someone has tried this kit and can detect what all is present in our sample? So far this sample is like an unknown sample to me. The sample is clear in color. 

Thanks
