## About me

_My name is Aayush Gupta. I am a programmer and a web developer. I code
in Ruby. I am a third year computer science student in Manipal Institute
of Technology, Manipal. I have been working with this code for 4-5 months now
and quite know it well now._

**Affiliation** Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal

Location: Manipal, India

## Project description

\_I plan on upgrading the plots code from Rails 3 to Rails 4.2 or Rails 5( if permitted )\_

### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

\_In my project I plan to upgrade the PLOTS code from Raills 3 to Rails 4/5.\_

### Problem

\_Currently plots code is running on Rails 3 whereas newer and better versions such as Rails 4.2.8 and Rails 5 have been released. I intend to upgrade the code to Rails 5 which has better performance. It has many benefits such as better performance and support for Ruby \>= 2.2.2.\_

### Timeline/milestones

_Break your project up into small projects -- one per week!_

### Needs

\_No seperate resources would be needed as such. I would just need some guidance from my mentor.\_

### Setup

\_Have you forked the relevant codebases?

Yes, I have forked it and keep on updating from the master on a regular basis.

Link: [https://github.com/aayushgupta1/plots2](https://github.com/aayushgupta1/plots2)

Installed them in a dev environment such as [Cloud9.io](http://Cloud9.io)?

I installed and run the server locally on my laptop.\_

---------

### Experience:

\_I learned coding in my high school and got an interest in it since then. Since then I am in to coding. Started on C++ to Python and currently on Ruby.

Have you looked over our welcome page and are you familiar with how to make your first contribution? Have you already?\_

\_Yes, I have my first contribution. Rather, I have made some significant contributions to the plots code in the past.\_

---------

### Teamwork:

\_I have done an internship in L&T in the automation department (closed source) where I worked in a team of 10 people. Did some automation for some processes using python and some tools that they use within the company. I liked working with the team as they were eager to help and taught me a lot.

I have worked on github for several of my projects that I did for my college and school as a developer.

I am driven by a eagerness to learn and implement whatever I learn. I like to implement my knowledge in the real world and make a change.\_

---------

### Passion

\_I like to use my knowledge in the real world and make a change. \_So, I don't leave an opportunity to make a change. As you are making the world a better place to be in, I would like to make a my contribution to it. I like the work you do and would help you do it.\_

### Commitment:

_As I am a student, I am free during the summer for 3 months. I will dedicate my time for this and do whatever it takes to complete this project. I would take it as a full time job._
