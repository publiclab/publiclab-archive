I wanted to put my water filter up to a test. Two identical transparent bottles were filled with tap water, one bottle with filtered tap H2O and the other unfiltered tap H2O. Two tests were taken to make sure the results were conclusive and in both tests all parameters were exactly the same except for camera shutter speed.

Location: Sweden

Camera: Canon IXUS 120 IR filter removed, ISO 80

Slit width: 0.08mm

Distance from slit to grating: 30 cm

Distance from grating to camera lens: 3mm

Illumination: Warm white IKEA LED

Filter: Espring (carbon + UV)


**Test # 1 **

Camera shutter speed 8 sec

**Test # 2 **

Camera shutter speed 16 sec

**Unfiltered tap H2O spectral image**

..................................................................................................................................................................

**Result**: In each test the graph for filtered H2O peaked higher than the graph for unfiltered H2O

**Conclusion** The filtered H20 is more transparent due to less contamination, therefore peaking higher then the more contaminated unfiltered H2O. The filter is working!
