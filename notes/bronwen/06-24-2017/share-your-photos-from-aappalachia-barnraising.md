Barnraisers! We would love to see your photos from this weekend's Barnraising in West Virgina. Images from your sessions, notes you've taken, pictures or charts you drew, tools you tinkered with, balloons you flew, or anything else: add them to this post by dropping them into the comments below.

If you are posting Barnraising photos on social media, please tag us at @PublicLab and #BarnraisingWV2017

Thanks!
