Thanks to the 357 supporters of our recent Kickstarter campaign, the Community Microscope will soon be shipping to community scientists, environmental investigators and advocates, teachers and learners, artists, makers, and lots of other folks who got involved with making this project happen.

Over the course of this campaign we were lucky to work with people from within the Public Lab community who chimed in to offer suggestions, support, criticism and refinements. Everyone's work and care for this project has given us the chance to introduce new people to our work-- though events at two different Maker Faires (Bay Area and Providence), a workshop at the Nueva School, and through lots of social media and real-life conversations with people who are getting excited about the world of possibilities available to them with open source tools.

We wanted to thank everyone who made this possible, in full open source spirit -

1. Our collaborators in Wisconsin[https://publiclab.org/tag/wisconsin](https://publiclab.org/tag/wisconsin)
2. the Hackteria network[http://www.hackteria.org/](http://www.hackteria.org/)
3. Lifepatch in Indonesia[https://www.lifepatch.org/](https://www.lifepatch.org/)
4. Max Liboiron and the CLEAR lab[https://civiclaboratory.nl/](https://civiclaboratory.nl/)
5. Parts & Crafts[https://partsandcrafts.org](https://partsandcrafts.org)
6. WaterScope[http://www.waterscope.org/](http://www.waterscope.org/) and the Open Flexure Microscope team[https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure\_microscope](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope)
7. Our Google Summer of Code fellow MaggPi[https://publiclab.org/profile/maggpi](https://publiclab.org/profile/maggpi)
8. And so many more!

We're already starting work to get the Early Bird kits shipped; stay tuned on Twitter and Instagram to see our progress, and get ready to #RemixTheMicroscope!

Keep your eyes open for more documentation and activities going up on the Community Microscope page on Public Lab's website in the coming weeks and months as this project continues to grow!
