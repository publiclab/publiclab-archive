On Sunday September 23, Public Lab had the opportunity to lead a 
hands-on microscope workshop for 30 people of all ages at NYC Maker 
Faire. We worked with the most basic USB webcam version of our kit, and 
had some great success locating microorganisms in samples of pond water 
from the Prospect Park lake in Brooklyn, NYC. We were especially excited
to hear about some of the research plans that workshop attendees had 
for their new microscopes, and look forward to hearing from some new 
microscope enthusiasts.   

  
We had invaluable hands-on support from @Eymund who was able to 
help frame some questions about the microbiomes of NYC's waterways, and 
Jay Holmes, who brought one of his own handmade microscopes ([you can see it here](https://cryptolithusblog.wordpress.com/2014/11/02/the-scope-a-coralline-and-darwin/)) who was able to step in with some extremely useful microscope expertise.   

  
We'll
be sharing some of the questions that came up during this session in 
other research notes, and are looking forward to hosting another 
microscope meetup sometime this fall to continue experimenting with the 
kit's design and discuss how we might use it for environmental research 
in and around NYC, so stay tuned if you're interested in joining us!
