On Sat, Dec 15, we'll be offering a DIY Community Microscope workshop at[Fat Cat Fab Lab. ](https://www.fatcatfablab.org/)  

  
**Join us from 2:00-3:30 for a hands-on microscope building session! **We'll be constructing the basic webcam microscope and learning how to prep, focus and photograph our samples. If you would prefer to assemble a different variant of the kit, please email [kits@publiclab.org](mailto:kits@publiclab.org) by Monday, Dec 10 to confirm availability. 

  
Registration info and signup can be found on our [E](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/diy-community-microscopes-with-public-lab-tickets-53302999707?aff=efbeventtix&fbclid=IwAR3BZQpXf-YhoKlPi7hH_kD4Gzi2AbAvPoWSHjk9Fa5LtZHKgGRbfZUFK58)[ventbrite listing](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/diy-community-microscopes-with-public-lab-tickets-53302999707?aff=efbeventtix&fbclid=IwAR3BZQpXf-YhoKlPi7hH_kD4Gzi2AbAvPoWSHjk9Fa5LtZHKgGRbfZUFK58).  
  
The workshop itself is free, but **if you wish to assemble a microscope kit you may purchase one \*at the event\*** by RSVPing with the first ticket option. If you already have one of our Community Microscope Kits, plan to source your own components, or simply want to observe, you can RSVP with the second ticket option. 

  
We'll provide samples to look at on slides, but welcome you to bring samples of your own and we'll try to make identifications!  

  
**From 3:30-5:00 (and possibly beyond!) we'll be lingering in the space for a microscope social**-- if you just want to drop by to say hello, experiment with some of our kits, or plan for future microscope projects in NYC and beyond, you don't need to register at all! Just drop me a line to let me know you're coming. 

  
Hope to see some of you soon!

  
What's in our NYC park water?
