As we get ready for this July's Barnraising and Crisis Convening, I'm wondering what kinds of tools people have found valuable to have on hand in the hours, days and weeks after a crisis or emergency: specifically one where there is an urgent need to respond to or document environmental threats.   

  
Obviously the tools folks might use in a response would vary depending on the nature of the emergency and the place where it's unfolding, but I'm curious: what kinds of things have been of most use to folks who have first-hand experience in crisis events? What would you NOT recommend? In retrospect, are there things that you wish you had had with you?
