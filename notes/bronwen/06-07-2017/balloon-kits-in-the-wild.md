We're putting out a call for photos, videos, sketches, fax printouts, clay impressions: any kind of images you have of our aerial mapping kit boxes out in the wild! Does your Balloon mapping kit box moonlight as a bento box or the case for a pirate radio station? We would be excited to see that too! Maybe even extra excited.

We're working towards some exciting expansions of our store and kits offerings, and would love to be able to share pictures of Public Lab community members (and Public Lab stuff) representing our tools in the world.

If you have something that fits the bill, please add it to the comments below. And if you have some great aerial-mapping photos that \*don't\* show a box, we'd still love to see them [on this research note](https://publiclab.org/notes/bronwen/06-05-2017/calling-for-your-favorite-kite-balloon-mapping-images-and-video). Thanks, all!
