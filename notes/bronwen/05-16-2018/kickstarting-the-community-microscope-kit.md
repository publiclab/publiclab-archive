We're excited to have launched a new Kickstarter campaign for the Community Microscope Kit, a low-cost, open source microscope that can be built in minutes and connect to a smartphone or computer. We encourage you to visit its [crowdfunding page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/the-community-microscope-kit?ref=category_recommended&ref=discovery) over at Kickstarter, and join other members of Public Lab in helping to evolve this project by adding your own questions, projects, modifications, activities, and research to our growing set of resources on the [Microscope Wiki Page](https://publiclab.org/wiki/microscopes).   
  
This kit is based on [the Hackteria microscope](https://publiclab.org/notes/partsandcrafts/10-26-2017/making-a-hackteria-microscope), the OpenFlexure Microscope, and @maxliboiron's work at [http://CivicLaboratory.nl](http://CivicLaboratory.nl) (among other sources) and was developed in partnership with [Parts & Crafts](https://www.partsandcrafts.org/), and more recently 
in collaboration with numerous other members of the Public Lab community.   
  
We're tremendously excited about expanding Public Lab's toolkits to include DIY microscopes, and are looking forward to seeing the ways this can support research and discovery in the community.   
  
Do you have an idea for a new kit? Connect with the [Kits Initiative](https://publiclab.org/wiki/kits) to learn more about ways to bring new tools to Public Lab.
