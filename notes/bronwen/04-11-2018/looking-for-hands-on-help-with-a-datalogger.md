Hello! I was wondering if there was anyone working on datalogging who might be interested in hopping in to try to get a portable HCHO meter connected to any of the dataloggers (Riffles, Mini-Pearls, Arduinos, Mayfly, Knowflow, and others) currently in-use in various Public Lab (and Public Lab-adjacent) projects? You can read more about the ask here: [What Datalogger Will Wowk With My Portable HCHO Meter](https://publiclab.org/questions/nshapiro/03-27-2018/what-data-logger-will-work-with-my-portable-hcho-meter).

This particular project has a quick turnaround time, so we're ESPECIALLY interested in folks who can either assist with hands-on troubleshooting, or consult by offering some step-by-step instructions or activities that people who are reasonably new to working with arduino or dataloggers can follow (this will benefit future projects as well). 

Thanks for considering!
