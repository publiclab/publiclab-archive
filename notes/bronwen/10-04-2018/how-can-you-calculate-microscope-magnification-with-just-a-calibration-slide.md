We've been learning a lot with the Community Microscopes, and was wondering if anyone could point us to a formula for calculating magnification WITHOUT knowing the specific magnification of the lens-- In the webcam version of the kit we're using an inverted webcam lens, but since the lenses themselves are flipped and moved and re-positioned in relation to the sensor, I'm not sure the original camera specs can help us.   

  
We CAN measure the field of view with a calibration slide, but extrapolating that out to the size of the screen it's displayed on or a digital image produces dubious and inconsistent results.

  
Does anyone have a formula that might work here? For reference, the calibration slide looks like this:![image description](/i/26763.jpg "Photo_on_9-30-18_at_11.45_AM.jpg")

  
and an organism used with the same setup looks like this:

We can obviously determine the size of what we're looking at, but am unsure what to say when people ask about the magnification we're using. Any thoughts?
