I never really knew much about spectrometers (and still don't) but I happened on a [summary](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/420214/the-danger-of-green-laser-pointers/) of an article about green laser pointers which mentioned that a number of green laser pointers emit dangerous amounts of infrared at double the frequency of the laser -- in my case, presumably at 1064 nm.  I was curious if my laser pointer fell into that category, and am still trying to figure out a cost effective way to see if the laser is emitting in the near IR spectrum. I have no real reason for this project, other than to satisfy my curiosity.

I built the cell-phone mounted paper spectrometer (and was able to confirm that I have a 532 nm laser), but based on failed attempts to catch a spectrum of an infrared LED I'm pretty sure my phone's camera isn't sensitive at infrared wavelengths.  Does anyone have suggestions on a camera that would be sensitive to ~1100nm, or perhaps an alternative suggestion on how to figure out if the laser pointer is emitting at that frequency?

Thanks in advance!
