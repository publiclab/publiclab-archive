During the Citizen Scientist on the Move conference in Amsterdam on June 27th we experimented with kite satellite image mapping. We combined the photo camera with a Sensepod developed by Sensaris. Interesting stuff! At an altitude of approx 400 meters we did air quality measurements using the Sensepod and also shot some interesting photo imagery.

Since the Bluetooth connection with the Sensepod was limited to 300 meters we were still able to get some interesting data showing a dramatic drop of the air quality when the kite increased altitude
