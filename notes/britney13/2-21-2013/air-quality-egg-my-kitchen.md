As you can see in the first picture, I located my egg in the kitchen. I decided to put it in the kitchen because when we cook the water vapor turns into humidity and so it makes the kitchen have a different humidity than in my room. In addition, In the second picture, as you can see those are the things surrounded the air quality egg. There is a oven, the stove and a blender. And the last picture, I took it in the night.
I had a challenge installing the air quality egg.My challenge challenges was figuring out where to put the air quality egg in the kitchen. I knew once I plug it in, nobody can not touch it anymore and so I had to find a place where I knew nobody was going to touch it, so I decided to put it in there.
I observe that the air quality egg gets red once in a while, and it starts to make a louder noise when you touch it or touch the cord. I also noticed that when someone tried to use the blender or the oven or anything that was connected in the same outlet, the air quality egg, the egg would run faster.
