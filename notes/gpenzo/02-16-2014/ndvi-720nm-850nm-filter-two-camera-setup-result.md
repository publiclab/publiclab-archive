###What I want to do
I made a simple test two day with my canon [two camera setup](http://publiclab.org/notes/gpenzo/02-09-2014/nvdi-with-canon-a2500).
Canon 2500 running chdk. 
Im made two pictures with 720 and 850 nm (easy to find). All the exposure stuff I left two the cameras.
Nothing has been changed from default. Cameras are set to produce raw data.
Histogram are made with gimp.
I was a bit supprised of the 805nm filter. Did not expect that much blue

###My attempt and results
**Visble 720 nm shot**

**Visble 850 nm shot**

**720NM histogram, notice the same red and blue profile!!**

**850NM histogram, notice the blue and red overlay!!**

**850NM NDVI **

###Questions
I expected to see more red with the 850NM. But it seems like the red channel and blue channel are both sensitive to IR. Even with the 720nm you can see that red and blue have the same profile. Only more red. Is my assumption correct. Can anyone explain this??

Based on the result it looks like the 850NM gives better result. Look at the road next to the sign.
In 850NM you see more details. Also the whole picture is shifted more to the right on the NDVI scale.

What do you guys, girls think.
