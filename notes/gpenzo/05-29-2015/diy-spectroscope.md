###What I want to do
I had some usb camera and some lenses laying around from a previous project.
And thought how easy can I make a spectroscope with it, without to much work.

###My attempt and results
I bought a cheap jewelry spectroscope and attach the usb camera to it with hot glue.
The NIR filter of the usb camera is removed. Hoping it will be more sensitive at the red band.
I use a 3.6mm Lens

The result is very nice. Still need to adjust the focus a bit.

The with line on the right should not be there. I think the grating plate in side the tube is not fit correctly.
Also I do not understand why it is getting a bit blue on the left side.
But he it was a cheap scope.

###Why I'm interested
I just did it for fun.
Want to see how easy it is to make a cheap spectroscope with stuff I had laying around.
Cheap but still good spectral images.
All it need is a 3D printed enclosure.
