###What I want to do
My goal is to make nvdi images of farmland. Hopefully the quality will be good enough to help farmers locate plant stress in the field. I think the best quality NDVI images will be made with two cameras.
I'm using two canon a2500 cameras. The reason for a2500: the cheapiest canon camera i could buy.

###My attempt and results
Usual steps for the camera remove: IR filter.
It is difficult to get a watter 85A filter arround here. So I use a massa 850 nm IR filter.

Original Visible picture:

The result looks good even I had to hold the two cameras in my hand,
these pictures are not with the rig below.

Setup of two cameras.

###Questions and next steps
These pictures where taken without changing any exposure setting ofthe camera. For now chdk was only installed for the raw camera capability.
I'm wondering if I should take pictured with shutter speed and focal lenght locked for both camera. 
Or should I leave the cameras to decide what to do by them self.







Next steps:
+ test with 750 nm IR filter
+ test with locked shutter speed and focallenght for both camera using chdk
+ Modify my bixler2 drone to support both cameras with battery.

###Why I'm interested
Our most important daily life thing is food and water. I think we need to find ways to help farmers get the best yeild they can while using resources where they are needed, water , firtilizer, pesticide.
If you look how much area a farmer needs to cover,  a bit of help is needed.
