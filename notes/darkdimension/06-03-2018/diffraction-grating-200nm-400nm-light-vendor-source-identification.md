Piecing together a DIY spectrometer and sourcing: diffraction grating (200nm - 400nm) and the appropriate light source. The target wavelengths are roughly: 220nm, 230nm, 250nm, 270nm and 280nm  

  
I have located the recommended software to perform remote analysis (https://github.com/classimago/Pi-Spectrometer/tree/master).

  
This spectrometer would be used inline with a batch and possible continuous process.

  
Are there any vendors/sources for the proper diffraction grating?

  
What light source is recommended (Vendor/Source)?

  
The DIY equipment will display the wavelength that is absorbed as a black band. Is there a better way to approach this?  

  
Thank you all for your help
