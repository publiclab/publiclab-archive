This is to be used as a regularly updated post where I post links to new papers I think are of interest to the community.

## Generic

[A review paper on different tasks where smartphones were used for science (microscopy, colorimetry etc.)](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2018/an/c8an01269e) 

## Colorimetry
[Colorimetry in Chemical Analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1061934818110060) - Shows a large set of example on the kind of tests performed using colorimetry.

## Microscopy

[Low cost digital holographic microscope for 3-D cell imaging by integrating smartphone and DVD optical head](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143816618307814) - Paywall. This group have taken an imaging head from a DVD-player and used it to generate a 2 beam holographic microscope. While this might be a low cost setup I would guess that assembling it would be challenging.

[A low-cost do-it-yourself microscope kit for hands-on science education](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10741/107410K/A-low-cost-do-it-yourself-microscope-kit-for-hands/10.1117/12.2320655.full) - open access, contains video presentation. This paper describes the work of the BioBus, a nonprofit organization for science outreach and education based in New York City ([www.biobus.org](http://www.biobus.org)). they have used a benchtop microscope to engage and educate. The paper shows some matrices of engagements by the children.

[Deep learning improves mobile-phone microscopy (Conference Presentation)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10772/107720Q/Deep-learning-improves-mobile-phone-microscopy-Conference-Presentation/10.1117/12.2320864.short) - not open, contains video presentation. This is a summary of several publications by the Ozcan group out of UCLA who are doing some very impressive work, [see more here](https://samueli.ucla.edu/deep-learning-transforms-smartphone-microscopes-into-laboratory-grade-devices/).

[Smartphone-based low-cost microscope with monolithic focusing mechanism ](https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/cdbme.2018.4.issue-1/cdbme-2018-0065/cdbme-2018-0065.pdf) - open access, describes the design of a single piece to hold and manipulate a phone (they made a mold that resembles plastic model aircraft look out of the box).
