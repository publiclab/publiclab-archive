With the further improvement of living standards and science and technology, people have become more and more aware of the close relationship between indoor air quality and people's physical health, and pay more attention to indoor air quality.

People usually live, work, study or other aspects, 80% of the time is indoors, the air he is exposed to is mainly indoor air; a person has to breathe more than 20,000 times a day, and exchange at least 10,000 with the environment every day More liters of gas, it can be seen that if the indoor air is polluted, it will cause great harm to human health.![image description](/i/45305.png "air_quality_sensor.png")

  
There are currently five main hazards and indicators of indoor pollutants

Radon gas: exists in the cement, ballast bricks and decorative stones of buildings. The standard for new houses is that the standard for new houses is less than 100 Bq/m3, and the standard for new houses is less than 200 Bq/m3\. The main hazard of radon to humans is lung cancer, which is the second leading cause of lung cancer besides smoking.

Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde mainly comes from man-made panels and is confirmed as a suspicious carcinogen by the WHO, which mainly affects the respiratory system. It is stipulated that the maximum allowable concentration of formaldehyde in the room air is 0.08 mg/m3\. The indoor standard set by the Ministry of Health and Construction is still 0.08 mg/m3\. But for public buildings and other buildings, 0.12 mg/m3 is required.

Ammonia: Indoor ammonia mainly comes from concrete antifreeze. The main hazards of ammonia to the human body are irritation and damage to the respiratory tract, eye mucous membrane and skin. According to the indoor environmental pollution control standards for civil construction engineering, the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in indoor air is less than 0.2 mg per cubic meter.

Benzene: Paints, adhesives and various interior wall coatings contain benzene, toluene and xylene. The World Health Organization believes that benzene is a carcinogen, which can easily cause damage to the human body's hematopoietic function. The standard of indoor air benzene series is less than 0.09 mg per cubic meter.

All volatile organic compounds (TVOC) in the atmosphere: Broadly speaking, any organic compound that naturally volatilizes from liquid or solid indoors at room temperature and pressure belongs to the category of TVOC. TVOC, as a heterogeneous pollutant in indoor air, is extremely Complex, and new types are constantly being synthesized. In addition to aldehydes, benzene, toluene, xylene, trichloroethylene, chloroform, naphthalene, diisocyanate, etc. are common in TVOC. These substances mainly come from various coatings, adhesives and various man-made materials. The limit of the TVOC concentration in indoor air is no more than 500 mg/m3 for class I civil construction projects, and no more than 600 mg/m3 for class I civil construction projects.

In order to facilitate the understanding of indoor air quality, more and more people use indoor AQI sensors to monitor the concentration of different gases in the air to protect people's health.

With the advancement of intelligent construction, it seems that the problem of indoor air quality control is not just a "pure detection" project. At present, there are a wide variety of air detection equipment on the market, with specialized instruments such as [PM2.5 sensors](https://www.renkeer.com/product/pm-sensor/), nitrogen oxide analyzers, formaldehyde detectors, etc., as well as [AQI sensors](https://www.renkeer.com/product/aqi-sensor/ "https://www.renkeer.com/product/aqi-sensor/") that integrate all air quality elements. Satisfy multiple market needs such as testing, monitoring, and monitoring.

The accuracy and performance requirements of the monitoring instrument are higher, and it can quickly and accurately detect the content of the main pollutants in the indoor air; it has an automated, intelligent, and networked interactive page, which has stronger data management capabilities, analysis capabilities, and decision-making capabilities; indoor air purification Higher efficiency, but also should have innovative points such as power consumption monitoring, convenience and efficiency, and intelligent linkage.
