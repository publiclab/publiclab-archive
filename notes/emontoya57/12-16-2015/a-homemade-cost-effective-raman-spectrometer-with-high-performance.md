###What I want to do

A DIY low cost high performance Raman spectrometer.

###My attempt and results

After about two years of trials finally succeded. A detailed paper entitled: "A Homemade Cost Effective Raman Spectrometer with High Performance" has been just published in the open access "Journal of Laboratory Chemical Education", available at: http://www.sapub.org/Journal/articles.aspx?journalid=1139.

I hope it has useful information for some of you. After the trials, a device can be made in short time. The picture shows an example of the obtained Raman spectrum for benzene and an internal view of the device.

###Questions and next steps


Please do not hesitate in contact to me for further discussions.

###Why I'm interested

It could be a long story. In brief, when student (very long time ago) i was very frustrated because the laboratory had an old fashioned Beckman DB spectrometer in bad condition and for wished to make my own spectrometer. my first one (using a piece od DVD, a webcam a cheap fiber optic patch cord and slit made with pieces of razor blade) worked good by 2009. Few years later I found this nice Group and tried few small contributions.

As a chemist I am very intersted in optical spectroscopy and particularly in what I call "Alternative Scientific Instrumentation" which denotes high performance instrumentation made at low cost because it relies on the use of components of high technology with a worldwide availability and massive consumer market.
