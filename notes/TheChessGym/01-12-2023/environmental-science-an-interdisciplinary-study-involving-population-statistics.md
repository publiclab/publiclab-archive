Environmental Science is an interdisciplinary study that is comprised of the study and research of a plethora of other fields of science such as Geology, Psychology, Ecology, and Sociology to name a few. Population is another area of study that is essential to the study of the particulars regarding world population size, deaths, and numbers of individuals who have no access to a safe water drinking resource. Environmental Science is a enterprising study that will force individuals to take note of various factors that affect our environment.  My students are looking forward to this learning adventure.
