Microplastic Intrusion To The Great Lakes

Today, I watched a video on Microplastics in the great lakes. The Great Lakes are Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, Lake Ontario and Lake Superior. The amazing surprise to me revolved around the lakes comprising the largest source of the world's fresh water. Additionally, the Great Lakes also represent approximately 84% of the surface fresh water for the entire United States of America. Despite the fact that 3/4 of the earth's surface is water, only 3% of the earth's water is fresh water! Fresh water is vital to the ecosystem and function of a host of living organisms and species. Thus the preservation, maintenance, and cultivation of this limited and vital resource is paramount. 

The video indicated that studies and samples taken from the Great Lakes have revealed an array of microplastic pollution present in these valuable water resources. Estimates show that several million tons of microplastic pollution have all ready made their way into the Lakes surface waters and basin floors. Studies show that the only plausible solution is to start by reducing the production and use of plastics period. Microplastics have been ingested, by tiny living organisms some of which will be eaten by humans. Microplastic exposure to humans can be through, our air, soil, and yes----even our water! The striking facts to this dilemma can be found on the link below.
