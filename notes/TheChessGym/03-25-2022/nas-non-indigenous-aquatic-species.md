The Environmental Protection Agency also provides a myriad of topics concerning waterways revealing their quality, size, and species (indigenous and non-indigenous) species that inhabit them. The NAS (Non-indigenous Aquatic Species) depicts all of aquatic species that are indigenous (native) and non-indigenous (non-native) in the U.S. bodies of water that can be researched by state. Thus every State in the U.S. can be referenced and researched according to specific aquatic organisms that inhabit them with specificity as to whether they are native or non-indigenous to that body of water and region. The NAS also presents data specific to aquatic plants that are native and non-native to different waterways specific to each state. The largest contribution is the information presented about the adverse effects non-indigenous species have on the individual ecosystems they invade. 

The Rio-Grande Cichlid is an invasive non-indigenous species of fish that has been introduced into Louisiana Fresh water systems. The fish has had a huge adverse effect on the Louisiana Fresh water fishing industry. The invasive Rio Grande Cichlid has an insatiable appetite for fish eggs and has single-handedly reduced the population of several Louisiana "Game" fish such as Perch, Bass, and Catfish. The Rio Grande has made the Louisiana Fishing and Game List of Harmful Invasive Species. The E. P. A. has established through the detection, study, and release of this kind of data as comprehensive attempt to preserve, and cultivate water quality and environment preservation on a multiplicity of levels. Microplastic plastic pollution detection experiments is simply one rung in a multi-faceted attempt to improve, conserve, maintain, and  preserve our waters.
