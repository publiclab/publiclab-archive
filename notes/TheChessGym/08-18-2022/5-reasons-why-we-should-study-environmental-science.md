The title depicts a very passionate, interesting, and informative promotion for the study of Environmental Science. The presenter revealed 5 relevant ideals denoting the importance of this critical science as a field of study. Amid our increasing population (approaching 8 billion people on earth) and waning natural resources, there are legitimate concerns about the future of our planet and its ability to sustain life. The video also captivates the viewer's awareness to how vast and multi-faceted the study of our environment along with its constant changes which directly affect everyone. The air we breathe, the water we drink, the soil we grow our food and even the food we consume, are all affected by our changing environment.
