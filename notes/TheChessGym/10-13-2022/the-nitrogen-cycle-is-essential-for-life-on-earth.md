The Nitrogen Cycle Is Essential For Life On Earth

Today we discussed the essential elements of the Nitrogen and Phosphorous Cycles and their significance as "Biogeochemical Cycles" referencing the transfer of chemical substances through abiotic and biotic spheres. We learned that Nitrogen comprises approximately 78% of the atmosphere and only 3.3% of the human body's composition. Nitrogen, despite its small composition in the human body, is an essential element in many of the vital functions of muscle construction and building. Phosphorous is also related to Nitrogen as a viable substance essential to biotic systems and processes. Phosphorous unlike Nitrogen is not found in the atmosphere, but in the Earth's crust. However, phosphorous comprises approximately 1% of the human body as well as the same amount proportionately of the Earth's crust. Both Nitrogen and Phosphorous are in finite quantities on Earth but are replenished through a constant flux process involving the production of organic and inorganic forms.
