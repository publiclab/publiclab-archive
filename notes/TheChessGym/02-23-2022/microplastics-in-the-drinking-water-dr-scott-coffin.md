"Microplastics In The Drinking Water" by Dr. Scott Coffin --https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZcaplhvQoQ

  
Dr. Coffin presented a very enterprising and thought provoking video on the importance of research regarding microplastics and their effects on the human body. Dr. Coffin also is responsible for regulating companies that utilize, produce, and manufacture plastic receptacles  that store drinking water. The dominant area of research and legislation in plastic pollutants remains at the microplastic levels due to limited technology. However, Dr. Coffin advocates the development of advanced technological research that will allow for the testing of nanoplastic contaminants that could be potentially harmful for human consumption. Despite tests revealing plastic contaminants affecting reproduction in lab rats, the "jury" is still out on whether microplastics (and smaller "nanoplastics") could have long-term effects on human fertility.
