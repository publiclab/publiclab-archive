Changes Our Environment Can Be Dangerous To Life As We Know

Changes to Our Environment Can Be Dangerous to Life as We Know 

This morning's class began with an in-depth study as to the impacts of invasive species on our ecosystems near and dear to us. "What Are Endangered and Threatened Species?" The title provoked a study of the factors that contribute to making a distinction between species that are considered "endangered" and those designated as "threatened" regarding their respective populations. The article went on to depict that both terms refer to decreasing numbers of said species resulting from changes to their habitat, food sources, predation, and overall changing environment. "Threatened" classification of a species refers to its potential for extinction. Extinction is the highest alarm as it refers to the permanent removal of an entire species from life on this planet. The term "Endangered" is a classification that warns that a species population is close to advancing to the realm of total extinction. 

The E.P.A. and several other agencies have taken on the mission of presenting information, along with enacting legislation that speaks to the sustaining, maintaining, and preserving of the environment. Hence the importance of an agency such as Public Lab which not only raises awareness among everyday citizens to the changes in our environment, but also provides platforms for those citizens to take an active role in their preservation. Public Lab and agencies like it empower the everyday citizen with tools necessary to contribute to the success of their own immediate environment.
