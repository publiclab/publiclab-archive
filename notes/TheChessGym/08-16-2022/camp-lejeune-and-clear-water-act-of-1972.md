Today we learned that the Clear Water Act of 1972 was enacted to protect people from being exposed to toxic contaminants in their drinking water. The present Class Action Lawsuit waged against Camp Lejeune declares that the Military knowingly allowed residents of the camp exposure to carcinogenic contaminants in the drinking water for years. The lawsuit further asserts that the military officers and their families were allowed to drink these harmful substances without warning or any attempts by the government to avert the danger. The study of Environmental Science includes such studies and interests relevant to human health based on our environment.
