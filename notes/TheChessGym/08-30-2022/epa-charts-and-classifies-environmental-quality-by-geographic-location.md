The lesson today required the students to look at the Environmental Protection Agency's graphs regarding the environment in which they live. The exercise also prompted the students to view this data across the following spheres (atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, and biosphere) and the designation of the quality in those respective areas. The assignment directed the participants to classify each sphere as "healthy", "moderate", or "dangerous" as specified by the EPA. Considering that the domain in which these students reside has been termed as "Cancer Alley", the charts can provide some very impactful information. One student recognized that some of the information regarding Louisiana was outdated. This prompted the group to cross-reference this dated information with more recent findings provided by Public Lab!

The EPA presented charts denoting the quality of the "atmosphere" which speaks to the quality of air we breathe in the despite the contaminants and pollutants emitted into the air by industrial plants every second. The present air quality designation of Reserve, La. was graded as "good" which has been cautiously classified as "healthy". Students were also asked to reference classifications from the EPA regarding the soil, water, and living beings' health based on the charts. Public Lab provided them with current data with which to cross-reference It should be noted that these facts were recorded as of the time of this post regarding Worldometer.info: 

The current world population is 7,979,988,140 people. 

The number of people with no access to a safe drinking water source is 779,541,640\. 

The number of deaths caused by water related diseases is 556,577 this year.
