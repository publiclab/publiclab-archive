The Nitrogen Cycle discussion is one that is interesting, engaging, and essential to understanding some of the foundational processes that promote the healthy function of the planet we call, Earth. Fixation, Assimilation, Decomposition, Ammonification, Nitrification, and finally Denitrification are the integral step processes involved in the Nitrogen Cycle Processes. Fixation involves the transfer of Nitrogen from its gaseous state to nitrates, nitrites, ammonia, and ammonium compounds. Assimilation involves the transfer of Nitrogen from the soil into the roots of plants. Animals then consume plants and excrete the nitrogen through their waste which then starts the Decomposition. Nitrogen waste is then transformed into Ammonia by bacteria. Nitrogen is next combined with oxygen in an aerobic process "Nitrification". Finally, Nitrogen undergoes a anaerobic process where oxygen is replaced by Nitrogen gas and the cycle repeats itself all over again. Hence even though Nitrogen is finite and limited, we will never completely exhaust it as it is part of a cycle.
