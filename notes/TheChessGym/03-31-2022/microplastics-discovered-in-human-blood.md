Approximately six days ago, scientists made a monumental discovery\_\_\_ microplastics detected in human blood! Albeit this discovery is novel, it is far from surprising. Microplastic pollutants and particles have previously been discovered in human waste, on human skin, inside human lungs, inside human stomachs, and even in human placentae. The experiment selected 22 random human volunteers who submitted blood samples for testing. The test results revealed findings of microplastics in the blood of 17 humans. Hence 80% of the subjects tested showed evidence of microplastics present in their blood. Several of the subjects had at least two different forms of microplastics in their bloodstream. These findings, though alarming, are expected given the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in today's world and the myriad of venues in which humans are exposed to them. Microplastics are in the air we breathe, they are in and on the clothes, we wear, they are in the water we drink, they are in the soil of the crops we farm and even in the food we consume. 

Scientists and doctors are trying to determine the long-term effects of microplastic intrusion into human bodies and now, human blood. Studies have detected white blood cells aka (the body's commando border patrol) mobilizing to ward off the microplastic intruders. The video shorts on "Microplastics in Human Blood" have also stated that humans are responsible for disposing of approximately 400, 000,000 million plastic water bottles yearly!!! Microplastics are not biodegradable and thus will add to our growing and global waste problem. 

Comparing and contrasting the articles on this revolutionary find was remarkably interesting. There is a consensus on these facts across each article: 1\. Microplastic pollution represents a human problem. 2\. Microplastics have infiltrated human bodies through drinking water, consuming certain foods, and while performing normal bodily functions, breathing air, and even human digestion. 3\. Scientists are clueless as to the long-range consequences of microplastics and the types of adverse effects they may pose for the human body.
