Today we learned that our Hydrosphere is one of our most valuable natural resources. Statistics show that approximately 71% of the earth's surface is comprised of water. The earth's waters is composed of 97% saltwater and only 3% freshwater. This emphasizes the importance of preserving this usable natural resource. The worldometer estimates that at the time of this post 779,000 people have no access o a drinkable water resource in conjunction with over 550,000 people who have died from water related diseases. This is one of the mediums that an organization like Public Lab addresses.
