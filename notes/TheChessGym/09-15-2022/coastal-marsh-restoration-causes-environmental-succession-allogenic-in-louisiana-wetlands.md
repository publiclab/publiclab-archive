Coastal Marsh Restoration Causes Environmental Succession (Allogenic) In Louisiana Wetlands

Today we learned about Louisiana's efforts to restore marsh and coastal lands that have been diminished over the years resulting from natural erosion and tropical weather events. The effects of this man-made restoration effort will have both pros and cons. The coastal wetlands form a natural barrier to approaching tropical systems such as hurricanes and tropical storms. Restoring these barrier islands is necessary but doing so requires the influx of tons of fresh water into previously salt-water fisheries. The influx of fresh water poses a drastic change to the biomes and ecosystems that formed the niche of saltwater fisheries. Hence, species like the white shrimp, brown shrimp, oysters, speckled trout, redfish, flounder, and other popular salt-water delicacies are immediately adversely impacted. The populations of these species die, decrease and decline. The reduction in these populations immediately impacts the revenue of Louisiana Fishing industry which is a major source of revenue for the state.

Environmental succession is inevitable and represents a healthy change in our ecosystems. Due to the damage caused by Hurricane Ida, new biomes and niches will result which in turn will promote the growth of new diverse numbers of species. The changes resulting from the restoration of marshlands will also promote and drive the broadening of a newer and richer habitat that will provide a new home for additional species to expand and thrive.
