Biodiversity is important to our survival as a species! Today we learned about biodiversity, its meaning, importance, and impact on our environment. The term "Biodiversity" is really a compound of two words: "bio" referring to life or living things, and "diverse" meaning variety. Hence biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms in an environment. Biodiversity also speaks to the size of each species' population. Thus, an environment with a variety of species that can boast of large populations of that species would represent a healthy environment that is diverse! Biodiversity also reflects the impact living organisms have on each other as they are all interdependent. 

The lesson went on to feature a documentary that reflected the diminishing "Blue Fin" Tuna population that has decreased by 95%. Couple this fact with the Blue Fin tuna being the fish that is the most popularly demanded fish for human consumption and bang! Humankind has almost fished, exported, imported, and consumed this species to extinction. What would happen to the diversity of our oceans if there were no more Blue-Fin Tuna? Thanks to agencies like Public Lab everyone can be made aware of this change and its impact on our changing environment.
