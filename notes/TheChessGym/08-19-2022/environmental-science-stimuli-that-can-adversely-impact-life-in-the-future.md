[null](https://www.worldometers.info/)Environmental Science Stimuli That Can Adversely Impact Life
In The Future

This morning, I
asked my students to peer into the statistics located on the Worldometer ([https://www.worldometers.info/](https://www.worldometers.info/)) regarding the following areas: 1\. World Population 2\. Births this year 3\.
Deaths this year 3\. People Who Have Access to Drinking Water 4\. People who have
access to food 5\. People who have access to Health Care. All of these
disciplines and the data projections depicted by the Worldometer have a direct
impact on the lives of students at the present with the potential of dramatically
adversely affecting their lives in the future. There are presently (at the time
of writing this article) almost 9 billion people living on planet Earth. This
number is due to the rate of births per second estimated at about 2.5 people
per second contrasted against approximately 1 death of a human somewhere around
the world dying every second. The population increase also directly impacts the
mortality rate in addition to the rise in the numbers of people who have no
access to drinking water, food, and health care. Couple these alarming numbers
with rapidly depleting natural resources of energy, food, and water, make for
immediate attention given to the subject of Environmental Science as a whole.
The environment and the effects of climate change, pollution, and the
mismanagement of current natural resources are all valid reasons to sound the
alarm for awareness relating to the restoration, cultivation, and preservation
of our Environment. Hence, the importance of  an agency like Public Lab and their contributions to the studies in Environmental Science for students, teachers, parents, and the like.
