Today we learned about another important natural water resource, the aquifer. Aquifers are underground canteens of fresh water that has infiltrated permeable soil and porous rock sediment. This soil and sediment also can act as a natural filter of certain pollutants and harmful particles. Half of our parish relies on the Mississippi River as a natural water resource while the other parish depends on underground aquifers. In addition, some residents utilize private underground wells. The Ogallala Aquifer is the largest aquifer in the United States and one of the largest aquifers in the world. It is estimated that this freshwater resource can boast of containing over 978 trillion gallons of water! The Aquifer is also known as the High Plains Aquifer and portions of it extends to Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Kansas, and South Dakota.
