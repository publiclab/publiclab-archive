The following You Tube Video entitled, "The DIY Community Microscope Kit" by | Public Lab", provided some interesting information to me regarding the formation of this public organization. Subsequent to the "Gulf Oil Spill" in 2010, this organization began with a group of concerned citizens who wanted to actively and personally engage in the observation, exploration, preservation, and conservation of the ecosystem directly impacting their community. Public Lab started as an initiative for residents of communities desiring a more active role in the sciences impacting the ecosystem they live in without blind reliance on government funded entities. Public Lab has grown in size and has advanced in its mission to provide an opportunity for the public to partner in the preservation and conservation of our environment.
