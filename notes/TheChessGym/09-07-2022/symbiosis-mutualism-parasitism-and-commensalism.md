The class was introduced to the themes of Symbiosis and symbiotic relationships that exist in our ecosystem. Their interest soared to see how different living organisms relate and rely of each other to thrive in their existence, The term "interdependence" described this balance of interaction that extends from species to species in all ecosystems. The lesson advanced upon this theme to breakdown the types of symbiotic relationships between species and their eventual impact on the ecosystem and environment. Mutualism is the relationship in symbiosis where both species benefit from the relationship as in that of the Tilapia fish, and Farm raised Catfish. Parasitism is a branch of symbiosis where one species may benefit from the relationship to the detriment of the other as in the case with dogs and fleas. Lastly, "commensalism" refers to the symbiosis relationship where only one species benefits exclusively but does not cause harm to the other species as in the case with some trees and insects that live on them. All of these relationships contribute to the welfare of each ecosystem and environment. Any interruptions of these relationships at even the smallest levels can adversely affect an ecosystem and an entire environment.
