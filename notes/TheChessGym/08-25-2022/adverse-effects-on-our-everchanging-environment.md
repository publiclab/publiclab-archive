Today we explored the environmental changes brought on by several types of invasive species. One such example is that of the changing ecosystem in the Florida everglades brought on by the Burmese Python. The Python is not a species indigenous to the Florida everglades and has been carelessly introduced to this once stable biome. The changes that have resulted has rapidly changing biome of the Florida Everglades, albeit changes that are detrimental to this ecosystem. The Python has now flourished in this foreign environment making it the new apex predator over the Alligator. This abrupt shift in this ecosystem has now placed many different species of animals(now of the python's menu) on the "endangered species" list. Our environment is crucial to the existence of all life on the planet, hence the need for concern and immediate intervention. Thanks to organizations like Public Lab, EPA, and National Geographic for raising awareness to these issues.
