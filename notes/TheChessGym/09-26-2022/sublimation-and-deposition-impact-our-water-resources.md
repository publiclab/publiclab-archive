Sublimation and Deposition Impact Our Water Resources

The Water Cycle is an interesting and involved process representing the massive and continual transition of water through its three states. Water exists in one of three states, solid, liquid, or gas. The Water Cycle thus illustrates how the Earth replenishes its water. The two types of water on planet Earth are saltwater and fresh water. There is approximately 97.5 percent of the water that is saltwater, while only 2.5 percent of the Earths' water is fresh. It should also be noted that a large quantity of the Earth's fresh water is not readily drinkable. 

The processing of the water on Earth through this cycle involves Melting (from ice glaciers to liquid), freezing (from liquid to ice), Evaporation (from liquid to gas), Condensation (from vapor to liquid) precipitation (condensed water falls) Sublimation (from solid to gas) and Deposition (from vapor to solid).
