The WHO (World Health Organization) reports that there have been 298, 404 deaths so far this year resulting from water borne diseases. Their website also states that there are currently approximately 2.2 billion people in the world that have NO access to water! The worldometer in turn calculations are updated with every new birth indicates that there are approximately 782, 553, 344 (at the time of this article) people without access to a drinkable water source. These are startling numbers given the ready access to drinkable water resources we enjoy here in the United States of America. 

However, every human requires water to survive and hence they must consume water even if it is undrinkable. Thus, there are organizations, councils, and programs that have formed to not only provide water to those without, but also to regulate the quality of drinking water for all. Water is not just a human right; it is a requirement for all living organisms. 

The E.P.A. denotes that President Clinton Signed Legislation to Ensure Americans Safe Drinking Water on August 6, 1996\. A synopsis of this legislation revealed parameters and guidelines to insure safe drinking water for every state in the U.S. 

The WHO produced suggestions for safe drinking water quality in 2006 and delineated parameters for the designations of "safe" drinking water that were intricately detailed, meticulous, and microbe specific. 

The E.P.A. restrictions on safe drinking water quality are specific to water resources here in the United States while the W.H.O. deals with waters sources around the world. Hence the need for W.H.O. regulations being much vaster and more microbe specific.
