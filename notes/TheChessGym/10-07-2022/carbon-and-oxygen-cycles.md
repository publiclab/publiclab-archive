The Oxygen and Carbon Cycles are crucial contributors to the cycles of life. The Carbon and Oxygen cycles are intrinsically connected to the Water Cycle. Hence, the use of the term "cycle' refers to the continuous flow and replenishing and refreshing of the vital resources necessary for life, matter, and the structure, composition, and function of our planet. Our human bodies are comprised of approximately 19% carbon, while oxygen makes up approximately 66%.  Oddly, Carbon makes up approximately 0.03 percent of the earth, while oxygen represents 21% of the earth's atmosphere. Carbon accounting for approximately 99% of the earth's rock and crust, it also represents the earth's volume. 

Humans and animals utilize oxygen and carbon for a myriad of processes ranging from respiration to digestion and finally, decomposition upon death. Carbon and Oxygen are constantly transported through the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere.  It is also amazing to imagine the relationship to Carbon and its function in controlling our Earth's core temperature. Overall, the Carbon and Oxygen Cycles are vital to the existence, function, and survival of planet earth. Hence, the study of these two substances along with understanding their protection, correct use, preservation, and conservation are mandatory for maintaining a healthy environment for all life.
