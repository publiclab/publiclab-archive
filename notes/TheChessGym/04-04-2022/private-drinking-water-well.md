Obtaining Your Private Drinking Water Well 

Amid all of the cutting-edge theory surrounding microplastics, pollutants, contaminants, and chemical wastes infiltrating our air, soil, food, bodies, and water, it behooves one to explore opportunities to obtain vital resources from places devoid of spoilage. Drinking water is a vital resource required by every living organism. However, scientists are discovering more and more water sources that have been contaminated by man-made pollutants and chemical wastes. Drawing from surface water sources compromises water quality as they are more frequently exposed to contamination and pollution than underground water sources. Hence, enter the resurgence of private underground drinking water wells. The wells complete with aquifers (porous rock and sediment that provides a natural filter for ground water) provide a much cleaner and healthier water resource than surface water resources. 

Unfortunately, private drinking water-wells are costly and require that the owner provide constant monitoring, testing, and preserving of their water source. The owner must also secure and complete the application and permit to build the private well in addition to paying the extremely hefty price to construct one. 

Albeit, the thought of cleaner drinking water free of pollutants sounds appealing, the maintenance, preservation of and maintenance of such a well is far more painstaking.
