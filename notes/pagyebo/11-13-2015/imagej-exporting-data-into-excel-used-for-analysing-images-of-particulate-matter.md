Purpose

Our aim was to extract the following data - area, perimeter and shape descriptions of passively-collected aerosol particle samples using digital microscope images.  See the following research notes for other background:  as done by [@Damarquis,] for further analysis Using ImageJ to process passive particle monitor samples as suggested by [@mathew ], analyzing passive monitors
by [@mathew], Deploying UNC passive sampler on South Side of Chicago  by [@AmberWise]

We used the analysis methods in ImageJ, and followed these steps to get our data extracted. 
At the final step, the data needs to be exported into a spreadsheet file for further calculations.  On PC-type computers, this dialogue box appeared at end of the image J processing. We followed the outlined processes below to get our data extracted for further calculations 
•	Click yes in the dialogue box shown below. It will take you to the 3steps process of Text Import Wizard.

Step 1 :  Select Delimited in the dialogue box. Click next.

The numbers in the left column 1,2,3… of the preview shows the number of particles analysed with the image J.

Step 2  .     Select Tab and Click next

Step 3. Select General and click finish
The data showed the area, perimeter, shape (Round) of each particle analyzed with the image J. The analyzed data will be imported to excel for further calculations.
