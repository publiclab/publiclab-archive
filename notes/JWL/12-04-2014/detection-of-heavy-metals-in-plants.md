Hi all,

any ideas on a pratical method for detecting heavy metals in plants such as grass or maize? I would like to use (aerial) photo's instead of measuring each plant separately.
Heavy metals cause a shift in the "red edge" and there are other spectral vegetation indices that are influenced.
In literature a resolution of 3nm is cited. Red edge is around 710 nm. NDVI uses red and NIR. 

Thanks, Johan
