I split the DVD that came with the spectrometer kit. There are now four parts:

  
1\. the top side, dull  

2\. the top side, glowing with rainbow colors (the opposite side has text)  

3\. the bottom side, clear with a purple tint

4\. the bottom side, glowing with rainbow colors

  
Which part should I cut for the spectrometer?   

  
Thank you for any tips!
