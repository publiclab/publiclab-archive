The use of a radio-controlled DJI Phantom quadcopter with a GoPro camera has proved to be a valuable tool to help document features best seen from the air. The GoPro camera can be set for interval photography (e.g. every 5 seconds) and the fisheye image distortion can be reasonably corrected in Photoshop. This approach minimizes impact on sensitive sites by eliminating the need to walk all over them.
