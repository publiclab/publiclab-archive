Nuestros Suelos (Our Soils) is a Chilean research initiative aiming at _designing, testing and disseminating a
toolkit for participative soil degradation assessment based on a citizen
science sensibility and low-cost technologies_. The kit includes three main components. First, a set
of participatory methodologies for the systematization of local knowledge and care
practices regarding soils. Second, a series of low-cost technologies for the
qualitative assessment of some key indicators of soil degradation, in
particular fertility (organic matter, carbonates, N-P-K, and pH) and the
presence of heavy metals (Copper and Arsenic). Finally, a board game that seeks
to help members of the participating communities to integrate and use the
knowledge acquired to deal with specific challenges related to soil degradation.
