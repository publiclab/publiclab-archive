So i am new to this and i have not been able to find a lot of info. this question has three parts. firstly i am using a PI No ir V2 camera with a blue filter to map a field. firstly i keep seeing things that say that it need to calibrate it. What am i calibrating and how? secondly secondly i want to take these photos and stitch them together to create a larger map that i can then process with NDVI. So what is the best software for processing NDVI ? i tried the inframgram.org one but i am looking for the one that shows green as healthy and red as not healthy. Can anyone help a noob out ?
