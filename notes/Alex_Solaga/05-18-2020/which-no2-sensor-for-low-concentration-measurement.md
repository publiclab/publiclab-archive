Hello everybody,

  
I am working on a air purifier for traffic hot spots that works with micro bacteria.

Now it is time to test the prototype.

  
I want to monitor the absorption of **NO2 .

I have seen a few projects of air quality sensing, and all of them use the MICs2710 (or similar low budget sensors).   

I don't get why. The detection range starts at about 0.2 ppm.   

Here (Berlin, Germany) we have between 2 - 50 ppb (with a maximum value of 100ppb, due to EU restrictions)

I want to connect it to a Arduino.  

  
Can you recommend a sensor, or manufacturer for my needs? (Doesnt have to be low budget)  

  
  
Thank you!

Alex
