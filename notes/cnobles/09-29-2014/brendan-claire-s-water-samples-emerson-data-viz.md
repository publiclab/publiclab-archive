****First sample****
Location: 42.359242, -71.067777
Type: puddle water
Conductivity guess: high

This sample was collected outside the Beacon Hill Market on Anderson and Myrtle St. There were several cigarette butts and other pieces of trash floating around in the puddle -- Beacon Hill, one of Boston's oldest neighborhoods (dating back to the 1600s), has cobbled narrow streets. Trash pickup, done twice a week, consists of residents putting their bags of trash out on the street without trashcans. This causes a lot of litter to be on the street, thus why this puddle is so dirty.

****Second Sample****
Location: 42.351479, -71.062932
Type: puddle water
Conductivity guess: high

This sample was collected in Chinatown, right across the street from Pho Pasteur. It was a hot day when it was collected, so the puddle was evaporating. Chinatown in Boston is the only surviving Chinese area in the New England area, so it attracts a lot of tourists and foot traffic. This intersection is interesting, as it is right next to some strip clubs, restaurants, and then a brand new luxury apartment building. This area has seen a lot of development over the past few years, and it is continuously gentrifying every day.

****Third Sample****
Location: 42.351534, -71.063501
Type: puddle water/runoff from fire hydrant
Conductivity guess: high, but lower than rest

This sample was collected just down the street from the second sample, but it was runoff from a fire hydrant, right next to a construction site. Because it is runoff from a fire hydrant, it should be a lower conductivity than the other samples, which had been sitting in the street for a while.
