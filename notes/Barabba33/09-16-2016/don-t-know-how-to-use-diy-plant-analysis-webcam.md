Guys i've just bought a DIY Plant Analysis Webcam form Infragram and I don't really understand how to make it work.
I've plugged the USB and the driver has been installed, but when I go to http://infragram.org/sandbox/ and clic on "connect to a camera" it just says that there are no cameras available.
Could you help me find the way to make it work?
