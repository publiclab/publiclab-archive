This past week, I have been learning about Unix Shell, and how to use the command lines effective. In doing this, I have learned how to create files, sort them using directories, make folders, change file names, and much more. I have also begun working with git and GitHub, so more updates on that to follow. Lastly, I was able to set up a headless configuration with my MacBook and Raspberry Pi so my setup has gotten a lot less cluttered making it easier to work!
