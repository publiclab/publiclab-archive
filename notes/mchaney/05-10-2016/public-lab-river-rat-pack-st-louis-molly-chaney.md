Participating in this class has been a huge learning experience for me. For the past four years, I have settled into my comfort zone of problem sets, quantitative exams, and lab reports; and the way this course worked out was far outside of that math and science bubble. I developed a greater sense of patience and allowed myself to be comfortable with the fact that the goals of the course grew and evolved as the semester went on. I learned that other fonts exist besides Times New Roman (haha) and gained an appreciation for the importance of presentation in making science accessible to everyone. Working with students and professionals outside of my main discipline was eye-opening, and it was exciting to be a part of something truly inter-disciplinary. 
My contributions to the exhibit were the text paragraphs that provided an introduction to each site that we presented. Most of them were scientific and hydrology-focused, and some were more focused on St. Louis history, urban design, and landscape architecture. On those ones, I collaborated with others and felt like we really had a team environment going. Overall, I really had no idea what to expect going into this class (and I'm not sure anyone knew what to expect)  but I'm very pleased with what I've learned and what we've created.
