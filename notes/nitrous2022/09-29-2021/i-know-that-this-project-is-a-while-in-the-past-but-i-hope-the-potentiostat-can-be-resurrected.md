there seems to be a lot of interest in the potentiostat project.

I'd like to connect with the original author to see what might be needed to put this back onto the kit offerings.

I'm a former physical chemist - long time ago before jumping over to medicine...   

  
But I'm also recently retired.... so... :)

Thanks folks.
