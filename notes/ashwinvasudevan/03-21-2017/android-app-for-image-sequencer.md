About me  

Hello, I am Ashwin Vasudevan, currently pursuing B.E in Electronics and Instrumentation engineering at Easwari Engineering College, Chennai. I have a variety of skills from app development to UI/UX to ROS and embedded. Last year, I obtained a 100,000 grant from Analog Devices India as a part of an IOT fellowship named "Anveshan". In this fellowship, I was working on an IOT platform which collects and analyzes data to improve agriculture intelligence. The platform interfaced with public lab's cameras(Mobius Action cam) and thus obtained false NIR images.

**Affiliation** Easwari Engineering College (Anna University)

**Location:** Chennai

## Project description

By developing an app for Image Sequencer, the services of public labs are available to a wider user base. It helps public labs build a stronger brand and thus bring in more people to contribute towards their mission. Apart from image sequencer'\_\_s features, one significant addon that I plan to add will be batch processing. Image sequencer will not only be applicable towards publiclab's community but also the wider image processing community.

### Abstract/summary (<20 words): I will be developing an android app for in image-sequencer

### Needs

Provided that I am selected, I would require help in exposing the webhooks. As Mr.Jeffrey Warren pointed out developing a fully native app will be difficult to maintain. Hence I will be using a wrapper.
