Hello, 
I looked everywhere to buy the S100, but could not find a seller who is ready to import it to India. Instead, I am looking forward to buy the mobius action cam from public labs itself. I will mounting the cam on my drone based on beaglebone - https://github.com/mirkix/BBBMINI(Great project). 

Would you recommend me to go with mobius? I would be using the cam for NDVI analysis.
