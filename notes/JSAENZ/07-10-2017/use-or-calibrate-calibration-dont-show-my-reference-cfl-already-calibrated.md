Hello, i'm a newbie from Spain ( Seville ).

I've uploaded an image of a light bulb CFL and I've calibrated it fine.

When I try to upload a new spectrum image from sun for example the pop list don't show me my calibrated reference, only show "[+] Use or create".

I've view your videos and I can see how this pop list show a reference calibrated.

I think I do something wrong, Why cannot I select my calibrated reference?

Thank you.
