# Can anyone help me troubleshoot my NDVI imagery?

Hello all,

I have assembled a Mobius camera with Public Lab's infrared lens, have focused the lens, and went outside to take some pictures. It is autumn, so many of the plants are more orange than green, but the trees still had a fair share of green on them. 

However, when I upload the images to http://www.infragram.org I am not achieving the results that I expected. Are my expectations erroneous? Other opportunities for failure were:

* The assembly
* The config file
* The plants not being green enough
* A processing glitch
* Who knows

Here is the base image that I have taken, without any digital editing.

This image is of course taken using the public lab NDVI lens installed into the mobius camera. 

When I upload it to www.infragram.org and choose the basic present for the NDVI red filter images, I am returned a mostly black screen:

When I ask infragram.org to return a colorized analysis instead of a basic one, the analysis is still a bit strange:

Does anyone know what needs to be changed here so that I can get better photos? Does anything at all need to be changed? Please help out!
