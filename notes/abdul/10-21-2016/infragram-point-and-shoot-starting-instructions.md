### Introduction

So you've just opened your [Infragram Point & Shoot](/wiki/infragram-point-shoot)! You'll notice that it's based on a commercial product called the [Mobius Action Cam](https://www.mobius-actioncam.com/), so all of the guides here apply to any other Mobius Action Cam.

For more guides on using your camera, see [Infragram Point & Shoot activities](/wiki/infragram-point-shoot#Activities) or [all Infragram activities](/wiki/infragram#Activities) for more ways to use your hacked camera. And since Public Lab is a collaborative, [open-source community](/wiki/licenses#Why+Open+Source?), we also ask that you **share your own ideas, improvements and workarounds** and work as step-by-step activities for others to try!

### Take a picture

There are three basic modes to the camera, which you can switch through with the **M** button, and each shows a different color on the main LED.

Once you've loaded the custom white balance in the config file (see below) and charged up the camera, you're ready to use it -- just turn it on, press **M** twice, until you see a RED light. Then you can use the "Shutter" button which looks like: __, to take photos. The red light will blink.

**Note on firmware:** If you bought your Infragram Point and Shoot [from the Public Lab Store](http://store.publiclab.org/products/infragram-point-shoot-plant-cam) then it is very unlikely that you will need a [firmware update](#Firmware). But if you are modifying your own Mobius Action Cam, you may need to update your camera.

---------

### Installing the filter

To install a lens with a modified filter (or any lens) into a Mobius camera, you will need:

- the camera
- your new lens
- a size 0 philips screwdriver and
- a small hex screwdriver.

For step-by-step instructions on changing the lens or swapping a filter, see this guide; it should take about 15-25 minutes:

[https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-19-2017/install-a-filter-or-change-the-lens-in-a-mobius-action-cam](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-19-2017/install-a-filter-or-change-the-lens-in-a-mobius-action-cam)

After you've put everything back together, you may need to update your camera's software.

---------

## Firmware

Your Mobius camera may need the latest firmware installed. Follow these instructions to update your firmware:

https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-20-2017/update-firmware-on-the-mobius-action-cam

****

## Configuration & white balance

Distinct from the firmware update is the config file, which lets you set things like the timelapse interval (if you're doing timelapse) and the **white balance**, which is critical for using the Mobius as an Infragram camera. 

To change the configuration (including the essential white balance adjustments), see this activity:

https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-23-2017/change-the-white-balance-or-other-configuration-on-a-mobius-camera

---------

### Focusing

Once you've changed the lens, you may need to refocus the camera. Follow this activity to make focus adjustments:
