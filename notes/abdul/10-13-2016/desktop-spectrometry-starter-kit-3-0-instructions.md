##Introduction

These instructions will guide you through the assembly process of the desktop spectrometer. This guide is an [activity](https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry#Activities) and you can check the activity grid for spectrometry to find what you'll want to do next, which is [calibrate your spectrometer](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-01-2016/calibrating-your-spectrometer-in-spectral-workbench)

**If you would like to print these instructions, [download the pdf file here](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/968/original/instruction_booklet_1.0-print-halfpage.pdf)**

This kit must be handled and stored carefully, as [rough treatment can affect calibration by >6nm](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-17-2016/stress-testing-the-desktop-spectrometry-starter-kit) -- consider keeping it in a sturdy box like the one it came in, or upgrading it to increase stability .  (Read on!)

### If you have found any way to improve this kit for any specific usage, share it! 

As an example, Public Lab user [stoft](https://publiclab.org/profile/stoft) has made an adjustment to [improve the stability of the desktop spectrometer](https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/09-16-2016/stability-upgrade-mockup-for-plab-spectrometer-3-0), something that may be important when analyzing fluorescent materials and for many other usages. Please try out this upgrade and others that can be found in our [upgrades grid](https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry#Upgrades)

[You can also post your own, new upgrade for people to try](https://publiclab.org/post?tags=upgrade:spectrometry,seeks:builds&title=How%20to%20do%20X) and if you have an idea or a need, but aren't sure how to solve it yourself, you can [request an upgrade here](https://publiclab.org/post?tags=request:upgrade,page:spectrometry&template=question&title=How%20do%20I...&redirect=question)

#Assembly

Your spectrometer is composed of three functional elements:

* a collimation slit that works as a lens, only allowing parallel light rays through its apeture.
* a diffraction grating that deflects light more the lower the light's wavelength, creating a rainbow diffraction pattern.
* a camera to capture the diffraction pattern, focused on the collimation slit.

These elements are mounted on an adjustable velcro bench in a black paper box.

[![IMG_20150210_143526_corrected-labeled.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/891/medium/IMG_20150210_143526_corrected-labeled.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/891/original/IMG_20150210_143526_corrected-labeled.png)

****

##Bench

###Put velcro on the bench

Everything is built up from the bench, an ash board 4cm (1.75 inches) wide.  We will cover it with the loop tape (fuzzy side of the velcro).

[![IMG_20150210_160302-edit.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/895/medium/IMG_20150210_160302-edit.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/895/original/IMG_20150210_160302-edit.jpg)

[![velcro-labeled.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/894/medium/velcro-labeled.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/894/original/velcro-labeled.png)

The velcro loop tape is slightly wider than half the width of the bench, two strips will hang over each edge a bit. 

[![IMG_20150210_160318-edit.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/896/medium/IMG_20150210_160318-edit.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/896/original/IMG_20150210_160318-edit.jpg)

****

###Assemble the camera block

You will need the camera, double-sided tape, the block, and the hook side of the velcro tape.  Try to hold the camera by its edges, as it can be sensitive to electrical shorts. 

[![IMG_20150210_150024-ed-labels.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/956/medium/IMG_20150210_150024-ed-labels.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/956/original/IMG_20150210_150024-ed-labels.png)

Start by putting a strip of double-sided tape on the back side of the camera:

[![IMG_20150210_150202.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/957/medium/IMG_20150210_150202.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/957/original/IMG_20150210_150202.jpg)

Remove the pink protective film from the double-sided tape and attach to the center of the block's 45-degree angled side, with the white cable port on top:

[![IMG_20150210_150230.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/958/medium/IMG_20150210_150230.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/958/original/IMG_20150210_150230.jpg)

[![IMG_20150210_150258.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/900/medium/IMG_20150210_150258.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/900/original/IMG_20150210_150258.jpg)

On the underside of the block, attach two short strips of the hook tape (the Velcro's scratchy side). 

[![IMG_20150210_150318.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/901/medium/IMG_20150210_150318.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/901/original/IMG_20150210_150318.jpg)

_OPTIONAL: Make the camera focus more precise. The camera's tiny lens is pre-focused to roughly 200mm at the factory, but you can do a little better.  This requires twisting the lens until it is no longer held in place by the green glue on the lens, which is easiest after the camera is mounted on the block.  Pliers may be needed. Once loose, point the camera at a target (like text) 200mm away and carefully twisting the camera lens until the image is in clearest focus._ 

See [more research on lens focus](/n/7226).

###Make a diffraction grating from a DVD

**Do not touch the surface of the DVD, always hold it by the edges, fingerprints will blur this important optical component.**

We are going to turn a DVD-R into a diffraction grating, a device for separating light by frequency. An ideal diffraction grating would create a straight rainbow. A DVD produces a curved rainbow, but its rigidity and consistency make it a very good grating, and the tiny webcam lens curves the spectrum anyways. Aligning your diffraction grating will take some tweaking. We’ve given you extra material to help.

[![ideal-vs-dvd-grating-ed.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/903/medium/ideal-vs-dvd-grating-ed.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/903/original/ideal-vs-dvd-grating-ed.png)

We have three steps, cutting a quarter of the DVD out, peeling off the reflective aluminum side, and trimming to a small piece.

[![cutpeeltrim-labeled.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/905/medium/cutpeeltrim-labeled.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/905/original/cutpeeltrim-labeled.png)

_OPTIONAL: Wash the purple ink off of the DVD fragment for greater light transmission, as [described in this note](/n/11515)._

####Peel apart a quarter of the DVD

Cut out a quarter of the DVD with scissors. It may take more than one try to get a good diffraction grating, so save the rest too.

Use a knife or a fingernail to dig under
the corner of the DVD quarter and peel the two layers apart.

[![IMG_20150210_144414.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/906/medium/IMG_20150210_144414.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/906/original/IMG_20150210_144414.jpg)

[![IMG_20150210_144530-trim.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/907/medium/IMG_20150210_144530-trim.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/907/original/IMG_20150210_144530-trim.jpg)

You will get two layers. We are trying to get a transparent purple piece without aluminum stuck to it. If you can’t find a good piece you may want to try another quarter DVD. You only need a 2cm (.75”) square cut from the outer edge. Trim down to a small square with roughly 2cm of the DVD’s outer edge.

[![IMG_20150210_144232-labeled.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/910/medium/IMG_20150210_144232-labeled.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/910/original/IMG_20150210_144232-labeled.png)

Trim down to a small square with roughly 2cm of the DVD's outer edge.

[![2cm-label.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/913/medium/2cm-label.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/913/original/2cm-label.png)

###Assemble the diffraction grating angle

You will need:

[![IMG_20150210_145901-labeled.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/922/medium/IMG_20150210_145901-labeled.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/922/original/IMG_20150210_145901-labeled.png)

Overview: 

[![IMG_20150210_145742-ed-labeled2.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/916/large/IMG_20150210_145742-ed-labeled2.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/916/original/IMG_20150210_145742-ed-labeled2.png)

When taping the three flaps together, make sure the bottom flaps are lined up. put hook tape on the bottom.

[![IMG_20150210_145304ed.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/917/medium/IMG_20150210_145304ed.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/917/original/IMG_20150210_145304ed.jpg) [![IMG_20150210_145343ed.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/918/medium/IMG_20150210_145343ed.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/918/original/IMG_20150210_145343ed.jpg)

Put the outer edge of the dvd at the mid-point of the hole, and then remove the handles from the binder clip.

[![IMG_20150210_145436ed.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/919/medium/IMG_20150210_145436ed.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/919/original/IMG_20150210_145436ed.jpg)

Put velcro on the bottom.

[![IMG_20150210_145536ed.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/920/medium/IMG_20150210_145536ed.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/920/original/IMG_20150210_145536ed.jpg)

Put the outer edge of the DVD at the mid-point of the hole, and then remove the handles from the binder clip.

[![IMG_20150210_145648ed.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/921/medium/IMG_20150210_145648ed.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/921/original/IMG_20150210_145648ed.jpg)

###Assemble the slit card

You will need:

[![IMG_20150210_150959ed-labeled.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/923/medium/IMG_20150210_150959ed-labeled.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/923/original/IMG_20150210_150959ed-labeled.png)

The collimation slit should be in the DVD sleeve.

_We will attach the slit using the tape as single sided tape-- tape it on top and DO NOT remove the backing film.
_
Line up the collimation slit with the line on the slit card.

***

###Assemble the box

Watch this step-by step video:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/omNE-5Hmltk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

For the purposes of this instructional I've highlighted the edges of the box in white and used an unprinted box. Your box will have a printed and unprinted sides, and no white edges.

Place the box with the printing facing down. Pre-crease all the creases towards you. and crease the box top as well.

[![together1-1ed.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/941/medium/together1-1ed.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/941/original/together1-1ed.jpg)

[![together1-3ed.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/942/medium/together1-3ed.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/942/original/together1-3ed.jpg)

Fold the left side "T" shape over to the right, and insert the tab from the leftmost edge into the slot at the base of the "T", as shown here:

[![together1-2ed.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/943/medium/together1-2ed.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/943/original/together1-2ed.jpg)

Lay the separate box top piece on top so that its tabs line up with the slots in the box bottom’s right side. Make sure the small rectangular holes on the top and bottom of the box line up. We will put the webcam cable through that hole later. Insert the tabs together.  The box top will not lay flat-- don't worry.  this is because there is extra space for the two sheets to fold together.

[![together1-5ed.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/512/large/together1-5ed.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/512/original/together1-5ed.jpg)

[![together1-6ed.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/945/medium/together1-6ed.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/945/original/together1-6ed.jpg)

Now open the box back up and fold left and right side flaps to the middle to form the inner walls. They will hook together.

[![IMG_20150701_141644.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/513/medium/IMG_20150701_141644.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/513/original/IMG_20150701_141644.jpg)

[![together1-12ed.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/951/medium/together1-12ed.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/951/original/together1-12ed.jpg)

Fold the outer walls up and over the inner walls. Use the two circular holes in the outer walls to position the inner walls while folding the outer wall over.

[![together1-13ed.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/952/medium/together1-13ed.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/952/original/together1-13ed.jpg)

Flip the box upside down and make sure the tabs have all popped out of the bottom of the box. Walk your fingers along the inside of the box and make sure all the tabs are popped out of the bottom.

[![together1-15ed.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/954/medium/together1-15ed.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/954/original/together1-15ed.jpg)

###Put it all on the bench

[![IMG_20150210_143526_corrected-labeled.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/924/medium/IMG_20150210_143526_corrected-labeled.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/924/original/IMG_20150210_143526_corrected-labeled.png)

Line up the the bench with the side of the box, and align the camera's lens with the 200mm marker on the side of the box. Press the camera block down firmly.

[![IMG_20150210_144844ed.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/515/medium/IMG_20150210_144844ed.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/515/original/IMG_20150210_144844ed.jpg)

Place the diffraction grating angle directly in front of the camera block and press it down firmly.

[![IMG_20150210_143810.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/926/medium/IMG_20150210_143810.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/926/original/IMG_20150210_143810.jpg)
