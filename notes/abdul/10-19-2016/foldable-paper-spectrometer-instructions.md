## Introduction

These instructions will guide you through the assembly process of the foldable paper spectrometer, our low-cost introductory spectrometry kit. These instructions are an [activity](https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry#Activities) and you can find other spectrometry related activities in our [spectrometry activity grid](https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry#Activity+grid)

> **Update:** There's an updated version of this design available at [Papercraft Spectrometry Kit](/wiki/paper-spec)

Public Lab is collaborative, and we very much want YOU to [post your activities](https://publiclab.org/post?tags=activity:spectrometry,spectrometry,spectrometer,seeks:replications&title=How%20to%20do%20X) to that grid too for others to see, replicate, and learn from.

### If you have found any way to improve this kit, share it!

If you think you might have found a way to improve this kit --even if you aren't certain-- share your ideas! All of our tools and processes are collaborative, and we rely on you, (yes, you!) to drive us forward. If you can think of any improvement, post it in our [upgrades grid](https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry#Upgrades).

### Have a question?

If you have a question about spectrometry, submit your specific queries at [publiclab.org/questions](http://publiclab.org/questions) using a specific, relevant title and specific tags (like spectrometry among others) to make sure that people find it.

If you have a customer service, shipping, ordering, bulk ordering, sales, or business related query then please send an E-mail to [kits@publiclab.org](mailto:kits@publiclab.org)

## What you'll need

The [Foldable Spectrometry Starter Kit](http://store.publiclab.org/collections/spectrometry/products/foldable-mini-spectrometer) comes with everything necessary to construct this, so if you bought one you can skip down to assembly; but if you'd like to build your own, you'll need:

[To print this letter sized pdf](https://publiclab.org/sites/default/files/8.5x11mini-spec3.8.pdf); the first page has build instructions, but the second page should be printed onto sturdy black paper.

You'll also need:

* scissors to cut out the pattern 
* a DVD
* a narrow slit - very precise slits printed on plastic sheets are available on the [Public Lab Store](http://store.publiclab.org/products/acetate-collimation-slits), but you can also make your own using two pieces of paper. 

## Assembly

Instructions for your spectrometer can be printed or viewed on [this letter-sized PDF pattern](https://publiclab.org/sites/default/files/8.5x11mini-spec3.8.pdf) which should also come included in your kit.

You can also follow along with these instructions:

Cut out along the outer edge if not already cut out.

Fold as indicated by the lines. Thinly dotted lines are folded down, dashed lines folded up.

![mini fold-up spectrometer assembly](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8362/8276241429_853d88b402.jpg)

Glue or tape together. Start with the top flap and make sure the edges are aligned.

![mini fold-up spectrometer assembly](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8360/8277298848_5688256a0a.jpg)

Except for the Diffraction grating on door, glue or tape all flaps down to the outside.

To make a diffraction grating from a DVD-R, peel back the reflective layer, and cut a small square out of the transparent layer. See also: [Preparing a DVD-R to act as a diffraction grating](http://publiclab.org/notes/MrBumper/01-11-2015/preparing-a-dvd-r-to-act-as-a-diffraction-grating) for more information on the _optional_ removal of the residual aluminium and dye layers.

![mini fold-up spectrometer assembly](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8276239515_220f6f3307.jpg)

Tape or glue down the DVD-R diffraction grating to the inside of the spectrometer so that the diffraction grating is vertical, producing a horizontal spectral rainbow. Then glue the door closed.

Attach The spectrometer to a webcam with the aid of a box, to a phone, or to a computer.

## Illustrated Assembly Guide

Cut out along the outer edge if not already cut out.

To make a diffraction grating from a DVD-R, cu a square from the outer edge. The DVD has is two layers of plastic. Peel back the reflective layer, and cut a small square out of the transparent layer.
