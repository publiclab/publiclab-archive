### Introduction:

I am residing in a community where more close 80,000 human beings live(pets, human being/ plants). Off late, the Cemeteries have been increased too and space for a human living has reduced to 8 sq.ft /person.

### Our main concern:

Reclaim the Urban/Rural Death space and use a simple way of disposing of bodies.

### Obstacles and supporting information:

With respect to India, there is no data of Funerals, Cemeteries list across states.
Mapping the places by visiting all nearby cemeteries and funeral grounds.

### Who is engaged in this concern?

People and the Government.

### What are the initial questions?

1. How to start the conversation where the death of a person is treated in religious form?
2. Sustainable methods of composting human bodies.

I happened to read Recompose, startup in the UK trying to address this issue.
