This Research has been carried out with [nshapiro](https://publiclab.org/profile/nshapiro#2/34.0/-118.0/BL1) & Solve Ninjas [Saujanya](https://publiclab.org/profile/Saujanya), [Taanika](https://publiclab.org/profile/Taanika2001) of [ReapBenefit](http://www.reapbenefit.org) , an organization that solves Local Civic & Environmental issues in India with Youngsters as part of Remediation Kit Project for Indoor Air Quality.

**Overview:** The
indoor air pollutants affect more than the outdoor ones. The concentration of
household pollutants exceeds the standard set for the outdoors. These
pollutants reach such a high level despite they are emitted in small volumes
but they cannot escape (subject to ventilation). Indoor air pollution is more
harmful and poses greater health hazards because on average a person spends
nearly 10 to 14 hours indoors.

**Introduction:** The term "Indoor" is subjective and it can be any of the following: _House (which is again subjective), Hostels,
Office space (including Govt. offices, Banks), Restaurants, Hotels, Cafes, Hospitals, Schools (all kinds),
Colleges, Religious Places, and Marriage Halls. The demography or location of a
place plays a vital role in increasing Indoor Pollutants. (Ex: Office space
situated near a Factory that emits smoke is viable to Breathe smoke air than
that of people living in Apartments away from 10km to that Factory). _Also,
when we say Indoor, the Sq.ft / sq. meter Area of the Indoor Space should also
be taken into account.

**Sources:**

_Common
Pollutants:_ Combustion, building materials, and bioaerosols are common Indoor pollutants. Radon,
asbestos, pesticides, heavy metals, volatile organic matter, and tobacco & industry smoke are considered major indoor pollutants in developed
countries & the combustion products of biomass fuels contribute most to indoor
air pollution in developing nations like India.

_Other
Sources from Fuels:_ The incomplete combustion products of biomass fuels include suspended particulate matter,
carbon monoxide, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, poly organic matter, formaldehyde,
etc., which have adverse effects on health.

_Combustion
of coal_: The combustion of coal results in the production of oxides of sulfur, arsenic, and fluorine.

_Sources
from Daily Usage Products:_ Pollutants such as aldehydes,
volatile, and semi-volatile organic compounds are produced from resins, waxes, polishing materials, cosmetics, Toilet
cleaning materials and binders. Also, more
use of Incense Sticks, Agarbatti, Camphor, Crackers during festival time significantly
cause discomfort in breathing and increase pollutants in indoor space. **Certain research suggests that overuse of
Electrical appliances like Induction stove, Microwave oven contributes to PM1.0 or less than that of PM0.5, PM0.3 ug/m3**.

_Biological
Pollutants:_ Biological pollutants like dust mites, molds, pollen, and infectious agents produced
in stagnant water, mattresses, carpets, Dust particles settled on top of the door
roof, Fans, Floorspace, Loft, windows, & humidifiers pollute indoor air.

_Other
Sources:_ The un-noticed & most significant source of
Indoor Air pollution is from **Plastics**
we use (Biscuit & Milk cover, Bags, Tetra-packets, Pens, Microplastics, etc.) which are dumped in public area that forms an **Open Garbage dump** in
nearby Land/ Lake area or in apartment Area that makes Dry & Wet Waste to get mixed results in the emission of Methane Gases.
This develops into huge landfill, resulting in affecting Indoor Air due to the wind, rain that enters the space. Sometimes, people staying near Factory Zones
might be affected. Coal, Paper, Cement, Heavy Electrical or factories where the burning of Substances exist that emits _Ozone which is
also an important indoor air Pollutant._

_Common
Across Any indoor space:_ In any Indoor Space, the contribution of
some of our Daily use products (Cosmetics, Toilet cleaning products, Incense
sticks, Agarbatti), some of Biological Pollutants (Dust from Fan, Door, Floor
space, Carpets) makes easily prone to Air Pollution and cause diseases.

_Unknown
sources_: Some of the pollutants arise from Water sources
also, The Algae that gets formed in Tap, Shower Head, Water Tanks, Overhead
Colling Towers and where warm water gets stored and contaminated due to the
presence of **_Legionella_**, an Algae. Another Factor is the presence of
Bacteria due to dust and pollen grains that affect Indoor Air.

**Diseases
due to Air pollution:** Conjunctivitis, Rhinitis, Sore
throat, Bronchitis, Asthma, Allergies, Pneumonia are common types
of diseases due to Indoor Air Pollutants.

**Conclusion:** The dimensions(Sq.ft area) of Indoor space, Ventilation, number of windows, kitchen spacing, Use of cooking fuel, Plants in homes, plays a significant contribution in reducing these Pollutants getting settled for a long time. Health, Education & work starts from the indoor space where we spend most of our time. Let us Take Action to Mitigate this Air Pollution Issue at Local level from our Indoor spaces.
