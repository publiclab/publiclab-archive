If the dump is cleared, it increases the ground water level thereby good for plants<br />https://mapknitter.org/embed/grab-age

What worked well:
1. Interfacing Pi-Camera is straightforward and easy with @warren Research note.
2. Thanks to Pi-builder for ease of connecting Rpi with Network (It works with Rpi 3 and Rpi Zero).

Scope for improvement:(Mapknitter tool +R-Pi)
1. when I opened all the Images /videos post mapping, the Date sequence for each file is not the same as the current Date/Time Zone. It showed me 2018.10.10 for the images or videos.
2. While Mapping, it was quite hazy when I typed the area of Location. It went blank for a while. This did not happen when I mapped the first time.![Map blank][2]
3. Key mappings are awesome. But it appears twice when I need one to use. Delete, Lock, overlap are great features to explore.
4. Image Sequencer code is great for me to identify/cross look into the image from PiCamera and check details easily. Need to explore more. This tool will play a vital part if we map Plant, Smoke, dust particles. ![dv][3]

Soon I will share detailed Research note on Map Knitter- UI, Hardware and everything.
