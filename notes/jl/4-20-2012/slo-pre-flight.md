Here's the rig setup I'm attempting to launch. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/j03lar50n/7095363693/" title="near_ir setup front by j03lar50n, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5349/7095363693_51e3c4aea3_n.jpg" width="180" height="320" alt="near_ir setup front"></a>

Aspiring balloon mappers - do your research on total setup cost. Helium is expensive.

But I went for it and bought some helium, borrowed the tank through the weekend.

Still doing some prep...laying out the materials..doing research on CHDK. *UPDATE* CHDK took me a while. Great help on this page http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/3-1-2012/triggering-a495-buttonusb 

I was struggling to get into the CHDK < Alt > mode - this doc pushed me over the edge finally http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/File:CHDK_UserGuide_April_2009_A4.pdf .. since I'm using Mac OS X, I simply used http://www.zenoshrdlu.com/clickpansdm/sdminst.html to load my SD card with the build I downloaded with same authors Acid.app, locked my SD card before inserting back in camera, enter Camera mode, press Playback (you should then see 'Alt') then Menu to see CHDK options.

After many hours of struggling with CHDK - I've learned to use the loader (already linked above)...I've also learned that my Transcend 4GB SDHC cards don't work w/ CHDK for some reason. I had a Toshiba and a SanDisk 2GB micro w/ sd-adapters that *DO* work...now off to buy new (and bigger) cards.

Bad news: The two places I was thinking of mapping are within 5 miles of our local airport AND right along the primary approach path. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/j03lar50n/6951354732/" title="5 mile buffer around McChesney Field by j03lar50n, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5038/6951354732_94c6d4d7c4_z.jpg" width="640" height="407" alt="5 mile buffer around McChesney Field"></a>

<strike>Looking for other vineyards around area...might capture the SLO Marathon on Sunday http://www.slomarathon.com/the-races/marathon</strike> I sent out some last minute requests and Ancient Peaks Winery gave me the go-ahead! The balloon took more helium than I expected, still waiting to see how much I actually used - and I unfortunately wasn't able to save any after the 2.5 hour flight.

I learned:
+ Think about building a shield. A couple times my camera lens got close to things.  
+ Tweak IR camera. My IR camera seems "too pink".  
+ Does IR camera use batteries faster? I put brand new batts in each camera - when I pulled down IR it was powered off for some reason.  
+ I was a little early in green-up season for grapes. Shoots were 2-4", small.
