I got a #babylegs question that could turn into a babylegs story:
If the babylegs can catch microplastics, can I put some on my washing machine outlet as a filter to trap the plastics? Or will the babylegs degrade and just contribute more pollution?

would the amount of stuff collected by putting a nylon on my washer outweigh the amount it might contribute. I wonder how long it would last before needing a change?
