Hello

  
I need to replace my kite and I'm interested in windless aerial photography.    Should I invest in new kites and balloons or should I buy a $500 drone?  

  
I believe I understand the benefits of KAP and potentially balloon photography.  I also understand the shortcomings of drone photography.   What I'm worried about is the ongoing expense of ballooning.  How much does it cost to fill a balloon to lift a light GoPro rig?

  
Any input would be appreciated

  
Thank you
