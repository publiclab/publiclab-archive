Hello

I've committed to teaching a series of introductory seminars on DIY and Maker ideas to a small group of sixth graders at a school with limited resources.  There are no curriculum goals. Just the need to inspire curiosity and know what is possible.

  
I'm considering rolling in an environmental monitoring component into the class.  

The school, in Salt Lake City, is adjacent to a river with some pollution issues.  We could build some [baby legs](https://publiclab.org/wiki/babylegs) to collect plastic pollution then building a few [community microscopes](https://publiclab.myshopify.com/collections/education/products/microscope?variant=8179759612011) to study our findings.

Do you have other project or curriculum ideas?  

Are there other affordable and easy to use Public Lab products we could utilize?

**

I have a design background and moderate maker and woodworking experience (and personal tools).  I have no experience with electronics. Also, I'm not a teacher.

The class will meet for an hour once a week for 8 weeks.  

We have access to a set of laptops, a simple offsite 3D printer and a high quality offsite laser cutter.  

  
Thank you for your help
