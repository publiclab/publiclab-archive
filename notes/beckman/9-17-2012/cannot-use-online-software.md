I think my profile is corrupt so I haven't been able to post good spectra, but did some experiments with chlorophylls in a standard quartz cuvette using the box spectrometer prototype.  One of the issues when doing this type of spectroscopy where absorption by compounds in the solution will result in reduced peak height is repeatability of measurements.  The ideal collection protocol would "blank" the measurement with the solvent or vehicle (in the case of my chlorophyll expt that was water or acetone).  Anyhow, just some thoughts.  I'll keep working on it.  I think I will create another profile so I can collect some data.  Any advice?
