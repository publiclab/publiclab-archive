I just built the spec using an old cardboard box.  Didn't remove filter from camera but still got some spectra from a CFL bulb.  I'm going to work on a cuvette/test-tube holder so that samples can be easily run through this without using big volumes.  I'm going to have my students build these this semester.  Great stuff.  Also, could maybe do fluorimetry with a few hacks on this design.  Might be able to use stage filters.  I have build some fluorescent microscopy tools using cheap plastic filters from a stage lighting store. Blah blah blah.
