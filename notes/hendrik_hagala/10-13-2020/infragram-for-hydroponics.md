Hello everyone,

  
We are building hydroponic gardens (example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84zh7XL15n8 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84zh7XL15n8")) for our homes and we are considering using infrared photography to support plant growth. Could anyone advice us if using infragram for hydroponic garden is useful? For example, would it help us to regulate nutrition and light output for plants?   

  
Many thanks for your help.
