Hello,

  
When taking a picture with the phone or tablet with the foldable spectrometer. I upload it and the picture is always processed as vertical. Even if you check or uncheck the "Spectrum is vertical" box. It will always insert the spectrum in the below manner. It does so on a desktop computer with windows 7, windows tablet with windows 10 and my android phone. I also found out that trying to use the "flip image" option does not do anything.

For a moment I thought that the picture was to big, so I made it smaller. But it still happened. So I included the java inspection.

With kind regards,
