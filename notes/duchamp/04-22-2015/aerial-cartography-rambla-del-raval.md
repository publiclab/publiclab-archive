In this ninth edition of the NOVUM Festival, researchers, scientists, artists, creators, students and entrepreneurs will take innovative science and technology out into the streets. Barcelona will become a huge citizen laboratory in which to experiment, build, learn, and enjoy a programme of actions and activities for all ages.

One of the highlights of this year’s festival is a project by Public Lab, a citizen science group that is mapping the Raval using small balloons carrying cameras in order to use the resulting images to analyse different aspects of the city. Public Lab will present the project at MACBA on April 25 as part of the EXPERIENCE MACBA programme, displaying and completing the maps of the Museum Atrium while analysing the results and drawing conclusions.
