I wanted to make Spectrometer myself and realized I do not have video tape box... so its housed in the box my cell phone came with.

<strong>Camera</strong>
I used Logitech C270. I guess it is less ideal for building Spectrometer since it does not have flat bottom. (I only realized this when adjusting camera angle after I built whole thing.)

Stand is taken off (it has screw on the side), and green light on the side of camera is sealed with electric tape.

I moved around quite bit to adjust camera position... ended up covering wide surface of the box with velcro tape.

<strong>Light Control</strong>
After I played with Spectrometer for few samples, I realized it often gets "too bright". This can be solved by moving light sauce further. But I was trying to make desktop stand (fixed position) for this Spectrometer, so added "Plug-in Lamp Dimmer" instead.

<strong>Stand (work in progress)</strong>
Camera cable is housed in T shape PVC connector for making Desktop stand in near future.
