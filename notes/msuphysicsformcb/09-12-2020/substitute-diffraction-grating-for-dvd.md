I'm setting up remote lab activities for pandemic-related online learning (university level).  I'm thinking of having the students purchase a diffraction-grating slide such as this.

![Diffraction Grating Slide-Linear 1000 Lines/mm 2x2"-Pack of 10](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31Su-DcPGjL._AC_UL320_.jpg)Can this replace the shard of DVD-R in the spectrometer kit?
