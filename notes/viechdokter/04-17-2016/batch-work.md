@Warren: Hi Warren, yesterday I used your serial capture macro to do another reproducibility test. It worked very well. Thanx again for your coding work! 

Afterwards I had to calibrate the spectra, one by one. Is there a way to put in a calibration spectrum copy command so that the spectra can be saved AND calibrated automatically?

Oh, and talking about making things simpler: perhaps you could add beside the CSV button another button for XLSX or ODS format?
