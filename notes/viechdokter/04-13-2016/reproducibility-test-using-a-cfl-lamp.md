Another test whether the PLab spectrometer 3.0 can achieve reproducible data curves.

This time I took a CFL (because of the nice narrow light bands in the spectrum) and put it 2 meters away from the spectrometer to avoid over-exposure. Dark room (not what you think!) with no stray light. Spectra taken between 12:54 pm and 14:58 pm, roughly in 10 minute intervals. I put the curves together in a gif animation that you can see here:

[![CFL_reproducibility_animation.gif](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/514/large/CFL_reproducibility_animation.gif)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/514/original/CFL_reproducibility_animation.gif)

**As you will notice, there are intensity differences between the captures but the main peak wavelengths are pretty stable. Best seen at the red curve peak to the right.**

All 10 pictures are calibrated using the same curve. If you want to check the CSVs the spectra are saved under the names "Reproducibility test CFL #" (1 to 10).

The lamp was a "Corso CTU 20W" with a very bright but annoyingly flickering light.

PS: if you can't see the gif animation try IrfanView.
