I know there are a lot of good programmers out there and maybe one of you can help. Yesterday I tried to take a series of spectral captures with the same setup every 5 minutes over a period of 2 hours. I wanted to test if there would be any light shifting. Problem was, I started to watch StarWars and missed captures during about 20 minutes. So now my question: Is it possible to write a program that does automatic captures at certain points in time?
