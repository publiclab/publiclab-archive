I went into the garden today and - believe it or not - the sun was shining. Again. So instead of photographing ants or chasing the dog around the garden I took my spectrometer out and photographed _plants and spectra_. Here is the first:

[![white_flower.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/454/large/white_flower.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/454/original/white_flower.jpg)

A nice white spring flower. And here is its spectrum:

[![sunlight_reflected_off_white_flower.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/455/large/sunlight_reflected_off_white_flower.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/455/original/sunlight_reflected_off_white_flower.jpg)

Very bright but not overexposed this time. As mentioned before, when it gets overexposed in green and red the yellow will come out much stronger. But its a pretty smooth spectrum over all colours with a slight dip at 590 nm.

The next "pictures" I took of green leafs of grass:

[![green_grass_small.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/456/large/green_grass_small.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/456/original/green_grass_small.jpg)
[![sunlight_reflected_off_green_grass.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/457/large/sunlight_reflected_off_green_grass.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/457/original/sunlight_reflected_off_green_grass.jpg)

Great. We have proven that the main colour in a green grass spectrum indeed is green. Probably not a surprise to most of the scientific world, but as long as no one measures it everyone just has to guess or believe it... We have a broader range of blues but a higher peak of red than of blue. Perhaps there were a few yellowish leafs. Thats the problem with the setup. You can't know for sure _what exactly_ you are taking the spectrum of when you just point and shoot _somewhere_.

And now for a nice yellow flower:

[![yellow_flower_small.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/458/large/yellow_flower_small.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/458/original/yellow_flower_small.jpg)

Isn't it pretty? We should get a lot of yellow from that one, shouldn't we?

[![sunlight_reflected_off_a_yellow_flower.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/459/large/sunlight_reflected_off_a_yellow_flower.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/459/original/sunlight_reflected_off_a_yellow_flower.jpg)

First thing you might notice is the flickering "waterfall" image. There was some wind that let the flower tumble a bit. But for the curve I used one of the brighter lines in the middle. 
The second thing you _should_ notice is that there is almost _no yellow at all_! Where green and red curves should overlap to give us some nice yellow the curves are strictly separated! We have a very strong blue and green section but only a little red and still it adds up to a strong yellow in the photo. Perhaps I did not properly aim at the yellow part of the flower? Okay, lets take another spectrum. This time with a stillstanding flower and aimed right at their yellow heart:

[![sunlight_reflected_off_a_yellow_flower_2.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/460/large/sunlight_reflected_off_a_yellow_flower_2.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/460/original/sunlight_reflected_off_a_yellow_flower_2.jpg)

That's more like it! Green and red dominating, adding to yellow. Seems it _was_ a targeting problem. 

**Improvement proposal:**

To avoid that we would need a kind of "sights", preferably a direct photo through the slit and a "two picture monitoring image" on the computer screen. One image of what the spectrometer "sees" and one image of what it measures, in real-time, of course. And it shouldn't raise the price of the spectrometer too much. A second web cam inside? A prism to part the light? Let's challenge the tech wizzards here!

Okay, last but not least a nice blue flower:

[![blue_flower.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/461/large/blue_flower.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/461/original/blue_flower.jpg)

In fact it is a bit violet, so in the spectrum we see the dominant blue and a good amount red adding up. Interesting here is the blue "plateau" on the red hand side of the spectrum. Again: shouldn't the diffraction grating send the blues to the left and the reds to the right?
