It continues to use an old cal as reference after I create the new calibration then hit the button use this calibration at the bottom of the screen after creating and saving the cal. After doing this, the action shows a blue lock which would confirm that this newly created cal is the reference calibration. however, when I go and then do a new run, after saving the newly created file says that it needs calibrating, and I have to use the copy calibration feature to apply the new cal. Any useful tips?
