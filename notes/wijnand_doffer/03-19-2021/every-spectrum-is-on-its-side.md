Dear,

  
I am trying to do something with Spectral Workbench for a couple of days now and I am getting stuck whatever I try.

When I manually upload an image (because taking a picture with the rear camera of a smartphone isn't supported) the webpage says a spectrum is succesfully created but the image is horrible... Instead of nice bands from left to right my spectrum is from top to bottom and stretched out to the sides and cramped to a narrow band vertically.

Can somebody explain what's going wrong?
