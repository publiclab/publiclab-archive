After following all the steps I downloaded the CameraFi2 app on my Android smart phone, but it is unable to recognize the USB camera. The camera is connected with an USB OTG cable. It works on my laptop, so the camera is not broken. Other apps that promise to open USB cameras also do not work. Is a specific version of Android required?
