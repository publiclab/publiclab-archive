For some time now I have been using Peter Lynn 3d kites for aerial photography.  

There are a number of reasons why I am so keen on this particular kind of kite.

The Peter Lynn 3D is a good and steady flyer with mid to strong winds. As the line is attached directly to the frame there is no angle to adjust for the wind speed. On a box kite like this I usually place the camera within the frame so that it is protected by the structure of the kite in case it crash lands.

I use a bike camera clamp to attach the camera to the frame. As the spars of my kite are much narrower than a bicycle handlebar I pad it  with cotton wool and duck tape for a good grip.  

We should place the bike clamp on the front spar, a bit higher than the point where we tie the kite to the line. If the camera looks forward we can have panoramic views; placing the camera looking backwards will get perpendicular pictures which can be used on their own or to produce orthomosaics.

I use a kite about 2.20m high which is enough to lift a Canon Powershot S100 with medium winds. With stronger winds we can place a second camera on the rear spar of the kite in the same way as the first one.
