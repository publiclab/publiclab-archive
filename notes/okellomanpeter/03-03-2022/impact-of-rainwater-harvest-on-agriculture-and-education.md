### Introduction:

Water
is very important for daily today activities. For all our domestic use,
industrial use, farm use, construction and animal use. There is no substitute
for water, (Ssewakiryanga 1996). The Uganda constitution of 1996, article 29,
clause 1 state that; "every Ugandan is entitle to clean and safe water". Hence
the government is responsible to make sure everyone has access to clean water whenever
they need it. The government of Uganda through National Water and Sewage
Corporation (NWSC) ensures that water reaches all Ugandans through pipe water.
Also National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA), ensures that all water
catchment areas in Uganda is not encroached by investor, business settings and
construction companies as well.

The
rural communities in Uganda is profoundly affected by inadequate water supply
and access to clean water. Reports from UNICEF Uganda and National Drought
Management Authority Uganda (UNDMA) indicates that when the long rain is gone,
numerous parts of eastern Uganda especially Kaliro District, experiences
extreme dry spell causing low agricultural harvest and bout 90% of health
related cases are due to unsafe drinking water, also noted by (USAID, 2018), that
50% of the health center visits are related to unsafe water supply.

### Our main concern:

This
research seek to examine the impact of water harvest in rural agriculture development and education sector of Kaliro
District in Eastern Uganda.

### Obstacles and supporting information:

Despite
all the efforts that the government of Uganda through Ministry of Water and
Environment (MWE), NEMA, NGOs and CBOs. Kaliro District has limited water
supply and also lacks storage management of water, community lacks unclean and
unsafe water for agricultural use, learning institutions (children travels for miles looking for water) and domestic water usage is miserable, contaminated water is also a threat to
their health and to their animals, there is competition from the sugar
factories which consumes a lot of water and at the same time polluting the environment, there is no infrastructural
development, agricultural yield are always low due to low water supply, the
water catchment areas are being encroached by the local who grow rice, (UBOS,
2018).

### Who is engaged in this concern?

The
Non-Governmental organizations in Eastern Uganda has been providing water aid
to the local communities through construction of boreholes, water dams, and schemes to support and elevate
poverty in Kaliro District, UNNOF (2019). They also highlighted that water aid
in Eastern Uganda and in Kaliro in particular has been increasing steadily
since 2010 to 2020\. One of the key issues worrying the donors are the high rate
of poverty, high level of school drop out especially girls due to shortage of water, under-developed infrastructures, poor agricultural yield yet there
exist all opportunity for the development eco-system of the communities. More evidence
also suggest that water management highly contributes to the development of a
society, this could explain why there are so many NGOs proving water aid yet
the community still struggles to score success in agriculture sector, and education sector.

### What are the initial questions?

What is the relationship between rainwater harvest and agricultural production in Kaliro District in Uganda?

How does waterwater harvest influence education system Kaliro District in Uganda ?

What is the relationship between climate
changes and agricultural projects?
