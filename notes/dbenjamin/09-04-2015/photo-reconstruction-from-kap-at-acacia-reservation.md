###What I want to do
We decided to check out [Acacia Reservation](http://maps.clevelandmetroparks.com/url/Nrg), which was an old golf course that has been allowed to grow freely for the past year. We also wanted to test our new helikite using the Saturn V aerial rig. 

###My attempt and results
We used Mode 2 (9,9,8,6,3, slow) on a Canon S100 RGB Camera mounted on the Saturn V w/ Skyshield v2.041.

I discovered afterwards that the camera was only taking a photo every other angle, so we did not have enough photos to input into ICE, but I still tried to perform a 3D reconstruction using [OpenDroneMap](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/OpenDroneMap). I was unable to create a textured mesh, but still produced a decent dense point cloud:

You can download the original ply file [here](https://github.com/cleveland-metroparks/acacia-point-cloud/) and view it using software such as Meshlab.

Here are a few photos from the flight:

###Questions and next steps
Why did the camera only take photos every other angle? Is it a CHDK setting, or something in SkyShield? 

We would like to fly acacia a few more times to get a full reconstruction. It would be interesting to see how the land has changed since the Metroparks acquired the property.
