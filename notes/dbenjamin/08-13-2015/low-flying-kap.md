Today we attempted a flight over the Cleveland Lakefront Nature Preserve in Cleveland, Ohio. We used an airfoil kite, the Saturn V camera rig, and a Canon S100 with Color IR. Wind speeds were probably between 5 - 10 mph.

We were unable to get high in the air today due to the lack of wind speeds and concerns about nearby aircraft. We have been having bad luck with wind nearly every time we have tried to get out and fly since we got the Saturn V. I also noticed after the flight that the left plastic guard was showing in each of the photos. I guess it had slipped forward too far. I think I will put a little tape down to prevent it from shifting. 

The Saturn V worked very well, despite the other problems we experienced.
