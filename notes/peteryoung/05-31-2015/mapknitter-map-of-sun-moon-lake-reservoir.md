The main purpose is to observe the Sun Moon Lake Reservoir sedimentation situation, these photos were taken by UAV in April 8,2015, there are two points to note following:

1. If there are no photos, that mean the shore without sediment deposition;
2. Some pictures are not vertical shooting, resulting in elongated object, and the actual size and shape would be some differences;
3. with the second point, the white is shore; the khaki color is silt.
