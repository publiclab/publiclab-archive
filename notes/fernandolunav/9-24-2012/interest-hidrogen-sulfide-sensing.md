Hello There!

I am really happy of seeing a lot of creative people involved in "citizen science". I want to join the Hydrogen Sulfide project and start it in Bogot√°, Colombia. I already read the documentation, however I want to find out if you guys have some tips to start the project in a community. 

Also, I have website in Spanish where I would like to link the PLOTS basic info in Spanish....can I just go and do it or do I need any especial permission (intelectual property issues)to publish PLOTS info y the website? www.cientificamente.net 

Thanks a lot.

Fernando.
