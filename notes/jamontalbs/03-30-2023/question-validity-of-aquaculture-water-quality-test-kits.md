Hello everyone!  
  
Giving context in the Philippines, aquaculture (whether freshwater or saltwater) water quality test kits (with brands such as API) are recently being used as an affordable alternative for environmental monitoring, particularly in sewage/wastewater effluent sampling and/or performance monitoring of wastewater treatment plants. Given the possible limitations and challenges of these tools most especially on the quantification of water quality parameters, can these tools still be considered to be used on a wider scale of water quality analysis for environmental monitoring? Do we have any initiatives to be considered first before using these tools in further understanding the physio-chemical characteristics of either freshwater/saltwater ecosystems, in pursuit of an open-source, nature-based, science-based and pro-people approach of environmental conservation?
