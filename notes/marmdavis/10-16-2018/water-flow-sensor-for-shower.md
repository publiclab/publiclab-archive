Last year, my iCons team at UMass conducted an experiment with the goal of trying to reduce students' shower times. We built a device that displayed time and water consumption that the students would use in the shower and have to manually press start and stop buttons. Through the conscious behavior of physically pressing the buttons and watching their water consumption go up, we found that we were able to reduce shower duration by about 40%. 

  
As a part of the Makerspace 597M course here at UMass, I am trying to modify this device so it can collect the control data as well as the experimental data. I was hoping to attach the device to the pipe of a shower-head and have a sensor pick up the vibrations/sound the water makes as it flows through the pipe as an indication of water usage. The device has to be small enough to fit on a shower head and also be unnoticeable to the public, as well as run on a source of power that lasts for at least a month. Does anyone know how to go about doing this?
