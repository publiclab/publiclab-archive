Map and Kite Education
at MLK Charter School
Lower 9th Ward, New Orleans Spring 2013

   As neighborhoods throughout New Orleans continue to rebuild and undergo the process of change, Groundwork New Orleans and other organizations are interested in documenting that change with the help of the youth and community members of these neighborhoods. 
  
  The process of recruiting our teacher and class was fairly organic, we were already working with some of the high school students and met with a 4th grade teacher who was interested in our idea.    We worked directly with Mr. Moorman to create a schedule and brought in volunteers in to help with the task of making and flying kites. 

   Our first effort with a 4th grade class was very enlightening.  I showed a very short and simple slideshow about Maps and Cartography.  
 
   Asking questions about how maps are made, how they are used and why they're important.  The students had some great insight, specifically with one slide which shows an old map of the Caribbean and the Eastern Seaboard of the United States.  In the far Northwest corner of the map there is only blank space.   Our conversation lead to the understanding that mapping isn't just a drawing of a mountain or the sea, its a representation of known territory, of knowledge itself with embedded patterns and trends. 

   We looked at Google Earth, which is a great tool to allow kids to conceptualize digital mapping space.  Asking for a place they have been/would like to go on vacation then zooming to the Great Barrier Reef or Houston, allowed our students to help understand the difference between a static paper map and a dynamic GIS map.  Of course, the technology itself is a big draw.
