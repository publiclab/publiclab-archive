### I wanted to measure fluophore response to excitation with the supplied laser diode pen. The fluophore is disolved at an uknown concentration in destilled water and has optimum excitation with green light and responds also quite well with blue light. Fluorescence is orange/red and easily visible with the naked eye as well defined orange beam traversing the liquid. However due to the low light emission it is not picked up by the spectrometer. Possibly due to alignment problems with the slit of the spectrometer entrance. What diffuse light source could be suggested within the blue/green range to excite the fluophore and how to better the sensitivity of the web cam?

###Background story
detection of fluorescent aptamer sensors in the field ("point of care") using inexpensive consumer goods technology like smart phones and public labs open software.
Thanks

Hi Jeffrey
thanks for the response and apologies for my late reply..
I use as a fluorophor Atto 595 of unknown concentration but possibly in the range of 100 - 10 nmol/l. At the time it was used as an optical/fluorescence standard against  td-tomato expressed in the cells of a genetically engineereda fluorescent biosensor.
My measuring set up is the spectrometer in the card box orientated either with parallel or perpendicular orientation of the collimator slit towards the laser beam.
Pics of my set up.

the green fluorescence in the left bottle is from Uranium glass splinters

The laser beam shows orange fluorescence to the naked eye transversing the liquid but the camera seems to pick up mostly the green from the laser reflected. 
The last pic is with blue excitation from the blue laser pen supplied with the kit.

two more pics demonstrating that there is orange/red fluorescence from the fluorphore:

the last one taken with a red photographic filter in front of the lens (HOYA R=4/O-58). It totally blocks the geen laser light used for excitation
