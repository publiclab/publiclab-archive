# Boston PLOTS Meet Up - Tidmarsh Farm

Event Information Here: http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/tidmarsh-farms-meetup
RSVP on Eventbrite: http://bostonplotsfall2012.eventbrite.com

This is the Event Page for Boston's PLOTS Tidmarsh Meet Up

There have been a few requests for weekend mapping workshops on the listserv, and so in an effort to create a more active arena for skill sharing and collaboration in the Boston and greater-Boston area, Jeff and I thought it would be fun to organize a meet up -- similar to the recent LEAFEST in Vermont but more informal and for only half of a day. 

Our proposal for the first (of hopefully many more) Boston PLOTS meet up is Saturday, November 17, 2012 at Tidmarsh Farms in Manomet, MA. We'll have more logistical information soon, but let us know if you're available on November 17 to meet up at Tidmarsh Farms for a skill share/mapping session and potential potluck. Feel free to add your name below. 

Date: Saturday, November 17, 2012
Location: Tidmarsh Farm, http://tidmarshfarms.com
Time: 12PM - ?

To dos:
--Decide on equipment needed for skillshare
