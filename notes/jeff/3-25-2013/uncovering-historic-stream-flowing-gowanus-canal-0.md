We hope to uncover the flow of a historic stream into the Gowanus Canal through a combined effort between the [Brooklyn Atlantis](http://www.brooklynatlantis.com) robot and the [GLAM Conservancy](https://gowanuscanalconservancy.wordpress.com/category/glam/) balloon.

We suspect that the historic [Bergen stream](http://brooklynhistory.org/blog/2012/02/06/map-of-the-month-february-2012/) is connected to the Bond Lorraine sewer line,  discharging at [RH 35](https://www.flickr.com/photos/51802375@N04/7084239127/in/set-72157629540684629) during heavy rain events.

This idea will be tested by placing dye in the underground stream, and using the robot's [underwater camera](https://publiclab.org/sites/default/files/2013_03_11_13_14_52_BUOY01_A.png) to capture sewage footage along with the  balloon's [aerial camera](http://gowanuscanalconservancy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/8275971513_ea5c0ec205_o.jpg?w=436&h=581) to capture from above any potential changes in color from the tracing dye.
