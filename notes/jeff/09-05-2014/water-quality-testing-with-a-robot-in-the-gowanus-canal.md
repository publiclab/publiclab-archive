This is one of the robots used in the [Brooklyn Atlantis](http://www.brooklynatlantis.org) project.  We've recently fit it with YSI 600r water quality sonde, which gives us a few measures of water quality, such as pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, etc.  Both the water quality data and the GPS are logged as the robot moves throughout the canal.  We've also put a DSLR camera with an automated pan-tilt mechanism on top to get some interesting photos.

###My attempt and results
Overlaying the water quality data with the position data, we can see some interesting trends;

Noting that the flushing tunnel was on at the time, we see a higher dissolved oxygen as we travel towards it (located at the top-most part).  The water from the flushing tunnel is also a bit saltier and cooler when compared to the rest of the canal (as expected)

As [Eymund](http://publiclab.org/profile/eymund) has pointed out, there is a somewhat unexpected spike in the dissolved oxygen right around where the Union St. bridge is.  We'll be trying to figure out what is going on there.


Below is an example of six photos stitched together into a single panorama.

With the correct viewer, one can pan the view, similar to google street view.  We've posted the image on [360cities](https://www.360cities.net/image/gowanus-canal), but as I check it now, it doesn't seem to be loading.

###Questions and next steps

What's with that anomalous spike in dissolved oxygen? 
We'll be doing more water quality testing in the coming days and analyzing the data.
