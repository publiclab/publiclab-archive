Our group is working on a soil and air (testing) citizen science project as an outcome of a Federal court ordered community project (Tonawanda Coke v USA) in Tonawanda, NY . The study has gone awry ( by a local University ) and now we are trying to get the project back on track. Our first step is to form a technical advisory committee. Any suggestions on how to do this, what kind of people we should be looking for, etc is appreciated. thank you
