## What I want to do
Put together an open source, inexpensive and easily replicable soil sampling tool kit. 

## My attempt and results
Our group, [Citizen Science Community Resources](https://csresources.org/), recently collaborated with Public Lab to design an easy to put together (open source) soil sampling tool kit so folks can sample their own backyard for hazardous chemicals.
We've only attempted this once. Its really not rocket science..

## Questions and next steps
Do you think there is a real need for something like this in communities ? 
We are in the process of tweaking the soil sampling instructions and contents of the tool kit, and will; hopefully roll it out in the next few weeks.
Our expertise  mainly is in the interpretation of the results and what to do with the data ([using data for real tangible outcomes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUuEFy5GwYY)

## Why Im interested
We want to empower folks impacted by industrial pollution by providing them with information on how to put together a soil sampling tool kit, teach them how to use it, help them interpret the results and what to do with the data to demand environmental justice.
