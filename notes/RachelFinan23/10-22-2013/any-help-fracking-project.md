Hey, I am new to this site and I have been given a interesting thesis project at college. My supervisor has asked me to test the accuracy and precision of the public lab spectrometer against a bench on we have in the laboratory here at the college. He has asked me to try and see if it is possible to identify possible fracking contamination using the spectrophotometer. Now i have spent a few weeks trying to research this, and so far I have come up with nothing!! I have looked at the possible components that are used in the fracking process (mainly the fluid used) that couse cause water contamination, Methane dissolved in water being the obvious one, but that is analysed through gas chromatography. I have access to a gas chromatograph so if anyone out there knows of a way i could analysis dissolved methane in water with the spectrophotometer, i could compare the two methods. But at the minute im very lost and losing hope :(

All suggestions are welcome
