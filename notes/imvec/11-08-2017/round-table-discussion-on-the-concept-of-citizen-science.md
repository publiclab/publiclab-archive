###When, where, what 

Tabakalera International Center for Contemporary Culture in Donosti, Spain.

Friday 10, November 2017

[Hirikilabs](www.hirikilabs.tabakalera.eu) is participating in this year's science week with a round-table discussion on the concept of citizen science in which we will be joined by Antonio Lafuente, whose intellectual point of view defends the dissemination and democratization of knowledge, without it being exclusively reserved for the experts.

Another participant will be [IMVEC](https://imvec.tech) (The Institute for the Monitoring and Surveillance of Contaminated Areas), a collective that investigates technologies to allow for survival in adverse environments. Their work revolves around the potential of collective intelligence.
