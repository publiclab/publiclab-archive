###What we want to do
Develop some safe areas inside the [Minetest](https://minetest.net/) game to learn about pollution events with kids. Then think and build solutions.

###Our attempt and results
We're setting up a private server and organizing meetings to investigate the potential of the voxel engines like Minetest or Minecraft to let children get close to high contaminated areas like landfills, refineries, open pits...
We want to focus on detection, monitoring and further imagining and building solutions for each environmental concern. The potential of the voxel engines is awesome.

###Questions and next steps
We are now testing some toxic stuff within the game and setting up a private server at https://play.imvec.tech (nothing there by now).
Next step will be organizing a meeting with our children and friends to test the first map and games/dynamics like "dump and seek" (in the images)

###Why we're interested
We want to investigate the potential of inmersive gaming in didactic processes related to environmental concerns and pollution events.
