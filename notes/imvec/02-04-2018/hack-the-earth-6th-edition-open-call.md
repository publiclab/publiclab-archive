We want to explore the possibilities offered by free software and hardware technologies to the rebellion of the earth, of the streets. We want, in short, that the Hackeja la Terra be an occasion to meet us again, to continue weaving networks, to create passageways, open roads and break walls, while we build bridges between activist circles and between activists and society in general.

We invite you to think critically and practically the current political moment with workshops, talks and debates. We believe that all this can not be done if it is not from the local and popular level. Therefore, in this edition we bring the hack back to people, where it emerged from and where we believe it is now more necessary than ever.

Throughout February we will confirm activities and publish the info on our website
