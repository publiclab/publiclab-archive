### Our attempt and results
We've previously worked on the [Odor Log](https://publiclab.org/notes/imvec/04-06-2018/online-odor-log-v1-0), a grassroots reporting tool for bad odor events.

What we want to do is to compose as many surveys as needed for different kind of pollution events: air, water, soil, sound... 

At the moment we've put together two surveys: one for Air pollution and another one for Water pollution. POIs on the map are disposed in two colors.

### Questions and next steps
Nexts steps: first and foremost, collectivelly review and compose the surveys to make them more accurate and complete. So please, burn the comments section with your suggestions and critics.

Secondly: outreach and foster it's use by affected populations. 

### Adding a launcher to your phone 
You can also create an Android or iOS launcher for your mobile phone. Just visit the survey url and bookmark it using Chrome or Safari. Click on "add to home screen" or " create launcher". You'll get a new launcher on your Phone so you'll be able to report an event just with one click.
