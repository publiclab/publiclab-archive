###What we want to do
We'll try to develop a DIY system to collect a relatively standard “fresh air” during the initial autocalibration of an air quality or gas sensor.

###Our attempt and results
During the next four days in the city of A Coruña (Spain) and on the framework of the [Ateneo Atlántico de Prototipado](https://ateneo.gpul.org/) (Atlantic Prototyping Popular Laboratory) a group of makers, coders and artists will gather at the Domus Science Museum to develop some tecno-social prototypes including this first approach to a standarized/low cost fresh air collector.

###Why we're interested
The vast majority of air quality sensors depend on the asumption of a first autocalibration using “fresh air” and working with that reference as the “zero” of the sensor.
That first calibration depends on the air conditions of the place where the calibration is carried on. We have to assume that this first “autocalibration” would never be possible in cities like Beijing or Madrid where the presence of high proportions of different gases is already known.
We are not talking about the calibration of the sensors in relation to professional gas detectors but the initial autocalibration of the sensors in relation to their own technical specifications.
