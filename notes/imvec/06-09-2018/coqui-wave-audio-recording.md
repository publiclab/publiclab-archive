## My attempt and results
After adding a [3.5mm Audio Jack](https://publiclab.org/notes/imvec/06-08-2018/adding-a-jack-to-the-coqui) to the [Coqui build](https://publiclab.org/notes/ashkaya/09-17-2016/build-a-coqui-a-simple-water-conductivity-sensor) we've begun recording waves. Here is a recording of Bezoya bottled water plus an adition of the same water with a teaspoon of salt.

To record the signal we've used a handy audio recorder. It's also possible to record it directly with the computer using the Free Open Source Software Audacity. Follow this instructions to [select the input device in Audacity](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/tutorial_selecting_your_recording_device.html)

## Questions and next steps
Use a known conductivity solution to use at the begining of each recording.
Analize the sprectrum of the signal using Audacity.
