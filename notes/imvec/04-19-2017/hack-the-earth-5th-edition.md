From 14 to 16th April took place the fifth edition of the Hack The Earth event at the Ecoindustrial postcapitalist colony of Calafou ([geolocation](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/41.51136/1.70241))

The event was divided in three areas:  
**Hacking Area**, where free technologies with the arts and sciences get mixed.  
**New Structures Area**, for sharing experiences of cooperativism, networked work, self-employment, etc.  
**Materials Area**, for the experimentation with the reappropriation of traditional materials and discover new ones that can help in self-organisation.

**THE CAMERA**

The Anoia river close to Calafou is one of the most polluted in Europe. During the next weeks we will be working toghether with the inhabitants of Calafou on a self sufficient open source timelapse camera to monitor the river.
