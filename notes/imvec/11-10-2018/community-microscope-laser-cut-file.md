### WHAT
Community microscope file, ready to be cut with a laser cut machine or by hand. 
The file has three stages: sample area, camera stage and a raspberry pi stage at the bottom.

### HOW
**1**. Download the .dxf file.

**2**. Depending on your machine you'll need to dimension the file to 30x13 cm.

**3**. Cut it and assemble


Ready to cut file → [RPI microscope DXF file](https://gitlab.com/imvec/dumping-can/blob/master/microscope-RPi.dxf)

Inkscape editable file → [RPI microscope SVG file](https://gitlab.com/imvec/dumping-can/blob/master/microscope-RPi.svg)
