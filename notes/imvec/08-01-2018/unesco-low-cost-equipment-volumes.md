### UNESCO low cost equipment for science and education 
We have recently found online these two volumes full of low cost equipment with lists of parts and schematics:

[**VOLUME 1**](https://ia801500.us.archive.org/35/items/low_cost_lab_equipment/low_cost_equipment_Vol_1_UNESCO.pdf)

[**VOLUME 2**](https://ia801500.us.archive.org/35/items/low_cost_lab_equipment/low_cost_equipment_Vol_2_UNESCO.pdf)
