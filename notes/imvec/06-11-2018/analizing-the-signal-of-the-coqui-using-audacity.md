### What I want to do
Determine the frequency of the generated wave of a [Coqui device](https://publiclab.org/wiki/coqui).

### My attempt and results
AUDIO FILE → <a href="/i/25188"><i class="fa fa-file"></i> LS_51372.ogg</a>

After [recording the signal](https://publiclab.org/notes/imvec/06-09-2018/coqui-wave-audio-recording) from a Bezoya bottled water and adding some salty water to it we've imported the file into Audacity. Getting this general wave.

### Analizing a part of the wave
We've selected 1/2 second of the lowest signal (Bezoya water). You can do it directly on the timeline using the cursor or at the bottom of the interface.

[![selection.png](/i/25195)](/i/25195)

Once selected, on the top menu go to "Analyze → Plot spectrum". For our low part of the wave we've got this curve.

For the high part of the wave (the salty water) this is the result.

[![high.png](/i/25197)](/i/25197)

Audacity has a lot of different patterns of analisis and options. Play around with it.

## Questions and next steps
Use a know conductivity product and... modify the coqui with a potentiometer to "tune" this known conductivity signal to a musical note?¿ Would it be possible?
