## When, where, how

14th February 2019 from 18:00 to 20:00

Hangar Audiovisual Arts Research and Production Center

Emilia Coranty 16 - Barcelona

We'll guide participants through building their own microscope with affordable materials: cardboard, bolts, webcams, and tape. It takes only 15-30 minutes to build, and plugs into a smartphone or laptop. We'll look at water and plant samples from nearby sites, and talk about ways that using DIY science tools can lead to meaningful discovery, citizen empowerment and the selfdefense of the territories.

Every participant will end up the workshop with It's own microscope.

**Price â‚¬25 including materials.** 

Inscriptions at imvec@tutanota.com

If you can not afford the price, contact us anyway and we'll manage the situation ;D
