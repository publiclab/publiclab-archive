Hello guys! I just receive my new preassembled Infragram Pi Camera. I connected my laptop to the wifi network generated by the camera without any trouble, but I can not see any live video. The pi.local is continously refreshing trying to load images, but nothing happens.  
  
I tried with different power supplies and diferent laptops and smartphones (Android), but I got the same problem.  
  
Can you help me please?!![image description](/i/43053.png "picamera.png")
