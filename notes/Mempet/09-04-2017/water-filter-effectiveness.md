Hello, I am creating a water filter using Moringa Olefiera. I need to test the effectiveness of it. I already have a TDS meter, but I can't afford a turbidity meter. What are some other ways I can test the efficiency of the filter? How can I test the effectiveness of a water filter on reducing turbidity?
