I am trying to learn to build a low cost affordable near infra red spectrometer for spectral wavelengths ranging 1000nm to 1800nm . I would like to analyze and understand transmission spectrum for various materials in these wavelengths. This is for my self hobby / educational purpose . I do not have any technical background in this topic area other than school/college physics concepts :-)
