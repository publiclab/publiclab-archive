## About me

My name is Fatimah Akanbi, and I'm
a full-time front-end developer with 2 years of experience. During that time, I've had
experience using Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap, Figma, and WordPress
in creating responsive websites and mobile applications.

This
may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my second year as a
developer has been a huge milestone for me. This is because I had no real
experience doing web development --- and not much programming experience in
general beyond some basic C# training I got from minoring in a few computer
science courses back in university. I also didn't have a computer science
degree since I graduated with a degree in Pure and Applied chemistry.

My transition into Tech is basically to use technology in making life easier for
others. I am a problem-solver and derive so much joy in doing so.

I have worked at bulb Africa as a frontend developer where we develop
life-changing finTech applications and also volunteered in mentoring kids in my
neighborhood on coding basics. I have also undergone a few boot camps and online
coding classes such as GADs2021, LSETF/USADF training Bootcamp, and DPD schools to
perfect my coding skills as a front-end developer.

I am strong-willed and do not shy away from responsibilities and tasks.

## Project description

**Designing a new full-screen user interface for [Infragram.org](http://Infragram.org)**

The Infragram project brings together a range of different efforts to make Do-It-Yourself plant health comparisons possible with infrared photography. [Infragram.org](http://Infragram.org) enables people with Infragram-modified cameras to upload photos for analysis and conversion using techniques like NDVI (used in satellite imaging analysis). It also allows for live streaming from a modified webcam. This project will overhaul the UI of Infragram to be full-screen and create space for new features like multiple resolutions of video, dragging in a recorded video instead of a still image for conversion, and pop up panels with Q&A, tips, tutorials, and more, so that they can feature more helpful guidance text.

### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

### Problem

1\. Poor UI of [infragram.org](http://infragram.org) Home page ![image description](/i/45766.png "revamb_of_home_page.PNG")![](alt=)

2\. Poor CSS styling (Padding, Font size, font color, font-weight, letter-spacing, etc) on the header in [https://infragram.org/sandbox/index.html](https://infragram.org/sandbox/index.html)

![image description](/i/45770.png "poor_css_styling_in_UI.PNG")

3\. Absence of Cross-browser drag-and-drop feature and
Welcome Modal box for better user-experience.

![image description](/i/45772.png "cross_browser_usage.PNG")

4\. Helpful links hidden within unnoticeable buttons in
the UI of [https://infragram.org/sandbox/index.html](https://infragram.org/sandbox/index.html).

![image description](/i/45771.png "poor_css_styling_in_UI_link.PNG")  
The URL embedded in **_Camera_** Link highlighted above should be in an **about** button instead as it contains information about the infragram camera and more of its usage.

  
### 

### \*\*Proposed

Solutions\*\*

Enable Cross browser drag and drop Feature using HTML5,bootstrap4 and vanilla Javascript

Resulting UI

  
![image description](/i/46069.gif "ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif")

  
1\. Redesign the [infragram.org](http://infragram.org/) page to a full screen with a toolbar, solicit and
incorporate input from the user community taking to cognizance features from bootstrap 4\.

2\. Add enough spacing and styling to links in the UI for a
better user experience.3\.
Move the Q&A feature into a Help menu, allow cross-browser
drag-and-drop on the entire page instead of just selecting an image, and add a popup "Welcome" modal box which guides your first few steps
based on the tutorial at [https://publiclab.org/n/15075](https://publiclab.org/n/15075 "https://publiclab.org/n/15075") and
more at [https://publiclab.org/infragram#Activities](https://publiclab.org/infragram#Activities) to
improve
the layout of [infragram.org](http://infragram.org) .

4\. Add the URL embedded in _**camera**_ link
In the Welcome Modal box proposed above (3) as it contains basic information on
how to use infragram.

5\. Embed the sandbox URL instead in the _**About
Infragrammer**_ Link, as there are no features in its present
embedded URL.

6\. Add a background tutorial video on how to use infragram on the [infragram.org](http://infragram.org)
Home page.

### Experience

I attended a hybrid
coding Bootcamp program- the bulb-Africa Fellowship, where I worked on personal
Projects, was Introduced to the tech meetup scene, learned soft skills needed to be a
better team player at work, and mastered every aspect of skills required to
become a professional programmer. My stacks are as follows:

Front-End: React JS,
JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootsrap, Figma, WordPress

Back-End, Tools &
Methods: Node JS, Git, GitHub, Chrome Dev Tools

Professional: Remote
Pair-Programming, Teamwork, Mentoring, Problem-Solving, and effective communication.

I have built over 40
projects and contributed to both open and closed source projects, this can be found in my GitHub repo [https://github.com/akanbifatimah?tab=repositories](https://github.com/akanbifatimah?tab=repositories)

---------

### Teamwork

\_During my fellowship coding boot camp, we were given
the task to complete a group capstone project which involved collaboration
between Product Managers, UI designers, and software engineers remotely. We
engaged in stand-ups to discuss the progress of our work and \_took turns in working as either a navigator or a driver while sharing
our screens. _This always pushed me hard to complete my task and
taught me how to effectively communicate my progress, blocks to my team members,
this has generally improved my performance as a software developer and ability
to work with people from a diverse range of cultures from any part of the world._

---------

### Passion

\_  
My experience as a chemistry student has helped in shaping my awareness of the impact of environmental hazards on the existence of life. I completely resonate with PublicLab's mission of "_Pursuing environmental justice through community science and open technology_". I am passionate about how infragram would help farmers determine the best planting seasons for their produce thereby saving them loss. I am also passionate about how PublicLab creates tools that are low cost, easy to use, and built through public participation and collaboration and how these tools have supported a large network of practitioners across various fields of science.

### Audience

\_  
Looking at making infragram more user-friendly as a DIY tool for Agriculturists, environmentalists, health scientists, and any individual/community interested in making the environment and its components safe and healthy for all.\_

### Commitment

\_I understand this is a serious commitment and confirm my availability to work as a full-time summer job giving it all my time and dedication. I intend to work 9hrs a day (Ihr tea break/lunch) / 5 times weekly during the duration of this internship. With my past experience as a software engineer and my breakdown of tasks/ weekly goals, I am confident I would complete the project. \_
