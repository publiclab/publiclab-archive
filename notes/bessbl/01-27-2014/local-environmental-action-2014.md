Local Environmental Action is a joint effort of Toxics Action Center and MCAN, the Massachusetts Climate Action Network. 

Toxics Action Centerâ€™s mission is to work side-by-side with communities, providing them with the skills and resources needed to prevent or clean up pollution at the local level.  Since 1987, we have organized over 700 communities across New England to put together the plans and strategies to effectively solve the problems they face. In doing so, we train neighbors to not only defend their health and safety, but to think strategically and come together for proactive, positive change. In our 25 year history, we have helped win hundreds of campaigns to protect the health of citizens and neighborhoods across the region. 

MCAN is a statewide organization that coordinates the work of locally organized groups across Massachusetts fighting the climate crisis. We have a large and vigorous community of 46 chapters (in a fifth of MA communities), hundreds of members, and others who communicate, network, and share information related to climate action.

We hope to see you there!
