# Mapping rugged coastal environments with a Raspberry Pi and a balloon?

**The short**:

I'm a geoscience graduate student. For my project, I need high-resolution, quantitative topographic data.

I want to collect these data using an inexpensive, DIY solution.

If you can help with:

1. setting up a Raspberry Pi Zero for time-lapse photography, ideally in a raw image format;
2. ways to collect these data in rugged coastal environments;
3. ways to make these data quantitative (i.e. spatially accurate);
4. processing image files with free photogrammetry software to create high-resolution 3D models;

please get in touch! All help and advice will be much appreciated. If you would like to get more involved with my project, let me know.

Ultimately, I want to create a step-by-step tutorial on Public Lab that will enable others to collect high-resolution, quantitative topographic data suitable for scientific research.

**The long**:

I'm a graduate student at the GFZ in Germany: [http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/home/](http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/home/).

My project is all about how the properties of materials in a landscape (e.g. rock, soil, sand) interact with the different processes acting on that landscape (e.g. river incision, landsliding, wave quarrying). My approach involves finding ways to quantitatively compare the shape of a landscape with the substrate properties.

In order to do this, I need high-resolution, quantitative topographic data. My chosen field sites are rocky coastlines, which can be challenging to map.

To collect these data, I'd like to use an inexpensive, DIY solution, and then share my method and data with others. This could be a new method, or a new application of an existing method, or just an existing method.

Here's a list of everything I've bought so far:

1. Raspberry Pi Zero
2. 9V AA battery pack
3. UBEC 5V 3A step-down converter
4. Raspberry Pi camera module V2
5. Raspberry Pi Zero camera cable
6. USB SD card reader
7. Raspberry Pi power supply

I'll be doing everything with a Mac; my programming language of choice is Python.

The simplicity of pole aerial photography is very appealing, but I don't think it's suitable for my purposes; kite and balloon aerial photography are better suited. However, I don't think photographing a cliff will be easy with a kite. So, at the moment, I think a balloon rig would be the best. In order to get a bit more control over the position of the balloon at lower elevations (and in windy weather), I was thinking of a setup like this:

In order to make the data spatially accurate, I was thinking of using something like this:

This will probably work to improve accuracy in the xy-plane; maybe not so much in the z-direction.

I also need to work out a good way to make a lightweight, adjustable mount for my camera.

As mentioned above, if you can help with:

1. setting up a Raspberry Pi Zero for time-lapse photography, ideally in a raw image format;
2. ways to collect these data in rugged coastal environments;
3. ways to make these data quantitative (i.e. spatially accurate);
4. processing image files with free photogrammetry software to create high-resolution 3D models;

Thanks very much in advance!
