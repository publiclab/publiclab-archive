I put this here as a problem, which is relatively common in rural China, I haven't think of any appropriate technology that the local community could take action towards this problem...

This landfill is in Weifang, Shandong, China.
The textile factory dump their waste to rural area nearby. Burn it without any pretreatment or protection. The film was taken yesterday.

The mayor of the village sell the public land use right to the factory privately, the villagers complain for it all the time, but no result. 
Also in this area, the factory discharge their sewage into underground secretly (told by some villagers), thus they could avoid paying for the sewage treatment fee. 
Not only environment problem, the mayor benefits a lot from land selling, and has a very good relationship with upper government. The inequality happened for years, the residents feel they can do nothing on it.
