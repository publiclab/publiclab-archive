# Pearl River Monitoring in Guangzhou

###What I want to do
I paddle every week with Guangzhou International Dragon Boat Club in Pearl River. The water quality is very bad, and is classified as "-V" according to Chinese Surface Water Standard, which means it does not have any function other then shipping.
But we have to practice every week here, since there are no other options for us. We want to record the water quality changes, and try to raise awareness for water protection though this. We hope this data will be useful for scientist in the future (no scientists are interested in this so far ^_^ )

###My attempt and results
We made a 6-months monitoring plan: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sT8M4cvF7z7aOA0HCOYdG2NA3YH5XAxtnrJsBQSQPWY/edit?usp=sharing

We made a recording form:

And test the river every week during practice, and record result here:

###Questions and next steps
I are not confident with the data quality, also a little bit afraid of the outcome after we publishing the data (we didn't publish it in China currently).
I hope some scientist could help us with this also, I want to have deeper understanding of the data, and how will the water affect our health. 
Also, we are trying to build a water monitoring device (an Arduino based datalogger, with the help of @LaurenED209 ), so we could easily track the difference of the water quality when we paddle at different site.
