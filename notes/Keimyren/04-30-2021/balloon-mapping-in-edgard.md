My class and I did an mapping of West St. John High School. We sent a balloon up in the air 500 ft. off the ground. The balloon was on a string. My job was to hold the string and not let it get away and set a timer for 10 mins. Also they had a camera on the balloon to get pictures of the school from 500 ft. up. I had on gloves to not get burned by the string because the wind was taking the balloon. The gloves was hard on the outside by soft in the inside. We set a timer for 10 mins and 15 mins for the balloon to get up in the sky.
