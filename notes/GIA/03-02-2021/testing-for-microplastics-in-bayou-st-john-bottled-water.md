Steps:

1\. Grab some of the bayou water you will be testing with.

2\. Pour the water into micro plastics filter.

3\. Then, check the water filter in the stereoscope.

4\. When looking in the stereoscope you must count all of the micro plastics seen in the filter.

5\. Record the data found.

6\. Finally, compare how many micro plastics did the water have throughout the weeks.
