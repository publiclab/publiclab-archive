I am working on studying signalling in plants. Currently trying to make a portable system that can measure intensity of fluorescence in plant leaves infused with different fluorescent dyes. 

Any ideas which kind of webcam or camera might be suitable for such application. I have been experimenting with rPi camera since more than a month. But apparently, picamera looks too much programming demanding.

Any suggestions, thoughts, brain storming - most welcome.
