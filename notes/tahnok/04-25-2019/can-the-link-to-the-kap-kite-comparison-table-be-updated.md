Hello!

  
First time contributor, but for reasons I can understand new accounts can't edit the wiki. This is my attempt at trying to contribute

  
The link on https://publiclab.org/wiki/kite-mapping to http://www.kaper.us/basics/comparekite\_R.htm no longer works because that site appears to have succumbed to link rot (RIP). Can it point to the archive.org version instead?
