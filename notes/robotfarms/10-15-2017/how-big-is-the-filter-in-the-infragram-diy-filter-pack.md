Just wondering how big the filter is in the DIY infragram filter kit? Is it a big sheet, and you cut your own like in the first picture, or is it just a small piece big enough for one camera?

  
I am looking to install one in an openMV camera for a machine vision weed detection/spray system. Ultimately I will be converting quite a few, so the filter size will determine how many packs I buy.

  
Thanks
