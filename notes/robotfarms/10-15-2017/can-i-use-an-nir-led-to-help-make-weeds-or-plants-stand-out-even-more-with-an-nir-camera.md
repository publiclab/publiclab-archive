I am playing around with a project that uses an openMV camera with the IR filter replaced with the infragram filter pack to detect weeds in a fallow (bare stubble) paddock of crops. Would it help if I added artificial lighting by using some NIR LED's to bounce some NIR light off the plants? Or am I wasting my time?

  
The goal is to make the plants stand out even more, and create a consistent lighting for the camera to view.  

  
The light and camera module would only be about 50-60cm from the plant/ground.

There are quite a few different wavelength LED's available to choose from in the NIR range, is there a prefered wavelength or just something over the 750nm ish mark?

  
Any opinions or information would be greatly appreciated.

  
Thanks

Adam
