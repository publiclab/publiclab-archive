Almost all low cost air pollution PM sensors use the poorly documented Chinese devices from PlanTower - and are very happy with it - which is great. However, if one wants to design a long term, high quality (as much as one's pocket can afford) public air monitoring stations, are there any better alternatives?

  
I am developing one such opensource device - YAAPM (Yet Another Air Pollution Monitor) called [Breathe2](http://smalldesign.in/category/breathe2/). This is based around a [Sensirion SPS30](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/particulate-matter-sensors-pm25/) which is twice the cost of PlanTower units, but is from a reputed sensor manufacturer with guaranteed 8 years continuous operation life. All is great, but PM10 results are abysmal (also observed [here](http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/aq-spec/field-evaluations/sensirion-sps30-evaluation-kit---field-evaluation.pdf?sfvrsn=18) in comparison to reference instruments). The kind people at Sensirion have been very responsive on many issues (helped solved all) but refuse to acknowledge this PM10 issue.

  
Question: has anyone used Sensirion's SPS30 before? Are there any tricks around it to give realistic PM10 results? Are there any good alternatives to PlanTower?
