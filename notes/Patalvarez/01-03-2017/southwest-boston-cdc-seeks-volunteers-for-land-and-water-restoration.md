Southwest Boston Community Development
Corporation (SWBCDC) is a non-profit organization serving Boston's Hyde Park
and Roslindale neighborhoods. Current
projects include affordable housing preservation and development, green space
preservation and development, environmental justice and transit equity along
the Fairmount Commuter Rail Line.

**Green Team **- Southwest
Boston CDC's Green Team
employs youth ages 15-25 to restore Hyde Park's city-owned urban wilds and to
educate residents and businesses about caring for the local environment. The Green Team works at 5
urban wilds, removing trash and invasive plants, and building trails. The Team has
planted over 100 native trees, and engaged over 50 community volunteers.
Through the program youth learn about environmental science and climate
change, and explore careers in these fields.

**POHWER** - SWBCDC is part of the Fairmount Greenway Task
Force, a partnership of CDC's and community based organizations developing open
space within Â½ mile of the Fairmount train line. SWBCDC has prioritized two highly
deteriorated open spaces for restoration: 1) the West St urban wild, a 2 acre,
city-owned woodland in Hyde Park's business district; and 2) the DCR owned
former Doyle Playground close to the Riverwood Shopping Plaza in Mattapan. Both
sites sit on the Neponset River in neighborhoods populated primarily by
low-income residents of color. Our goal is to restore these sites and create a continuous
1/3 mile footpath along the river bank between the two. The Neponset
River is polluted with PCB's following years of industrial use. In September
2016, volunteers hauled 14 tons of debris from the Neponset including car
parts, shopping carts and construction materials.

Since many residents, especially newcomers, were not aware of these
deteriorated and contaminated open spaces SWBCDC recently hosted a series of
meetings to discuss environmental justice concerns. Residents formed a new
neighborhood committee,_People of Hyde
Park Wanting Equal Representation_ (POHWER), to focus on housing and environmental
justice concerns.

**Southwest Boston CDC seeks volunteers
who can assist the Green Team and POHWER with the following:**

****

\*
Provide water and soil tests kits
and train youth and community members how to use them

\*
Find a lab that would allow our
youth to bring samples, and allow youth to participate in the testing

\*
Identify local colleges and/or environmental
businesses that would be willing to provide short (1-2hr) workshops for our
youth
related to urban woodland ecology and the critical role of urban woodlands,
history and health of the Neponset River and its impact on the community, climate
change, renewable energy, or related topics. 

\*
Introduce us to other community
groups that have successfully advocated for river restoration.
