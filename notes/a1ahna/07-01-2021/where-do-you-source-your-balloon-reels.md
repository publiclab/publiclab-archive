Hey y'all!  We're having some difficulty sourcing kite reels seeing as Shanti Kites is temporarily closed.  Does anyone have suggestions on alternative sources where I can buy pre-wound reels with 1,000 feet of 110# Dacron line on a 8 inch hoop winder, or something similar?  Tagging in all of my brilliant kits predecessors for help!  @cfastie @eustatic @patcoyle @matthew @bronwen @warren
