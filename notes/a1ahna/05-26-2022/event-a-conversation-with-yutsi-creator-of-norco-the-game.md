Join us for a conversation with Yutsi of the game development collective Geography of Robots, creator of the award winning game [**NORCO**](http://norcogame.com/).  Norco is a sci-fi Southern Gothic Adventure that immerses the player in the sinking suburbs and verdant industrial swamps of Louisiana's petrochemical hinterlands.  [Following the gameâ€™s release on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1221250/NORCO/) this March, many individuals in the gaming community were suddenly introduced to the present day dystopian environments of coastal Louisiana and Cancer Alley.  The New Yorker article â€œ[Mapping Climate Grief, One Pixel at a Time](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/mapping-climate-grief-one-pixel-at-a-time) begs the question: What does it mean to love a landscape that is engineering its own disappearance?  This event will seek to indirectly answer that question through a colloquial conversation between two friends who were raised on opposite banks of the Mississippi River.  


**Please RSVP to this event using [this form](https://forms.gle/gWfYjgfijnyTPutM8).**

If you have questions for Yutsi regarding environmental game development or growing up beneath the flare of an oil refinery, please attend our weekly Open Call call a few hours before the event, or submit your questions via [this form](https://forms.gle/gWfYjgfijnyTPutM8).
