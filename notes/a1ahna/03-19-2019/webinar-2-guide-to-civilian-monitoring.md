This video is part two in the "Civilian Monitoring of Pipelines in Louisiana" series. These webinars were created and compiled by Alahna Moore as a part of Public Lab's _oil and gas accountability fellowship_. The first two videos are intended to connect the origins of oil and gas development in the Gulf Coast region to the environmental degradation and land loss experienced in the last half of a century. Videos two and three will provide resources for conducting pipeline related research and step - by - step training for civilian monitoring, photographic data collection, and reporting environmental concerns to government regulators.

Each video in this series examines a different facet of the problem in Louisiana so that each can be viewed individually or in order. The purpose of this video series is to educate Louisiana residents on the history of our landscape and how to use laws such as the clean water act and resources such as the national reporting center to demand accountability from oil and gas companies when they illegally act outside of their permits.  
  
While these videos are specifically catered to the situation in Louisiana, the tools and techniques discussed in these videos are applicable to environmental struggles across the nation. Many of the state-run resources provided here have similar counterparts in other areas.
