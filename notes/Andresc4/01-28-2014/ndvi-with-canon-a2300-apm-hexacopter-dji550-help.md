Hello, I'm new on the community, i have been reading the site for a few weeks and i just decided to join the community to share the project that I'm working on, basically i want to start using areal photography to control some fields. I have experience in UAV Drones ( multirrotors, and now im working on a small plane ). I work with APM2.5 + Mavlink. The drone its working just fine, I was able to complete successful missions, now Im stuch with the NDVI calculations

I bough 2 Canon A2300, i remove the Ir filter and added a Rosco2003 Infra Blue, bouth with CHDK and a remote usb trigger. I have some photos that i took from my firtst mision,,, im not over a real field, so there is no much vegetation to analyze

I follow the steps on this video....

but im not quite happy with the results... and i having a hard time to align the images in photoshop! The cameras are new, same settings, same picture from the same angle, and the lens distorcion seems quite different. I thougth I made a mistake and I left one of the camera with more zoom, but i double check and still, cant align the images. Already try using PTgui, but still no success.

I would like to request some help regarding this topics...

A) Is there any opensource software to align the 2 images one over the other one ?
B ) Is my NDVI calculation correct ? i don´t see the results ... is there any software that realizes this task easily ?

###Questions and next steps

Regarding new steps on the project,,, im would like to use 2 exact RF cameras used for FPV, and use 2 different Vtx and Rtx to receive the video on a laptop, with 2 different usb capure card i think it will be possible to write a shader and to get the calculation in realtime... im a vvvv user (vvvv.org)

Well thats all, i hope to get some help from the forums, if any of you need help on vvvv or APM please let me know, or write me on my persona email ( mynewpixel.com <-- here is my email )
