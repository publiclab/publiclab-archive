###What I want to do
turn an infrablue and RGB into a false color composite image as seen in Cfastie's page.

###My attempt and results
multiple pics looking good, planning to use gimp 2.6

###Questions and next steps
need to know how to use Cfastie's gradient with his .lut file

###Why I'm interested
Theres so much potential in remote sensing.
