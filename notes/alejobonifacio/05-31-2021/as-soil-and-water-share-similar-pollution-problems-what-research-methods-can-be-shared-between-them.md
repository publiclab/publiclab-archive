Hi everybody! my name is Alejo. I participate in a community science project called "Water watchers" ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWVomD1jsuo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWVomD1jsuo "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWVomD1jsuo")) in
which we see the pollution that one of the most important rivers in
central Argentina is suffering. We use DIY microscopes and a mobile app
as a tool.

We would also like to measure some contaminant in water and, if
possible, it can also be measured in soil. The river brings very
polluted water and we want to know how much it affects the surrounding
soil.

We need some method to measure organic pollution (sewage effluents), or heavy metals that is cheap, since we work with low-income schools.
