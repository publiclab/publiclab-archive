## Some things that happen in the last tree months :balloon:

\###New people :man:

We met Alejo Bonifacio (me :grimacing:), the new Water Research Curation fellow. To know more about him follow this [link](https://publiclab.org/notes/alejobonifacio/05-24-2021/mi-post-de-presentacion)

\###New wikis :iphone: :national\_park: :chart\_with\_upwards\_trend:

Now there is a [wiki page about AppEar](https://publiclab.org/wiki/appear-ciencia-ciudadana-en-rios-lagos-lagunas-y-estuarios). An environmental assessment tool for aquatic environments. You just need a mobile phone with android operative system.

\###Community calls!!! :loudspeaker:

**We did not one, _two_ community calls. The first in english and the other in spanish**

Both community calls were about tools and projects to study aquatic environments with amazing speakers:

Joaqu√≠n Cochero is the creator of [AppEar](https://app-ear.com.ar/) and talk about these wonderful tool and project.

Micaela Prieto, bring to us a DIY microscope and teach us how [Vigilantes del Agua](https://www.instagram.com/vigilantesdelaguaunc/?hl=es-la) use this amazing tool to detect the bioindicators present in freshwater environments.![DIY microscope](https://publiclab.org/i/44321.png?s=o)

In the english community call, the attendance was not to high, but we take the opportunity to record it. You can see it in the next [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nYC-TwszqE&t=204).![CCall.png](https://publiclab.org/i/44325.png?s=o)

For the second one, the attendance was really high. 29 people were present in the Spanish community call. So, the projects and tools presented in the previous community call, on this occasion were the focus of numerous questions, ideas and thoughts. Thus we met with projects like [Cyano](https://www.instagram.com/proyecto_cyano/?hl=es-la). They want to make eutrophication an environmental problem of maximum attention.
