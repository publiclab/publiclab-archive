THE CRY OF THE SUQUÍA RIVER is a documentary that is a boat trip crossing a 32 km path that allows you to see at each stop, to connect with life experiences on various socio-environmental realities. The language is Spanish with English subtitles.

## A river extremely polluted
As already discussed in the issue brief [link](https://publiclab.org/notes/alejobonifacio/11-19-2021/aguas-cloacales-en-la-cuenca-del-rio-suquia) the sewage in the Suquía river Basin is a big problem in the second most populated city in Argentina. This is a big source of problems in the environment, health, economy and society. In this film you are gonna see how the river is becoming polluted, obstructing the flow of clean water that is biodiversity and the health of the population. Garbage, plastics, toxins, waste, sewers, believing that the river cleans everything. Nothing further from reality.
