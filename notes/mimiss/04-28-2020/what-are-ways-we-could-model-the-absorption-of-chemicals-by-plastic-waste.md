# What are ways we could model the absorption of chemicals by plastic waste?

I'm interested in ways to engage folks on the role of plastics in moving pollutants through an ecosystem through the absorption of chemical pollutants followed by the ingestion of that plastic by marine animals. I've read [articles like this one][1] and [more academic chapters like this][2], and would be interested in a more tactile or visual way to communicate this, similar to the ways that watershed models can help us to understand erosion and water flow.

I'd like to think on:

 - What kinds of tools might we need for a demonstration like this?
 - Could this be communicated via plastic and a simple dye?
 - What are ways that you could detect the absorption rate of various plastics if not visibly?
 - What type of time scale would this need to happen on?

Thanks for your thoughts y'all!
