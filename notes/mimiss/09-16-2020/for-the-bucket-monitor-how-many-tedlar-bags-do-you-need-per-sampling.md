We're working to bring the [Bucket Monitor](https://publiclab.org/wiki/bucket-monitor) into the Public Lab Store and need some more information on how many bags would be useful for each kit.

I'd like to know, when you're going out and sampling, how many bags do you use? Do you tend to take more than one sample per-trip? If you purchased a sampling kit, how many bags would be useful?
