I'm looking for affordable ways to stain microscope samples to increase visibility. What are good alternatives to more expensive and harder to source dyes, like hematoxylin, eosin, carmine, methylene blue, methyl green, and the like?

  
Suggestions I've seen include things like ink, beet juice, plant based dyes, and food coloring.

  
What qualities should I look for in potential dye alternatives (pH, charge, solubility, etc)?
