### Needs

_I will certainly need the help of google when I get stuck or don't understand something enough. I will also need the help of my mentors and colleagues. We're are a team!. What resources will you need: people, documentation, literature, sample data, hardware if applicable_

### Experience

_I have been learning to use Figma for UI  design over the past few months. I also have learned HTML and CSS and I am able to use them to create webpages. I am still battling a bit with Javascript and React but I am getting a hang of it. _

---------

### Teamwork

_I have always loved working in teams, right from high school, I always do my best to carry out the work assigned to me and help others in need. I have found out through working in teams that I love teaching others what I know and it also helps me remember things better. __During my time at Middlesex University for my undergraduate studies, I often worked in teams and was good at organizing team meetings.__I am also self-sufficient as I like having personal time to be with my thoughts and get creative. ___

---------

### Passion

_I love the fact that Public Lab helps people of underrepresented groups, or those that do not have enough financially, are able to have access to infrared cameras. What about our projects, and Public Lab, interests you? What are you passionate about? Open science, environmental justice?_

### Audience

_I would love to help people of all groups with the things I create or contribute to especially people who are underrepresented. So I will do well to make sure my designs are accessible to as many that need it as possible. _

### Commitment

_I completely understand that a lot of time has to be dedicated for this internship and I am willing and ready to do so. I have already dedicated time for it. The project also falls within a time period where I am free. __
