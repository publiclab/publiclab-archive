# About the project:\*\*

I am a community mapping fellow working with asylum seekers and refugees from a conversation club in Nottingham to map the city centre from above. The mapping process allows them to build a clearer picture of their new city and new home. This project is in collaboration with urban growers based in Nottingham who will select sites that are useful for mapping existing community gardens, allotments and green spaces, as well as establishing ideal future sites for urban growing. The final maps will be presented at various community festivals and events over the summer.

**What do I expect to achieve using MapKnitter?**

To stitch together a series of aerial photographs and build a current and clear picture of green spaces, derelict spaces and unused land sites in Nottingham. I expect to encounter both difficulties and successes when using MapKnitter, and that I can report and feedback on these for the development of the software. I expect these resulting maps to have a high enough number of pixels that we can zoom in and print them A3/A2\. I want to achieve a unique map which can be used as an urban greening plan - as well as open-source material for anyone interested!

**How do I see this map relating to other people's maps around this area?**\*\*\*\*

I see these maps being able to feed into the bigger picture. It's so interesting to see what and why other people have chosen to map an area - and even more interesting when it is local to yours. I hope to connect with local maps and projects - anyone in Nottingham, reach out!
