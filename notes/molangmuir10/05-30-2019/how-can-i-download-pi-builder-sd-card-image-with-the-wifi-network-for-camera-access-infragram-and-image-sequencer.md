***UPDATE!! This worked it just took a very long time for the wifi to connect! (About 25mins)***





I followed the link to the public lab pi builder site. I then followed the download link to GitHub: https://github.com/publiclab/pi-builder/pull/53.

![Step 1][1]

I followed jywarren's download instructions through to gitlab. (I have never used gitlab before so this is probably where I went wrong!)

![Step 2][2]

![Step 3][3]

I downloaded the artifacts zip entitled 'camera_web' which gave me a zip file and an img.zip.sha256 file.

![Step 4][4]

I unzipped the other and used belenaEtcher to flash these onto my SD card.

![Step 5][5]

I waited 10 mins from plugging in my raspi for the network but nothing showed.
I've attached screenshots of my process - any ideas where I've gone wrong?
