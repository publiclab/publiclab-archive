I am wondering if a micro SD card configuration in a Raspberry Pi 1, used for transmitting live data to the internet from a Dylos Air Quality Monitor, can the same configuration on the SD card that is currently used in a Raspberry Pi 1 work the same in a Raspbarry Pi 3?

We are currently using a Dylos Air Quality monitor to monitor air quality near a construction site on the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire Campus. The Dylos has been attached to a Raspberry Pi 1 and it is supposed to transmit live air quality data to the internet. However the setup has never worked in the time we have been using it. The Raspberry Pi was always on and functioning but data was never transmitted, due to water damage the Raspberry Pi 1 recently broke so we are upgrading to the Raspberry Pi 3 and were hoping to find out if the same micro SD setup will function in the new Raspberry Pi.
