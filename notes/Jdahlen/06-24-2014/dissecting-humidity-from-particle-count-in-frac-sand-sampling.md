###What I want to do
Dr. Crispin PIerce (UW-Eau Claire) and I, Jonathan Dahlen (UW-Stout), are researching into particulate matter 2.5 and 10 around frac sand mines. What we are looking to do is create a device that can sample both PM 2.5 and 10, but also collect measurements of temperature and humidity. 

###My attempt and results
We are currently using direct reading instruments (Dusttrak 1 and 2, Dylos), but humidity is playing a factor in our results and we would like to eliminate that problem so we are able to just collect particles. 

###Questions and next steps
We are wondering what some of the people from Public Lab have for thoughts or ideas on our project. 

###Why I'm interested
We would like to add to the array of inexpensive tools in monitoring around frac sand facilities.
