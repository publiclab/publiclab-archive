###What I want to do
I wanted to create a new module for SpectralWorkbench, to guide the users through testing, and also help them document their work in a well-mannered fashion. This also attempts to reduce manual intervention as much as possible, by automating several steps.

###My attempt and results
With the help of Jeff, I could identify the common steps that the users go through while attempting to test any material. This was done by reading many notes posted here about testing. This was quite time consuming and at the end of this exercise, I had a list of several steps that appear in almost every test.

So, I went a step further ahead, and created a HTML mockup of what the interface should ideally look like (a lot of tweaks, and coloring needs to be done, but this is the basic idea), and this is how it looks:

This would be the recording interface for the procedure, where the user can choose to record a live testing experiment, or can choose to use the existing data (may be an already existing spectra on SWB, or just images, or any other format for that matter).

The text area would be like the one we have on the PublicLab.org site to post the research notes. This would let us to include images, have markups, links etc.,

And, to showcase our content, we would have a dedicated page, probably like this:

###Questions and next steps
I would love to hear your feedback on the interface, and let us (Jeff and me) know what could be done better, so that I can re-iterate this and probably work on a beta version that I plan to release soon.
