sir I am researcher in Punjab agricultural university Ludhiana, Punjab (India ). I have bought your camera for NDVI calculation of the corn field for my project work.
1) I used infragram for image analysis but after uploading image of IR camera and select NDVI for point and shoot camera option on red filter then I select HSV mode.then I obtain red and yellowish image but after that how will I know the NDVI value. please guide me and tell me full process so that I am able to find NDVI.
2) secondly I want to know the about that how I can take image automatically after ever 2 second interval of time without pressing the shutter key since we are installing IR camera on drone take images at high altitude and take images.
3) third thing I want to know about camera viewing angle on both the axis, so that I can fly my drone according to the field of view. I have 1.4 acres of field & 36 plots of size 16*10 metres & I want to calculate NDVI of each plot... 
     please send me all details as early as possible so i can able to find NDVI of the field and complete my project work.... waiting for your reply...
