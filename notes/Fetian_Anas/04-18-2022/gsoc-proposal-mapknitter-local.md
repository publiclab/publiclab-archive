2\. Add a "drag image onto the page to add" feature to the Leaflet.DistortableImage demo.   

3\. Allow current map state to be exported to a downloadable "distortableGeoJSON.json" to JSON format and Add local saving of maps, via localStorage.

4\. Allow map initialization from a "distortableGeoJSON.json" format which auto-places the images.

5\. local full-res map exporting.

First-time contribution

\*  Comments, to show overall community involvement: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/11061#

- Closed PRs: none at the moment but I am hopeful of having one very soon.

Experience  

I believe in doing practice more than studying while learning something new.  I am a web development enthusiast. I love spending countless hours working with JavaScript and Ruby on Rails. HTML and CSS.   

Teamwork

I have an experience of working as a team lead in one of the student subchapters at my university  

Passion

Today, we live in a world facing the immediate threat of climate change and global warming. My generation will be in positions of power in a few years, and the fight against climate change has to be stepped up. For this, information is vital. I believe that every person on the planet should have easy access to accurate, high-quality information, and PublicLab helps achieve that goal. This is why I am motivated to make this product better and more beneficial for the community.

  
Audience

This project is aimed to create and export maps locally at https://mapknitter.org from a static HTML/JS-based page even offline. and adding some features like a geocoding search box, drag and drop image drag , allow to export maps to format json and allow initialization from it.It will help the public lab community members to experience a better organization of contents and will make their experience a bit more smoother and easier to use.

  
Commitment

I don't have particular conflicting schedule in the period of GSoC and I can work full-time.
