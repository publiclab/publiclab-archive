The [Philadelphia Chapter](http://publiclab.org/wiki/philadelphia) will be co-hosting our second Balloon Mapping Workshop on April 22nd, 2015 as part of [Philly Tech Week](http://2015.phillytechweek.com/). The event is co-sponsored by [Azavea](http://www.azavea.com) and the [GeoPhilly](http://www.meetup.com/GeoPhilly/) meetup community. Event information can be found [here](http://2015.phillytechweek.com/events/geophilly_balloon_mapping_launch).

Registration for the event is $5 and will be done through [GeoPhilly](http://www.meetup.com/GeoPhilly/events/220196293/). If you would like to volunteer and help during the event, please contact [Sean McGinnis](http://publiclab.org/profile/SeanKMcGinnis).

There will be an [Image Stitching and Camera Rig Party](http://www.meetup.com/GeoPhilly/events/220196484/) later that evening at [Azavea](http://www.azavea.com). There is no charge for the evening event, materials for you to build your own camera rig and pizza will be provided (_and who doesn't like pizza?!?!_).
