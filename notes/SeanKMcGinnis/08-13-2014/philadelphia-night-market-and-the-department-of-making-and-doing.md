###Background

The [Department of Making and Doing](http://dmdphilly.org/) will be setting up a couple tables with work completed by the Sensors Research Team and flying a balloon with the [Raspberry Pi camera rig](http://publiclab.org/notes/SeanKMcGinnis/03-12-2014/raspberry-pi-camera-rig). Come on by and check out some of the components we have been building and ask questions about balloon and kite mapping.
