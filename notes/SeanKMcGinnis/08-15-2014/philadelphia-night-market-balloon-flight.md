Last night was the [Philadelphia Night Market](http://thefoodtrust.org/night-market) and we were asked to come down with the [Department of Making and Doing](http://dmdphilly.org/).

It was difficult to fly the balloon given the number of power and trolley lines, but we did have a good block on [38th Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lancaster+Ave+%26+N+38th+St,+Philadelphia,+PA+19104/@39.9602761,-75.1969306,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c6c654428677d3:0x208940224c0082c1) to let the balloon up.

The Department of Making and Doing were building their Market Tower, a 21' tower built from nothing but equal length pieces of wood and zip ties. It was amazingly sturdy and was built relatively quickly. The balloon was up and down a number of times and drew the attention of a number of people wondering what we were doing, why we did it and how they could do it. Hopefully the [quick start guide]([https://publiclab.org/sites/default/files/BalloonMappingQuickStartGuide1English.pdf) and [preflight checklists](https://publiclab.org/sites/default/files/Balloon%20Mapping%20Pre-flight%20Checklist%20&%20Packing%20List.pdf) will help them out.

Since I wasn't going to be able to get the balloon too high, I used a camera with a fish eye lens to try and capture more of the block in each shot.

But out of nowhere, a really bad rain storm blew in and we had to take the balloon down pretty quickly and the market emptied out pretty quickly. But it was a great night none the less.

####Lessons Learned

ALWAYS double check your wires ties - I was bringing the balloon down pretty quickly due to an incoming storm. As I got it in my hand, apparently I had a sharp point one the top most zip tie and it punctured the balloon

When walking down an intercity street with a 60 cu/ft helium tank, be prepared to be stopped repeatedly and questioned by almost every level of law enforcement official.They were very polite, but they definitely wanted to know what I was doing.
