## Project description

I will be addressing the calendar and events integration part of [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/milestone/10](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/milestone/10) and some parts of [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/milestone/13](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/milestone/13).

Currently, only PL members can RSVP on events. When an event is organised, not every new comer prefers to create an account just to RSVP. This might deter participation. Having the option to RSVP as a non-user can be made available to encourage participation from people. Another feature I will implement is fixing the ical feed of all 'events' tagged notes by fixing the issues with Google Calendar usage. If the calendar can be integrated properly with the events, it could help users keep better track of the upcoming events.

Stats graphs appear in many places around the site, so improving these graphs will have a big impact on how people understand activity in Public Lab. The graphs haven't been improved since they were first created some years ago. Stats and graphs of all kinds are important for how the community can see itself, and for the non-profit to do evaluation with. New graphs could help improve the overall interface and user experience.

I will also be working on enhancements of the representation of tags across all types of wiki pages, research notes etc on the Public Lab website.

### Needs

I don't have any special requirements. Just need the guidance of a mentor and an internet connection.

### Setup

I have already forked and set up all the resources needed on my local machine. The link to the repo is:

### Experience

I have learned and have experience in Django, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Python, C, C++ through the various projects I've worked on and through college courses/assignments.

Other than publiclab, there are some open source projects I've contributed to like: [https://github.com/freedombox/Plinth](https://github.com/freedombox/Plinth) (Now archived)

Here are some of my PR's for PublicLab:

### Teamwork

I have worked on creating the Entrepreneurship-cell Website of our college with many other members. I am comfortable interacting with other team members and mingling with new people. I have also worked on numerous other college projects with fellow students. These experiences have given me the confidence to ask the silliest questions without any hesitation.

### Passion:

As a small part of the community, I feel we should all do our part in contributing to the betterment of the environment and society. It's difficult to find such opportunities frequently. Public Lab provides a great platform to help put my skills to good use.

### Audience:

Building on the existing model, I will try and keep my code as well documented and modular as possible making it simpler to make future updates based on different stats, new additions to the site etc.

### Commitment:

I understand that this project is equivalent to a full time summer job and will put in that level of effort by following the timeline I've proposed.
