Greetings wonderful people,

I have first version of gopro Hero 1 HD ( without screen version). I want to take out the IR filter from the camera to make it work in full spectrum. I disassembled the gopro (see picture below) and found that the lens is fixed. The only option is cutting the lens using dremel tool. But i am confused on where to cut?

Can anyone having previous experience help me on how to do so. The purpose of my work is to monitor crop health by attaching the modified gopro in the DJI Phantom 3 Professional.

I look forward to your suggestions.

Thanks a lot
