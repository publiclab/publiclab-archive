Dear All,
             Has anyone created a macro.txt file for batching the process of creating NDVI using Fiji/ImageJ. I have a macro file from Frank Aldious for batching the process but it is targetted for InfraBlue images, but i have Red Filter so this would not work for my case.

The macro is listed below. I want to modify it to suit my Modified Infrared Camera with Red Filter.

 adir = getDirectory("");
setBatchMode(true); run("Image Sequence...", "open=[adir] file=IMA sort use"); mydir = getDirectory(""); run("Split Channels"); run("infraBlueNDVI"); run("Calibration Bar...", "location=[Upper Right] fill=None label=Black number=5 decimal=0 font=12 zoom=2 overlay"); run("Image Sequence... ", "format=JPEG save=[mydir]")

run("Close All");

setBatchMode(false);
