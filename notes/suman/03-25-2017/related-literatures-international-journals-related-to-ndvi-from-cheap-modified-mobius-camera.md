Dear All, 
              I am a graduate student doing a research on cheap modified infrared camera for plant health monitoring (NDVI) attached to UAV. I have a mobius actioncam modified infrared with standard 87 mm A lens. 

I was curious to know whether anyone has published related international journal from public labs on Modified mobius actioncam. If yes, please share me the link to the journal paper.

Looking forward to hear from you.

Thank you

Best Regards,

Suman
