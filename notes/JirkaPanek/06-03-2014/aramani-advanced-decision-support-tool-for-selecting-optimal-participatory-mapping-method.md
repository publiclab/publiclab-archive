Dear fellow researchers, scientists, friends.

I have created, based on more than 150 survey answers, tool for advanced decision-making about selecting optimal participatory mapping method. This ([http://ondrejruzicka.cz/jp_disertace/en](http://ondrejruzicka.cz/jp_disertace/en)) is the first beta version of the tool and it would be VERY helpful if you, people who are active in participatory research, can have a look at it, try it and tell me, what should be done better :-)

The whole survey and tool/research are parts of my PhD at the Department of Development Studies ([http://www.development.upol.cz/english/people/jiri-panek/](http://www.development.upol.cz/english/people/jiri-panek/))

Thank you and have a nice day
