On Sunday December 18, 2011, three eager workshop attendees and one workshop sansei (Jeffrey Warren) created 3 Thermal Flashlights based on the circuit design ["Circuit diagram for simple thermal flashlight"](http://publiclaboratory.com/notes/warren/12-12-2011/circuit-diagram-simple-thermal-flashlight), designed by the sensei himself.    

After about two hours of fiddling with capacitors, resistors, bread boards, LEDs, Arduinos, batteries, and various wires, we had three new prototypes up and running. To protect our Thermal Flashlights and help prevent the LED from being exposed directly to the camera (causes streaks of light when using a program like Glow Doodle to capture exposures), we carved out holes in our VHS cassette cases and placed our Thermal Flashlights inside of the casing.

After pointing our Thermal Flashlight at a few objects to confirm that the units were working, we decided to modify the default temperature range so we could take them outside in the 25 Â°F weather. I was impressed at how well the thermal flashlights worked outside in the cold.  While the photo gives you a general idea of the temperatures the thermal flashlight was showing us, I don't think the photo really does the thermal flashlight the justice it deserves.
