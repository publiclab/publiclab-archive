(This is cross posted from my blog, with a little delay.  We have since applied for the grant mentioned and I have become involved in helping the Farm Hack community figure out what they want to do for a documentation site.  A questionnaire I'm building to help with that -> http://substance.io/rjstatic/we-believe-in-sharing/2)

<p>Last weekend I had a great time at FarmHack NH in Lee, VT talking about smart farm technology and my experience with Wireless Sensor Networks.  The first day was a tour of a local farm, dinner, and some late night bonfire discussions which I was not able to attend.  The second day we met up early at the Grange Hall (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Grange_of_the_Order_of_Patrons_of_Husbandry">interesting history behind these buildings</a>) in Lee, NH and split off into working groups.  I joined the "Smart Farm" group which consisted of about 8 people discussing various creative ways that technologies like Arduino (http://www.arduino.cc) have been used to solve problems on farms.  There was a lot of energy directed towards finding a project to work on together so we settled on tackling alerts for greenhouses.  We have a grant application due on December 1 and we're still discussing exactly what kind of set up we're going to go for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After the working groups, we made presentations on our discussions and ended up spending a lot of time talking about how to continue the conversations online.  I think there are a lot of parallels between the NYFC and the PLOTS community (http://publiclaboratory.org) and there is room to learn from each other and collaborate.  Right now the community consists of a blog (http://www.youngfarmers.org), a new forum (http://www.youngfarmers.org/forum), and soon a wiki to record all of the solutions they discuss on the forum.  I've been wondering if an Instructables-like feature (http://www.instructables.com) for their site might make more sense than a Wiki.  Perhaps even an instructables-like feature combined with wiki functionality.  This would add structure and consistency of an instruction set while maintaining the anyone-can-edit mentality of a wiki.  The functionality I'm thinking of seems similar to that of Drupal "books", so of course, the wheels in my head are spinning :).</p>
