# Using PurpleAir Sensor to monitor neighbour's second hand smoke

My two adult neighbours smoke outside their property daily (on and off between 5am - 9pm) and within 3 to 6 metres (10 to 20 feet) of my balcony door/windows.

I've asked them politely to smoke at the front of their property but they refuse.

As a result I often had the doors and windows on the main side of my home shut (for hours at a time) do avoid the second hand smoke.

I want to build a case against them to take to the council that would detail the times (and perhaps measurements) of their regular smoking between 5am - 9pm - 7 days a week.

Can anybody provide feedback whether or not a PurpleAir Sensor (via PM 2.5) would be suitable to detect second hand smoke (outside) within 3 to 6 metres (10 to 20 feet) of the sensor (please mention if you think 6 metres might NOT be detected)

FYI - at both 3 to 6 metres I can smell the smoke but whether or not the sensor would show a spike in the PM 2.5 readings is the unknown.

Thanks in advance!
