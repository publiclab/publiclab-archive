## Project description:

New User Interface (UI) design implementation of the Public Lab website.

### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

Implementation of UI will be done using Bootstrap 4
UI library and the Style Guide provided by Public Lab.

### Problem

A well designed user interface is simple to use and
improves user involvement of any system. Some pages in the [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org)
website need a better user interface than it currently has to make it easily
understandable to the user. For example, some issues to be improved on are:

[](https://publiclab.org/tag/mapknitter)

- Colours of elements are not consistent across pages
- Some pages are cluttered and need to be spaced out
- Tags/Topics page should show cards instead of table rows  
- Navigating the pages should be easy

### Timeline/milestones

Below is my project timeline. I have a day each week to review Pull Request (PR) and

make some FTO issues so as to involve new contributors to my project. At the end of each milestone, I plan to test the implementation using [lookback.io](http://lookback.io)

### Experience

I
am a graduate of Computer Science with Masters degree in Information Systems Management.
Most knowledge I had of Information Technology were theoretical, my practical
journey into software development started 10 months ago. I have worked with
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have built a Pixel Art Maker, which uses JavaScript Code to let a user create a grid of squares representing their design and apply colours to those squares to create a digital masterpiece [https://github.com/AnthoniaOkafor/AnthoniaOkafor.github.io](https://github.com/AnthoniaOkafor/AnthoniaOkafor.github.io).\__My contribution to Public Lab is my first involvement
with Open Source. I am also one of the assistant organisers of Google
Developer Group (GDG) Ojo-Festac, Nigeria_.

### Teamwork

_Most of my coursework and University projects were performed in teams. I am a team player and I exhibit right attitude when in a team. As an assistant organiser of GDG Ojo-Festac, Nigeria, I work effectively in a team to plan and organise events._

---------

### Passion

I am
excited to be part of Public Lab, I love technology and display enthusiasm wherever I find myself. Open Science holds strong interest to me
because of the belief that\*\*\*\*\_"_science
must be done in an open, and reproducible fashion where all components of
research"\_\_such as hardware, software tools and methods, are
open._

### Audience

_Since a good User Interface improves user participation, my work would be beneficial to all users of [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org), especially new users._
