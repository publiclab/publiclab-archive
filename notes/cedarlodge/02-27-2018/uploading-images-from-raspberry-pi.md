I'm currently building a lego spectrometer with a pi zero W. Currently the images are being saved to a removable USB drive which I then plug into my laptop and upload to spectral workbench from there. The spectrometer itself is being controlled by a python script which I initiate over SSH.

  
Is there a way to upload to images direct to spectral workbench? Maybe through an API?
