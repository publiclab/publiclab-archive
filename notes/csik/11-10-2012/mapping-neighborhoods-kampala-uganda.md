Maria del Carmen Lamadrid, Heather Grates, and Chris Csikszentmihalyi mapped the 
•Women's Craft Market in Nsambya, Kampala, Central Region, Uganda, which is slated to be cleared for development
•TLC Youth Center in Kamwokya, Kawempe, Kampala, Central Region, Uganda.  https://mapknitter.org/maps/tlc-youth-center



Mostly overcast, rain immediately before and after the sessions.  Wind was variable, but Kampala is always fairly calm even during the rainy season.  We had local connections in both places, in one case the LC1 (something like an alderman) and the other the manager of the youth center.  

The Craft Market was fairly easy, what was more interesting was the Youth Center, because of... the Youth.  When we started mapping we had a half dozen children around, but by the end of the session over 50 kids were mobbing us, trying to grab the string, chanting "bring it down" because they wanted to touch the balloon.  It was touch and go a few times, and one toddler got a bloody nose when her more boisterous mates knocked her down.  Still, fun was had by all, and all the kids got to fly the kite, first informally and then when a line formed over the small bridge toward the left of the sports field.

Equipment:
-Stewart's old balloon (priceless)
-Cannon hacker modified camera on intervalometer
-String, swivel, etc from the standard PLOTS kit
