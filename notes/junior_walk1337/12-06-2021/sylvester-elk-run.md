Here's a short video of a town near me and the abandoned coal processing plant next to it. The Elk Run plant has been shuttered for a few years now, however what still remains is a massive, unlined coal slurry dam only a short distance from people's homes. It's one of many similar dams dotting our region, and is a concern for anyone who lives nearby. This also happens to be the same facility where I worked in 2008\.
