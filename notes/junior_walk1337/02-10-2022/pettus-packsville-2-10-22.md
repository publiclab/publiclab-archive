Here is an underground mining operation and processing plant located in Pettus, and Packsville/Marfork WV. Up until recent years the town of Pettus was a small community of homes, much like the homes in the town of Eunice that you can see only a few hundred yards from the mining operations that now exist where their neighbors used to live.
