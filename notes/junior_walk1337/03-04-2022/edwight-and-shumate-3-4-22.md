Here we have the Edwight surface mine, the Shumate coal slurry impoundment, and the Goals processing plant. All of which have been inactive in recent years. Next to it you will notice the old Marsh Fork elementary school, which was shut down in 2012 after years of pressure from activists to relocate the school to somewhere that wasn't directly under a coal slurry impoundment.
