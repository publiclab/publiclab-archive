Goal: Non invasive way Blood component analysis using Finger Tip video image by smart phone

I am planing to use spectrometer and will try to analyze the spectrum 

How to collect the video to get best data for analysis

I am using my mobile camera at this moment to record video image and analyze the data. But this result is not good.
