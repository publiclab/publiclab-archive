## Project description

Infragram assists customized cameras users with to upload photographs for analysis and conversion using techniques like NDVI (used in satellite imaging analysis). In the project, I added a modal to the Infragram page, changed the layout of the page and moved the Q&A section to the help button.

### 

### Problem

- There is a confusion on how to use the app and navigate it, so a modal can be added to welcome the user and to inform them how to navigate the page

- The logo and name of the can be restructured and the purpose of the app can be stated with like two or three lines. To also remind users of the purpose of the app.
- The upload video section needs not to be enlarged while being clicked on so as not to overwhelm the user and there has been difficult on how to exit the big screen. A drag and drop section can be added to the upload video section
- The layout of the Infragram heading could be more structured in way that when the screen is responsive it can be easy to align it or move it to another section
- The footer can also be redesigned and more structured

- The Q&A section distracts the user from the purpose of app, so the Q&A needs to be moved to a different page entirely and re-designed so it can be more appealing.

### My Solution

My solution helps the user to easily understand how the app functions and makes them concentrate on the purpose of the app.

### Needs

I would need to do more research on how to be a valuable contributor to open source projects and also on the programming language being used in the course. I would also would upgrade my Laptop's capacity so it can carry out swift operations. I would also need a mentor to guide me throughout my journey, to know I am on the right track.

###   

### Experience

I began learning to code in December. It's been a difficult experience. With the aid of various lessons from FreeCodeCamp and W3schools, I began learning HTML and CSS. I began learning JavaScript earlier this year with the aid of various videos on '[Javascript.info](http://Javascript.info),' YouTube, and Udemy courses. With a team of software developers, product designers, and project managers, I worked on a React project. The project taught me about agile methodologies, particularly scrum. I also used Trello boards to keep track of my stand-ups and sprints. Link to the repo: [https://github.com/Mfonn/Colab](https://github.com/Mfonn/Colab).
Following the project, I enrolled in a one-month Girls in Tech bootcamp, where I learned how to use Bootstrap. Because I was able to meet and collaborate with prospective software engineers in a Hackathon Competition in Lagos, Nigeria, it was a really interesting and inspirational experience. Following the training, I wanted to work at a public lab and contribute to open source while also learning new skills. I'm presently learning Vue.js and used it to create my first Todo List App. It's available at ([https://ifetakuro.github.io/todo-list-vue3/](https://ifetakuro.github.io/todo-list-vue3/)). I'm eager to learn new things, give back to the community, and further my profession. My GitHub page: [https://github.com/Ifetakuro](https://github.com/Ifetakuro)

### Teamwork

I collaborated alongside a software developer, a product designer, and a project manager on this project. It was a closed-source undertaking. I felt driven because I knew I was tackling a real-world problem, and my teammates were counting on me to complete my portion of the assignment. I also regarded any bugs I encountered while coding as a learning opportunity.

---------

### Passion

As a software engineer, I am enthusiastic about contributing to open source projects. I discovered that the public lab provides a safe environment in which I may pursue a career as a software developer without fear of prejudice because of my background.

### Audience

I want my work to assist members of the public who are having trouble navigating the website and understanding the app's purpose.

### Commitment

I'd plan my day as if I were working from home. I would organize my daily duties for work every day, for example, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and then set aside time to continue studying and conducting research so that I could develop high-quality codes.
