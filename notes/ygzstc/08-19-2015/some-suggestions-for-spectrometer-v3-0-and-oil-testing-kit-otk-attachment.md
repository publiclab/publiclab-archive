_**Last Updated on September 2nd, 2015**_

I just wanted to share some ideas and suggestions for improving the stability of the spectrometer v3.0 and oil testing kit attachment. I'll try to keep updating/modifying this list of items time to time.


**1- DVD holder attached to wooden block**

If you need/want to re-place the current DVD holder, velcro is too strong and may damage the holder’s bottom section. So, you can attach the DVD holder to the wooden block instead. An idea of this attachment is in Figure 1. Also this may help to achieve inter-device compatibility.

**2 - 	Separate top for spectrometer**

Folding edges of top of the spec tends to be torn easily (especially the folding edge on the camera side) so using tape might be a good idea. In addition, separate top might be a simple idea to modify without disturbing the optical setup at the bottom part. (For the sketch see Figure 2.)

**3- Stabilizing the USB cable**

You can use tape to stabilize the USB cable of the webcam to the wooden block to prevent disturbing the camera position (Figure 3)

**4- Increasing the stability of the OTK attachment**

Some folded parts of OTK can be fixed using double-sided tape (or with few drops of glue) to make it more sturdy (Figure 4)

[![Picture1.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/208/medium/Picture1.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/208/original/Picture1.jpg)

**5- Connection between OTK and spectrometer**

Stable connection between OTK attachment and spectrometer is necessary. Tape/velcro on the bottom and some attachment like in Figure 5 on top may be useful. This also helps reducing unwanted ambient light to leak inside.

_Figure 5_


**6- External Power Supply for Laser**

An alternative way to set up the laser is to use few additional cables an external battery holder (Figure 6). Advantages of this kind of setup are: (i) you can change the batteries and operate the laser during measurements without touching/disturbing the OTK attachment; (ii) you can even use an ac/dc adapter (3V dc output) to eliminate low battery charge (i.e. low laser intensity); (iii) you can even power the laser (or any other light source you want to test) using USB port of your laptop/PC. But you have to keep in mind that USB provides 5V output NOT 3V; (iv) you can have a smaller OTK attachment.

**7- Alignment between Spectrometer Slit and Cuvette Holder of the OTK**

In my case, alignment between the slit and OTK was off. So, I used double-sided tape to adjust the height of the spectrometer (Figure 7). This also helps to have a more stable connection between the spectrometer and OTK attachment.

**8- Modifying OTK for Absorbance Spectroscopy Applications**
 
Having another opening on the back side of the OTK attachment (see Figure 8) allows us to use this attachment for absorbance spectroscopy applications as well. (Details like size, shape etc. needs to be carefully calculated though!)
