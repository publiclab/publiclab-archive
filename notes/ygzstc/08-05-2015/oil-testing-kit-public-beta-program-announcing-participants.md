We've had a huge response for our call for help in the [Oil Testing Kit Beta Program from a couple weeks ago](/notes/ygzstc/07-14-2015/oil-testing-kit-beta-program), and today we're ready to announce our selection. These 20 people have agreed to participate in the first public beta of the OIl Testing Kit by posting documentation of their tests as well as their raw data to troubleshoot the procedure and setup. 

Some applicants posted great reasons why they're interested in the kit. Just a few excerpts:
    
* "...over recent years we have suffered from oil pollution on our beaches after ship wrecks and also oil spills at a oil refinery on the river Loire who's estuarie is near our beaches. We sometimes find black residue on rocks and I would like to be able to test these and also water samples around our area."
* "We have been looking for just such a way of consistently testing samples from locations in and around our bay... both where we suspect legacy petrol-based waste dumps and spills, and to examine new spills."
* "Vancouver recently had an oil spill happen right in the city waters, and months later there is still black crusty stuff on the beach which no one seems concerned about. "

We have a lot to do before we can get to testing some of these scenarios, but the Beta Program is intended to refine and improve our test so that we can do rigorous and credible testing soon!

So without further ado, by username, we'd like to welcome:

* [cquijano84](/profile/cquijano84)

We'll be announcing a quick meetup session in a week or so where we'll outline some of the specific responsibilities participants will have, and be available to answer more questions. 

If you weren't selected this time, **don't worry** - we anticipate a broader release pretty soon, so you won't have to wait long to get your hands on a kit. We are **very** eager to get you all kits and to grow this important effort. 

Congratulations to everyone!
