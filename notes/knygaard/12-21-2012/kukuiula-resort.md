The Kukuiula Club  is a luxury community in Koloa, Kauai. Their relatively new development was looking for a map more accurate than recent Google data.  By sending them a weather balloon and kit, they took aerial photos from which we created our mapknitter map – a one of a kind map of their property.
Because the site is so large, we had over 1000 photographs to work with. Using an automated lens correction tool on Adobe Photoshop, I converted fisheye photos to rectilinear. Once I had the corrected photos, I began selecting areas on Map Knitter to work on. I’ve never used Map Knitter before so I watched the tutorial which explained everything I needed to know about all the tools and how to use them.
Because our photographs were taken from a truck and boat driving around the property, they sort of create a snaking path across the property. This made it fairly easy to move from one area of the map to the next. The easiest sections were roads and fields. These large areas were less detailed so I didn’t have to spend much time doing extra cropping or using Map Knitter’s distortion tool. 
The most challenging portions of the map were the areas of high detail, such as the groups of buildings near the parking lot and the lake. Because of the perpendicular structure of the buildings, it was hard to find photographs, even after the lens correction, which accurately portrayed the area. Often, I would have to crop photographs and cluster many together in these areas. Over all, Map Knitter was easy to use and had awesome results for our map.
