###What I want to do
The destop spectrometer kit and the oil testing kit was set up as below. The slit was using the standard slit provided in the kit

###My attempt and results
The laser, the camera is working properly and the substance can produce certain color of fluroscene.
However,No spectro data has been produced by this kit. There are several issue for this kit. Firstly there's a alignment problem between the laser and the currette. Therefore, the fluorescence light due to the blue laser was unable to produce. It is recommended that embedding the currette directly to the slit.
Secondly, 90 degree fluorescence side light of the organic matter is too weak. It is recommended that forward light(Laser,detector and currette should form a straight line) should be detected instead of side light.
Thirdly, spectrum was not produced even the light has been passed through to the camera(don't mention the camera, even the spectrum using naked eye cannot be seen). diffraction grating angle needed to be adjusted.
###Questions and next steps
Conclusion: This kit cannot produce a significant result and need to be modified
Update on 10/10/2015
Setting modified:

Technical problem:Camera cannot be anchored properly. Therefore, the diffraction grating is not completely on the view of the camera(which blocked some of the image)
No spectrum has been produced at this stage even though I am directly spot on Desk Lamp!
