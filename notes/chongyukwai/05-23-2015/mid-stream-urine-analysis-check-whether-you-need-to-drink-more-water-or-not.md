Background: This is an experiential application of using spectro as a measurement of the concentration of the urine. So people are unaware that they drink insufficient water. This experiment helps us to generate information and provide evidence whether they have drink sufficient H2O and provide advice to them.

Method
The method has been published in this research note under the incandescent light.
http://publiclab.org/notes/chongyukwai/05-23-2015/heat-con-spectro-photometer
After taking the spectro image of all three in 0 degree, the image is analysed using spectrobench and auto detect the highest peak 
Result and discussion:
Data was published in this page.
https://spectralworkbench.org/sets/show/2219
It showed that in the H2O, all the light can pass through.
However, even when there was slightly color difference in the urine. The spectro still can detect and give a unbalanced index compare to different wave length.

Left is light urine and the right is normal tape water

Compare with light urine and H2O, all light can be transmitted in H2O but in light urine red and purple light were being absorbed which can be deviated between the two. In high concentrated urine, a significant high peak value was found in the yellow spectrum.
Discussion: Further research is needed in order to more quantitative identify the concentration of urine and whether it has reached certain level (pathogenic level).
