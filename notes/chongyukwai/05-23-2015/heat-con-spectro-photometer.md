Instruction of the design
[![Tool_(1).png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/987/medium/Tool_%281%29.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/987/original/Tool_%281%29.png)


Procedure
Preparation: 
(1)Cut a part of DVD/ CD(R)
(2)Stick with the plastic tape and tease it off to remove metallic shield and let out the transparent plastic shield
 Font
Step (1) :prepare a dark box with the size listed above.
Step (2) : At the font, cut the slit with 1mm*1cm 
Step (3) : Use the tissue/cotton to form a holder
Back
Step (1) :Place the plastic shield onto the back and place the tape to the right half to stick to the botton and the botton half to stick to the right side/botton with an angel from 10-30 degree.
Step (2) :Place a few cotton/tissue paper/whatever thing stick to the down right hand corner and secure with a tape until you think that it can form an angel from 10-30 degree unit you think you can place another plastic shield to a flat surface
Step (3) Place another plastic shield and stick with tape with half of the right and the lower half.
Place the PCR tube at the holder and place it next to the light and turn it on. It will form a light at the center.
Precaution: It can only be used for less than one min and you have to turn it off to cool down for a few min or it will break if it takes too long

The tube is being heat at the same time.
It will form a light  spectrum  if you look deep down.
Advantage:
No overexposure at this stage
The result of the spectrum does not curve up
The tube is being heat at the same time in certain condition and can do spectro measurement at the same time.
Limitation: At this stage only can be used for visible light
only high intensity of light and form the light spectrum at the botton.
