###What I want to do or know:  
Can I generate a reflectance curve like that shown for lawn grass at the start of research note http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/11-01-2013/why-a-red-filter-should-work-well-for-ndvi by simply pointing the Public Lab desktop spectrometer at a patch of grass on a sunny day? Would it be that simple, or would I need some optics to bring enough light into the desktop spectrometer for that to work?  Or would it not work even then?
###Background story:  
Trying to find a way to analyze and track grass properties, initially using the method described in http://publiclab.org/notes/WhiteRabbit/07-25-2014/can-infragrams-provide-useful-measurements-of-thirsty-my-lawn-is, but now I'm wondering whether the Public Labs Desktop Spectrometer might be a shorter and possibly better path toward extracting data about a lawn's condition.
