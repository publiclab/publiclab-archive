# CHAQ: Visualizing Air Quality - Class 5 - March 8th

In class on March 8th, the MIT team worked with the Cypress Hills 7th & 8th graders to try to develop ways to communicate Air Quality data visually. The students had two data sets to work with: a small amount of air quality egg data (2 weeks, 5 eggs, measuring Temperature, Humidity, and VOCs) and the results of surveys they conducted. The students had gone through the process of creating a survey about certain Air Quality triggers and measures as well as how their community shares information. As part of their homework during the previous two weeks, the students had administered the survey to their friends and family. The raw measurement data and the culled survey data created a sense of context for the science, as the students really tried to think about how they could communicate these abstract measurements to their community.

After a quick overview of how visualization works [include link to presentation] and how we can work use different data attributes visually, we broke into groups to brainstorm ways of visualizing the different data sets either alone or together. Each student group worked with one of the MIT or Public Laboratory team, to analyze the data of their choice and then think about ways to convey that to others. 

One group of students was really interested in the the distribution of survey participants who had asthma. They designed a visualization that used size and color to represent how many people had responded to the question: “Does anyone in your family have asthma?” They used green to represent all those people who responded that no one in their family had asthma. They chose red to represent all those people who responded that more than three people in their family had asthma.

Other groups dug into information about the community, working with word clouds and bubble diagrams to show where people in the community come from originally. The important aspect here is seeing and understanding yourself in the data. All of the students were excited to see how their responses related to those of their classmates, neighbors and friends. This allowed them to feel connected to the data and then think about how to tie in the information from the Air Quality Eggs.

Others thought about ways to incorporate the information into a map showing readings from the AQEggs and information from their research about possible causes. The group decided that the Air Quality measurements should be grouped into “good,” “ok,” and “bad” using a color scale from green to yellow to purple. They also included things like factories, cars, and parks to indicate both positive and negative environmental factors that affect the air quality.

All in all we had fun and brainstormed lots of ideas! Check out some of the other Research Notes tagged: <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/CHAQ">CHAQ</a> to see the other sketches!
