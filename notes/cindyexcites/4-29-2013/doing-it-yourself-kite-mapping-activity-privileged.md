Perhaps doing citizen science, as in taking the initiative to start a scientific project by yourself, requires a lot more than we think and makes us realise how much we take for granted.

DIY Delta Kite - a Public Laboratory prototype
I went out this past weekend to try some kite-mapping in a park in North London. It is quite easy to get excited about it as you unfold the large white and red <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/mathew/7-19-2012/easy-cut-delta-kite-plans">delta-kite</a> – instant joy as you imagine yourself running across a field with the kite riding high up in the sky. I began the little project by looking at the <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/kite-mapping">Public Laboratory</a> instruction sheet that came with my <a href="http://store.publiclaboratory.org/products/balloon-mapping-kit">balloon/kite-mapping kit</a>. I had the <strong>time</strong><strong></strong> to spare and so together with my partner we decided to make a fancier camera rig that would allow the camera to hang freely with great stability and for this we looked at a <a href="http://publiclab.org/notes/TedF/08-18-2013/constructing-a-2-90g-wooden-metal-picavet">DIY Picavet rig</a> <strong>online</strong> to prototype our model. We fetched a little piece of plywood that was lying around and from our <strong>handy toolbox</strong> we got our saw, looped screws and nails. We made our DIY rig, packed our bag with all our necessaries and off we went to the park.

It was a long and frustrating first attempt with most of the time spent on trying to get the kite up there. "There's just no wind - should we try again?" "Can't come back tomorrow - I've got to work". But in the end, the photos were not too bad! See slideshow below. Mapping using kites or balloons filled with helium is an incredible experience. However, balloon-mapping here in London is not as viable as kite-mapping because helium is difficult to get a hold of and its high price per tank reflects its rarity. The delta kite I used is a <strong>£5 prototype</strong> I helped build last November at the annual <a href="http://uclexcites.wordpress.com/2012/11/10/strengthening-community-plots-barn-raising-2012/">Public Laboratory Barnraising</a> event. The workshop itself took 3.5 hours. Preparing the equipment and flying the kite took 6 hours. Analysing the photographs and stitching them to overlay them on Google maps will take another 5-6 hours.

Some argue that citizen-supported scientific initiatives are for the privileged few (Brossard and Shanahan, 2003; Jenkins, 1999; De Vos and Reiding, 1999); that in order to be able to do activities such as these you have to have: the <strong>time</strong> to spare, quick <strong>access to information</strong>, the means to get the tools needed, and the <strong>self-confidence</strong> characteristic of those who either have nothing to lose by doing this and failing at it or are an established middle class or higher living in a developing country.

A surge in citizen science in the last decade, especially, in citizen cyberscience (facilitated by the Internet, the Web and widespread of ICTs) can be linked to a trend in higher attainment in education, reduction in working hours coupled with an increased in leisure activities, etc. Indeed, this points to a bias in the socio-economic make-up of citizen science (Haklay, 2013). However, it is also important to highlight that the overall effect of these trends is taken for granted. Humanity is in fact living a better life now compared to the last century, with an exponential rise in recent decades (Veenhoven, 2010). In fact, although a reliance on well-educated individuals in citizen cyberscience initiatives might be taken for granted by project designers, the proliferation of DIY fora and other websites (e.g. instructables.com, publiclaboratory.com, kickstarter.com, to name a few) betrays a strong initiative by <strong>ordinary citizens from all walks of life</strong>. And just like with kite and balloon mapping, DIY approaches to research are increasingly being used in <a href="http://uclexcites.wordpress.com/2012/07/05/anti-poaching-application/">many</a>, <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/places">many corners of the world</a>, pushing for a democratisation of science and engineering.
