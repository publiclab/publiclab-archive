Hello All! I finally managed to make myself an infrared camera using the same canon model as in the tutorial. However, I got two different results with two different films: 1) a piece of film extracted from an new film roll and exposed to direct light and 2) an end piece of developed film as shown in the <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/near-infrared-camera">video tutorial</a> these are my corresponding results:

1) Picture taken with filter made from film pulled out from new roll and exposed to light.


2) Picture taken with filter made from end of exposed film as shown as the end of the <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/near-infrared-camera">video tutorial</a>.

Which one is the correct one? I know that the picture taken with the pulled out film is blurry but it seems to show more of the typical 'infrared' imagery. Does it have to do with the chemical treatment given to the film? Also, does it matter which way the DIY filter goes into the camera - shiny side towards the lens or away from the lens? Thanks!
