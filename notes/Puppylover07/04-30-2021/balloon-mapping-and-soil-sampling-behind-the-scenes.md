Yesterday me and some other students had a guest speaker at our school. Her name was pearl (which in my opinion was a very pretty name). While she was hear we did a lot of fun but educating activities. I participated in two of these activities which were soil sampling and balloon mapping. During these activities I learned a little about helium, how to work with others, and much more. One of the things I remembered talking about was how we needed gloves in order to hold the string which was connected to the balloon because apparently it would get hot but I can't really remember why.
