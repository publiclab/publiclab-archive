I am trying to figure out how we can give cyclists across DC temperature sensors that would capture temperature data at a minimum of every 5 seconds (or even faster, if possible) as they travel through the city. I am looking for something that could plug directly into a phone, so the data could easily be shared, or something that could be downloaded via USB. Data would not need to be immediately transmitted in real-time. 

Any suggestions on the best ready-to-use devices? Priorities right now are: sensitive to temperature changes, able to take readings every 5 seconds (or less), fairly lightweight, and ability to store 2000 data points, minimum, before downloading. Battery drain and price, at this point, basically not an issue.

In the medium-term, we're looking for folks in DC interested in trying to disseminate more of these sensors and organize some DIY classes to make what we'd need to capture that type of thermal information more broadly across the city.

The background and context: I'm part of a research team at the University of the District of Columbia and am working on a multidisciplinary project looking at urban heat islands in the district, and particularly to see if farms and parks have a similar effect to forested areas on urban heat island, or whether the shading and evapotranspiration effects of trees make forested-cooling much more significant. Happy for collaborators interested in this question or in creating more mobile temperature sensors that can record or track data over long(ish) periods of time.
