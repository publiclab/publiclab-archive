</br>
During a three month period, the fellow will work on creating ten case studies that demonstrate a breadth of instances where using the [Public Lab Oil Testing Kit](http://publiclab.org/wiki/oil-testing-kit) would be applicable. Examples of case studies could include developing narrative around oil train travel in the continental U.S. and the potential for train spills or providing evidence to companies that unidentified material is oil.

The development of these case studies will be used to provide context for community groups and individuals interested in oil identification. After the case studies are developed, the Fellow will work with the Data Ambassador to create a series of advocacy packets based on case specific needs.
