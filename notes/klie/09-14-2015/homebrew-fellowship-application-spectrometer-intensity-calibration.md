#####**Application due:** September 25, 2015
#####**Dates of Fellowship:** mid-October 2015 to mid-January 2016
#####**Location:** Remote, with preference to Raleigh-Durham
#####**Fellowship stipend:** $3,000 USD

This research fellowship will focus on the optimization of the [Public Lab Spectrometer](http://publiclab.org/wiki/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0) to quantify the intensity of visible light at specific wavelengths to produce light intensity calibration curves for a range of sample concentrations.  It is expected that the fellow will conduct experiments involving chemistry and possible hardware modification (e.g. exposure optimization). The fellow will produce a system for achieving absolute intensity calibration with a spectrometer built from a standard webcam, which will include a written protocol and may include a prototype device and online calibration integration.

<br>
The fellow should have a background in physics or chemistry, with spectroscopy experience preferred.  The fellow should have experience conducting independent laboratory-based studies. The fellow will work closely with the staff Data Ambassador and the Director of Production throughout the fellowship tenure, and will have support particularly in study design, material sourcing, and troubleshooting. 
<br>

Successful completion of this fellowship will produce: 

1.  Wiki documentation and research notes on calibration protocols for accurate intensity detection.

2.  A comprehensive portfolio of spectra from experimental calibration annotated and uploaded to [Spectral Workbench 2.0](http://www.spectralworkbench.org/). 

3.  Integration of procedural wiki pages with [Spectral Workbench 2.0](http://www.spectralworkbench.org/) (e.g. through pop-ups or wizards).
