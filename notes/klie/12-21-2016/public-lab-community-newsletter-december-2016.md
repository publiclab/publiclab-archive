####**How It Works: Newsletter Relaunch**
We've relaunched the newsletter and will be sending it out monthly, in addition to sharing it on publiclab.org in the format below! If you previously received them through our main mailing list, please note that you must **[subscribe here if you want to continue receiving them in the future](https://confirmsubscription.com/h/d/280EC1B40351B40B)**. 
If you aren't sure whether or not you've already signed up, please feel free to do so again - we'll delete the duplicates. 
 
_Note: All newsletters also include a link to unsubscribe at any time._
