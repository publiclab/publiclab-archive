The Public Mapping Mission is an online course focusing on the importance of open science and public policy.  The course will be structured in two parts.  First, an online session with discussions about open science and public policy will be held with Jeffrey Warren, Francois Grey and Beth Novek.  The second part of the course will be an a combination offline-online balloon mapping event.  Participants of the initial session will be encouraged to participate in an online balloon mapping workshop followed by an offline 'map you community event'.  This will allow participants the opportunity to form groups and go out to map an area of their community they feel is important.  The groups will then come back online to share and discuss the results of the day.


** Initial discussion** - November 22nd, 3:30-4:30pm
