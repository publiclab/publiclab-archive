Following [this amazing tutorial](http://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/07-14-2014/how-to-download-and-use-landsat-images), I dove in and started looking at satellite imagery over New York City.  Using the techniques discussed in the tutorial, I began processing the image with QGIS and created the above image.  The image provides a very interesting view of the New York bay and one can visually see color differences in the water(which I'm assuming are temperature differences - I really have very little understanding of satellite imagery processing!).  

What is most interesting in this image is the large red spot located just off Breezy Point.  Can anyone help me to understand what would cause the differences in temperature there?  

Thanks so much for the tutorial and I would love to keep learning more about this technology and the various ways to use it.
