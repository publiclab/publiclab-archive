Hello fellow mappers!
I run a website called [flightriot.com](flightriot.com), which is devoted to advocating purpose driven uses of geospatial technology in personal Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), with a particular focus on mapping and 3D modeling applications. A major current goal is to complete an aerial imagery post processing open workflow (free for research, education, and personal use) and publish the results for others to use. 

The reason I think this information is so relevant to folks at Public Lab is that the methodologies and resulting data sets are directly applicable to balloon and kite mapping applications. 

So, the purpose of this research note is simply to share the progress I've made with Public Lab with the intent of benefiting those performing kite and balloon mapping. Also, anyone that is new to personal UAVs for mapping will benefit as well.

Currently, there are two available tutorials that you can find on youtube and flightriot.com here:

I hope you enjoy!!! :)

I have also been working on testing Infrablue filters for single camera NDVI in support of the work at PL and I will be posting a research note on some of the challenges I've experienced with a Canon SX230. There seems to be additional challenges with CMOS sensor cameras for this application and I'm hoping that together we can solve some of the remaining issues.
