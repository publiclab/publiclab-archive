I tried using the infragram with a Pi NoIR camera with a blue filter, but when processing the image the result was an almost entirely blue image, as you can see below.

  
(I'm putting a link to view the image because I'm having trouble uploading)

This is the original picture

I would like to know why this is and how can I generate a good NDVI image.  

  
Thank you for attention.
