Hello,

  
I was just wondering in you examples you use spectral workbench with the raspberry pi zero.

when i want to run it, it run so slow that i cant do anything. i also tried it with the pi 3 a bit more responsive but still not usable and in both cases it is a clean installation with all updates.

  
I was wondering is there a special version of the page that will work?
