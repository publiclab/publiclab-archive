About me  

_**Name**: Getty Orawo_

**Affiliation** (Podii Software academy and Consultancy)

**Location:** (Kisumu, Kenya)

  
## Project description

Abstract/summary (<20 words):

UI design enhancement of [publiclab.org](http://publiclab.org)

### Problem

_[Publiclab.org](http://Publiclab.org) being a functional and well informative site needs a few touches on it's UI displays to bring out the best in it's presentation to first timers visiting the site and even day-to-day users. There are various pages that need UI attention taking that they aren't as presentable as they could ultimately be._

### Timeline/milestones

Having No solid professional background in design or graphics. I will maximize my time on the implementation using the many good looking ready-made wire frames from the UI designers. This will involve breaking down the milestones into smaller manageable chunks so as to cover much ground with maximum understanding of the concepts used.

**Milestone 1) Profile Page**

The profile page currently looks like this fro a new user:

![image description](/i/30737.png "Screenshot_from_2019-03-26_10-10-42.png")

The wire frame we could use for the design revamp is:

![image description](/i/30740.png "PublicLab_mockups.png")

**Timeline (Profile Page)**

For the highlighted period below; The following milestones can be accomplished on this page:

| Time Allocation |  | Tasks |
|-----------------|--|-------|
| May 20th        |  | Brainstorm on techniques and approaches to use during the week and fully setup to kick off |
| May 21st - May 23rd |  | Replace Activity Bar with subheads as a list, each adjacent to the count of how often it has been worked on |
| May 24rd - May 26th |  | Add ‘Most Active Topics’ section on the page. This will contain the most discussed topics together with the relevant tags. There should be an ‘unsubscribe’ button on each topic in case the user does not want to follow the topic anymore |
| May 28th - May 30th |  | Put up tags for ‘followed topics’ and ‘most active topics’ each with a ‘more…’ link to toggle the other hidden tags |
| May 31st - June 3rd |  | Add layout tests for the added features and fix up overall styling while test driving the page for any bugs or missing features. |
| <br>            |  | <br>  |

_**Milestone 2 (Dashboard Page)**_

_The dashboard page is the default first encounter when a user logs into the site. It should be good enough to keep the users interested in what [Publiclab.org](http://Publiclab.org) has to offer. This is how the Dashboard looks as at now:_

\_

![image description](/i/30747.png "Screenshot_from_2019-03-26_12-02-37.png")

The Dashboard appears too crowded by the tags,

The activity section is quite informative but also cluttered and not as presentable.

The social media section is a bit hidden.

Here is the wire frame we could use to style the dashboard and make it look amazing.

**Timeline (Dashboard Page)**

For the highlighted period below; The following milestones can be accomplished on this page:

| Time Allocation |  | Tasks |
|-----------------|--|-------|
| June 4th        |  | Find the perfect image to use for the hero background section at the top with abit of opacity and overlay text as shown in the mockup. |
| June 5th - June 7th |  | Add the ‘Ask a question’ section and below them, 4 of the recent topics in a card like display that a user can click on and be redirected to each of the topic’s page. |
| June 8th - June 10th |  | Research on the most appropriate way to place the three pillars, ‘The Problem, The Collaboration , The Solution’ , also with relevant images and a brief description  that brings out the meaning of each of them |
| June 11th- June 14th |  | Address the Recent Activities section. Here we could put activities into a card like HTML display. Also we could paginate for efficiency since the list scrolls up to the bottom of the page. |
| June 15th       |  | Read on new UI hacks and tips that may better my Ui approaches |
| June 17th -June 18th |  | Add layout tests for the added features and fix up overall styling while test driving the page for any bugs or missing features. Also add FTO issues that may be first timer friendly. |

  
_**Milestone 3(Questions Page)**_

_It is cluttered with tags at first view_

_The question text box is too small and may discourage longer questions_

The display of the questions is detailed but the look can be made better. 

_Here is how the questions page looks now:_  
  

_![image description](/i/30751.png "Screenshot_from_2019-03-26_13-40-36.png")_

For the Questions page, her's the UI wire frame that we could use:

![image description](/i/30750.png "PublicLab_mockups_(4).png")

**Timeline (Questions Page)**

For the highlighted period below; The following milestones can be accomplished on this page:

| Weekly Time Allocation |  | Tasks |
|------------------------|--|-------|
| June 19th - June 25th  |  | Design the top most part of the page. Should have an avatar on the left and a brief description on the right of the avatar. Below these will be a text box to enter your question and the ability to post it by pressing a button. |
| June 25th - June 28th  |  | Have a section for featured questions that give a preview of the questions in cards. The card display should be responsive on smaller screens and vary in how many featured questions to be displayed in what screens. |
| June 28th - July 5th   |  | Do Mobile design. Introduce service workers and AMP(Accelerated Mobile Pages) to cater for the PWA part for responsiveness and variety of screen sizes<br> |
| July 6th- July 7th     |  | Test drive the site and see if there are any bugs or missing features. |
| July 8th - July 10th   |  | Create FTO issues from any missing features that could be first-timer friendly. |
|                        |  | <br>  |

_**Milestone 4(peoples page)**_  

_As at now, this is how the people's page looks:_

![image description](/i/30752.png "Screenshot_from_2019-03-26_14-09-58.png")  

_  
_

_This page could be better displayed using cards rather than rows._

**Timeline (Peoples Page)**

For the highlighted period below; The following milestones can be accomplished on this page:

| Weekly Time Allocation |  | Tasks |
|------------------------|--|-------|
| July 11th - July 18th  |  | Configue the page design to look like the provided UI. This will include using cards to display people rather than rows of data |
| July 19th - July 22nd  |  | Create FTO issues on any remaining bugs and add layout testing. |
| July 22nd - July 23rd  |  | Read more on UI design and new approaches to take when thinking about a User Interface. |
| July 23rd - July 26th  |  | Write blogs on the various new things I have learnt and share with others the things I would have accomplished so far |

_**Milestone 5 (Subscription stats Page)**_

_I worked on the backend functionality of grouping the subscription stats(that were in JSON format) into common subscriber count. This is how the page looked._

![image description](/i/30753.png "Screenshot_from_2019-03-26_14-43-37.png")\_  
\_

It's to be grouped and fixed into this layout:

![image description](/i/30754.png "Screenshot_from_2019-03-26_14-45-12.png")

**Timeline (Subscription Stats page)**

For the highlighted period below; The following milestones can be accomplished on this page:

| Weekly Time Allocation |  | Tasks |
|------------------------|--|-------|
| July 27th - Aug 2nd    |  | Research and settle on a 2D javascript Engine that will help in displaying the subscription stats with 2D shapes as expressed in the mockup. This will involve a series of deep research in order to get a hold of the Javascript Engine. |
| Aug 3rd - Aug 9th      |  | Implement the design using the Javascript Engine. This will involve creating objects, mapping them to the given values. Displaying subscriber count for each tag and on clicking the circles, a pop up with the related tags |
| Aug 10th - Aug 13th    |  | Blog about the Javascript Engine I will have used. |
| Aug 13th - Aug 20th<br>(onwards) |  | Finalize on my Outreachy internship. Creating FTO issues and blogging on the various things I learn plus my experience as an intern. Thank my mentors and continue contributing to publiclab.org<br><br> |

### Needs

I would need all the assistance and guidance I can get from my mentors in everything I do. \_

_I would also ask for resources on UI design so that I can better my design approach_

_Would love guidance with what 2D javascript engine best works for the final milestone_

### Experience

While starting school I learn HTML and CSS with a side of JavaScript but it wasn't my cup of tea back then. In 2016 I was an intern at a coding boot camp where I started learning Ruby on Rails; After the boot camp I drifted from coding once again due to impostor Syndrome. I was getting really discouraged by how much people around me know that I don't. Beginning 2017 I began the journey once again and swore not to quit no matter the circumstances. I went back to coding in Ruby which is the prettiest language ever laid my eyes on. I do Javascript and love to play around with Jquery animations. Earlier this year I began learning a functional paradigm called 'Elixir on Phoenix' alongside Ruby and the experience is fantastic. \_

### Teamwork

### _Mozilla Community_

### _Podii community_

_Agile Ventures Community_

### Passion

_Public lab projects are amazing to work on since they are not just bound to one strategy of doing things. The personnel is welcoming to new ideas and they are very inspiring when it comes to collaboration. I'm passionate about graphics and motion, no wonder my attraction to JavaScript and Jquery libraries._

### Audience

_There are millions of people who visit the public lab website on a daily. I want them to feel the welcoming Ora whenever they visit the site. It's to reach out to people with impostor Syndrome like I used to have, those who don't feel they could achieve much but have so much potential. They need to know that they can actually be part of a community like public lab that welcomes everyone with open arms. This will be a stepping stone for them as it is fro me since they get to learn so much while having fun too._

### Commitment

_From reviews and alumni blogs, I understand that joining Outreachy takes one's full commitment to the project's contribution and collaboration. I am a tonne excited to be part of this journey since I have seen other people grow so much from this, and I'm also excited to grow both skill wise and social wise._
