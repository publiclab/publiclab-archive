I received a [DIY Spectrometry Kit](http://publiclab.org/wiki/dsk) as part of a price on the ['Build My Lab' contest on instructables](http://www.instructables.com/contest/buildmylab/). As I have a 3D printer, I decided to design a 3D printed main body. The new design allows the replacement of the conduit box and wooden block by a purpose designed part. The resulting spectrometer provides a better fit for the camera and the card insert. It is also a bit more robust due to the provision of an integrated clamp for the USB cable, making it more suitable for carrying around. I published a [new Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-spectrometer-using-Public-Lab-DIY-kit/) to show how I did it.

In the future I would like to design a separate stand, for using the spectrometer to analyse samples in standard cuvettes (square 10x10x45mm). Please, leave any comments or suggestions as this will all help to improve the final article!
