###What I want to do or know
We want to know how to calibrate pi NOIR camera with red filter and provide the image processing inside the raspberry pi using python

###Background story
We are tasked to create a portable NDVI camera using raspberry pi. We used raspberry pi 3 with Pi NOIR camera attached to it. We used wratten 25A as our long pass filter. Here is a sample of  the image we have taken:

Is this photo acceptable as an NDVI specimen? and how could i code in python the ndvi processing. I'm trying to manipulate the channels by providing the original NDVI formula but still, no luck. I personally love how ned's photomonitoring plugin do the job but i realy like to put the processing inside the raspberry Pi.
