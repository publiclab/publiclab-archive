How can i validate that the data I obtained using raspi noir camera  are really NIR and NDVI?

I am still new in this topic, and we were tasked to create  a low cost ndvi camera, I understand that using pi noir camera with blue filter, we could get false color chanel that gives NIR(instead of rgb, it would be NIR,NIR,Blue+NIR). My problem is that how can i show or validate that what my camera really produce is NIR or NDVI? I found one multispectral camera in one of the universities near our school, can i use that on validation? And also my professor wants me to show the standards that can prove that NDVI is really acceptable. Please Help me,
