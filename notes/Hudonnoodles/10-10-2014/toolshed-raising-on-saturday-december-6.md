Parking is available in the large lot across the street or directly in front of our building. Please do not park in the large driveway to the right of our building -- it belongs to our down-the-street neighbors

We have a dog! He's very friendly, and will likely sleep on the couch the whole time

Kids are welcome to join --- P&C is a workshop space for kids so there will be plenty for them to do. There may also be a mini-sized honk band rehearsing for some portion of the open hack session. music provided! If you have young ones and want to bring them, please do!
