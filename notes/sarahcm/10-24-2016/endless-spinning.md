When I try upload and calibrate a photo, I get an error message.  I am then able to search for my photo which seems to have loaded in spite of the error message, but when I try to calibrate, the calibration won't load and I just perpetually get the spinning wheel of death (the loading symbol).  thank you for any advice.
