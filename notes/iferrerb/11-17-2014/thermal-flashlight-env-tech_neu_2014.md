###What I want to do
We wanted to see how we could get a full range of light within the apartment, and with the pre-set conditions of the flashlight.



###My attempt and results
We went into a dark bathroom to take pictures of the color variations in the flashlight. We were having a hard time getting the color to change, even when held up to something with a more extreme temperature, so we had to blow directly onto the flashlight to warm it up. It turns out that we did not cut open a second hole in the front of our box for the sensor so it was not able to detect thermal changes as easily. 



###Questions and next steps
Why didn't we see the light changing?
 - We had the sensor covered and our the room temperature was outside of the range    set on the flashlight.


###Why I'm interested
This could be used to explore changes in temperature at different ocean depths, or at increasing distances from factory air space.
