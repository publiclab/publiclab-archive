## About me

I am Ahmad Bolaji, a software developer from Nigeria. 

**Affiliation: **I was a student of the University of Ilorin where I studied chemical engineering and graduated in 2019\.

**Location:** I am currently located in Lagos, Nigeria.

## Project description

```
This project is intended to work on fixing some issues with the current publicLab editor and make it much more usable and with a better experience.

Tasks (These are broken down into 3 3-week long sprints)

Week 1: Study the codebase and get familiar, run tests cases, install.

Wk 2-4: Fix Issues related to test cases in jasmine failing. Reproduce errors in a test, debug test failures as documented and fix errors.

Week 5-7: Fix some issues with the UI/UX of the editor, update non-working styles and convert footnote-styles to inline-linking. Update woofmark library.

Week 8-10: Study the nested structure of the multiple repositories and the role of NPM registry and semantic versioning in such integrated codebase. Fix ES6 compilation issues in babel, Publish a new editor to production.

Week 11-12: Merge PRs, accept Reviews.
```

### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

### Problem

I noticed some components do not function as necessary. A couple of the UI looks broken, like the editor options at the base, sometimes they overlap on the editor itself and make it hard to see the content below. Components like the location detector, the map also. My intention is to take a close look at these UI issues and fix them all before the end of the internship.

The map does not move to the chose location, sometimes it loads forever and page needs to be refreshed. Also, a couple of testsare failing as mentioned in the description which are making it hard to run the project. These issues could be arising due to these test issues. My aim is to debug each of the test cases, analyze the errors and fix them as well.

Lastly, the current version of the projectLab is great and very useful. But a need to fix these issues will mean that a new version will be released and I would be highly honored and proud to be a part of the team that worked on this.

### First-time contribution

I have worked on a [FTO-issue](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/10464) and resolved it with [PR-10479](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/10479). In the process, I also contributed to the tensorflow library and ChrisUI.

### Experience

I started learning to build web applications after seeing a classmate work with it and make money. I started learning javascript and it seemed magical that I could just create beautiful content by writing some code in my editor. So I started learning more about it. I have experience with javascript, typescript, NodeJS and react. recently, I started learning more about the Web3, solidity, Rust and blockchain technologies.  
  
my github repo is on h[ttps://github.com/bolajahmad](http://ttps://github.com/bolajahmad)

### Teamwork
I have worked on hackathon teams, contributed to open projects with friends I met on discord. I can say I am very well with team work and collaboration. I believe in doing your best and being transparent about it. I can use tools like Jira, GitHub Projects, Kanban board to keep track of tasks and stories to work on  

---------

### Passion

I am inspired by projects that have a lot to give but little to gain. I like to work on coding as it gives me a powerful feeling of creation. Working on public lab, I appreciate the effort to create a WYSIWG text editor for public use. 

### Audience
Currently, I would like to give users of the public lab editor the smoothest and best experience possible.

  
### Commitment

Yes, I am fully committed to this. Most of what I do during my days is all about finding projects that i can contribute to, helping to answer some questions on my favorite libraries discord channels. So I definitely have the commitment and time to take part in this
