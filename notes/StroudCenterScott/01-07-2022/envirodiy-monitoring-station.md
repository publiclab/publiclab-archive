Stroud Water Research Center's [EnviroDIY Monitoring Station](https://www.envirodiy.org/mayfly-sensor-station-manual/) is a solar powered, waterproof, cellular-enabled data logging device that can connect to a wide variety of environmental sensors. It is based around the [EnviroDIY Mayfly Data Logger](https://www.envirodiy.org/mayfly/). 

  
[Step-by-step instructions](https://www.envirodiy.org/mayfly-sensor-station-manual/) on assembling, programming, and deploying the EnviroDIY Monitoring Station have been followed by many citizens science and research groups around the world. [Extensive community-based Q&A](https://www.envirodiy.org/forums/) is available to help you troubleshoot during the building and programming process. The EnviroDIY Mayfly Data Logger and all components in the EnviroDIY Monitoring Station are open source (CC as Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0). You can also [purchase a kit](https://www.envirodiy.org/product/envirodiy-monitoring-station-kit/ "https://www.envirodiy.org/product/envirodiy-monitoring-station-kit/") containing all of the hardware needed to build the EnviroDIY Monitoring Station.

  
Data from an EnviroDIY Monitoring Station can be relayed and shared to the [Monitor My Watershed Data Sharing Portal](http://www.monitormywatershed.org). Monitor My Watershed is an open source, free-to-use platform for sharing and visualizing environmental data that is optimized for environmental IoT applications.
