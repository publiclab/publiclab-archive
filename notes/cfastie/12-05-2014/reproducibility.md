The outline below is what happened in my brain when Public Lab people started discussing what a research note is and how to make the information in research notes more useful. There was some of this discussion at the Barnraising last month (photo above, photographer unknown) and more in the last couple of days. Below I am specifically responding to attempts to introduce more reproducibility into the research presented by the Public Lab community. I thought making an outline would prevent me from rambling, but it didn't work.  I hope a lot more gets said about this topic, including refutation of all the points below that deserve it. Some other documents about this have been posted, but I don't know how public they are supposed to be, so I did not link to them here. Feel free to do so in a comment. Also for comments: Does it matter that most research in Public Lab research notes is not reproducible?
