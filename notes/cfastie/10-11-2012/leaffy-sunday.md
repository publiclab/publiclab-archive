We have been puzzling over how to share the photos and videos taken during LEAFFEST in September.  Although I didn't take any, I have accumulated just about everybody else's media, and decided a good way to share them was to make a compilation video. It's almost done, and below is a sneak peak.  This segment includes Sunday morning's activity which managed to record the flight path of a GPS watch attached to the line below a Fled kite. The completed movie will probably be available in a few days.  If you have any media from LEAFFEST that you have not given to me, this is your last chance to have it included.  Thanks to the many camera operators who contributed all the media below.
