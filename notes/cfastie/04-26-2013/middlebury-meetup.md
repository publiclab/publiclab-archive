Join us for a quick gathering and potential test flight of a quadcopter, a kite-borne NDVI camera, and maybe other things. We will meet at 8:00 AM for an hour or two at the [Middlebury College Organic Farm](http://www.middlebury.edu/sustainability/food/mcog) on Route 125 west of campus. Check back here or contact me (cfastie) via my gmail account for last minute changes.
