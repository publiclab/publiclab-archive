<em>Image above: The Middlebury College Organic Farm on July 19, 2011. It won't look anything like this on April 30, but we might get some aerial images anyway. Photo: two stitched photos from a Canon S95 lofted by 9' delta kite.</em>

Join us for a quick gathering and potential test flight of a quadcopter, a kite-borne NDVI camera, and maybe other things. We will meet at 8:00 AM for an hour or two at the [Middlebury College Organic Farm](http://www.middlebury.edu/sustainability/food/mcog) on Route 125 west of campus. Check back here or contact me (cfastie) via my gmail account for last minute changes.
