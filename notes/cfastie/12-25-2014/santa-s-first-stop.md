Twas the night before Christmas when I heard such a clatter  
That I flew to the shop to see what was the matter.  
I found there a fellow like the real Old Man Winter,  
A jolly red elf running my 3D printer.  
.

.  

The PLA was extruding as fast as a whistle,  
The nozzle was zooming like a zigzagging missile.  
He spoke not a word, but went straight to my spatula.  
Toys popped off the platform that were simply spectacular.  
.

.  

With a twist of his wrist he cleared the build plate  
Leaving naught but a warm bed of blue painters tape.  
Then he loaded his sack on the back of his sleigh,  
And away he did dash, with just this to say:  
.

.  
“My elves got too busy, a toy shortage was imminent,  
I left you a gift to make up for the filament.”  
When what to my wondering eyes should appear,  
But a new x-axis cable and shiny extruder gear.  
.

.  


An idler pulley too, and new teflon tubes,  
A five volt regulator, z-axis arms, and silicone lube.  
“Oh Santa” I said, “Now I’ll laugh ‘til I hurt,  
All I wanted for Christmas was a Public Lab T-shirt!”  
.
