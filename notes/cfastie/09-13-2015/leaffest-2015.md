*Above: The third annual LEAFFEST (2014)*  

**WHAT:** An annual meetup to refine Public Lab tools and brainstorm new ones.  
**WHEN: **October 9 to 11 (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday)(Monday is Columbus Day).  
**WHERE:** Chrisâ€™s house in [Salisbury, VT](http://bit.ly/1QxCgMJ).  
**HOW:** Bring a tent and stay the whole weekend. There will be lots of food.  
**WHY:** Because Public Labbers Make Things Better (and also like camping and eating).  

Public Lab Organizers [Chris Fastie](http://publiclaboratory.org/profile/cfastie) and [Ned Horning](http://publiclaboratory.org/profile/nedhorning) will be hosting the gathering. The tentative agenda includes several projects:

[**The Oil Testing Kit**](http://publiclab.org/wiki/oil-testing-kit): Jeff Warren and/or Yagiz Sutcu will lead a work session on improving the performance of the new fluorescence spectrometry kit.  
[**The Turbid Riffle**](http://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/08-25-2015/turbidity-001): Don Blair will lead a work session on turbidity sensors which leverage the Riffle to monitor water quality.  
[**NDVI calibration**](http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/07-22-2015/introducing-the-calibration-plugin-for-imagej-fiji): Ned Horning will lead a work session to test protocols for producing calibrated NDVI values from infrared photos taken by single- and dual-camera infrared systems.  
**Structure from motion:** Chris Fastie will lead a work session to collect and/or process aerial photos to make 3D topographic models of landscapes.  
**Your suggestion:** You should request that we organize a session about an existing or potential Public Lab tool that you would like to learn about or tell others about.

 *Above: This will be the first LEAFFEST held in October when the name LEAFFEST will not be false advertising.*  

Everyone is welcome to attend all or part of the weekend to contribute or learn. We will post more details here as they emerge and also at the [publiclab-northeast Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/publiclab-northeast) where you can ask questions and suggest activities. Questions and suggestions are also welcome in the comments below.

There are 30 [research notes tagged LEAFFEST](http://publiclab.org/tag/leaffest) from the first three LEAFFESTs (2012 to  2014). Let's up the average this year!
