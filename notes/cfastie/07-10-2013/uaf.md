Here are a few infrablue false color infrared images from the campus of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. They are captured with a Canon A810 with Rosco #74 filter which was white balanced on blue origami paper. I saved an "action" in Photoshop which does 1) Autolevels, 2) swaps the blue and green channels, 3) adjusts the hue and saturation.
