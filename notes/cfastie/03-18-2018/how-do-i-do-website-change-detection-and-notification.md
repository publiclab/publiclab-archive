I live in a town where malathion and permethrin are sprayed in a fog along roads to kill mosquitoes in the summer. They are required to notify the public when they spray, but they do this only by posting on a web page. In order to alert the community that spraying will happen, I would like to [monitor this page][1] or maybe one linked there. How can I get an email every time this page is changed? Spraying happens after dark, and the decision to spray might happen late in the day. So I might want to check the page every ten minutes in the afternoon and evening.
