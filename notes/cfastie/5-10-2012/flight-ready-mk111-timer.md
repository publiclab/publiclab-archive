I got the MK111 timer all wired up and integrated into the <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/dual-camera-kit-guide">PLOTS Visible/NIR Camera Tool</a> payload. I still have to endurance test the two 4LR44 batteries, but I will wait to do that in the air -- no reason to waste two $1 batteries and not get any aerial photos.
