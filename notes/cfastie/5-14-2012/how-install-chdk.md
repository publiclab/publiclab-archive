[Update June 2015: This method of installing CHDK is no longer useful. Use [STICK](http://zenoshrdlu.com/stick/stick.html).]

I added a new video to the <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/dual-camera-kit-software">wiki on the PLOTS visible/NIR camera tool</a>.  It has step-by-step instructions for one method of installing CHDK (Canon Hack Development Kit) on a 4GB SD card using a Windows PC. CHDK is required in order to have a timer trigger the camera shutters synchronously.

There are written guidelines at the wiki for installing CHDK on larger SD cards and for using a Mac. There are multiple ways to do these installations.  If you have experiences with other permutations, adding them here or at the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/publiclaboratory">PLOTS Google Group forum</a> could help others use this tool.
