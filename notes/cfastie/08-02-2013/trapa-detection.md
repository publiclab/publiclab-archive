A plan is emerging to try to identify water chestnut (*Trapa natans*) in the [balloon mapping photos](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/07-25-2013/lake-warner-workflow) we took a couple of weeks ago. It's easy to see water chestnut in many of the photos, and with a little practice one can mark individual rosettes quite quickly. But the hope is that after many hours of diligent effort by expert remote sensing professionals, a computer will be able to do this work without much help from us. In the meantime, I have tried the manual method of staring at a few of the photos and marking the patches I think are water chestnut. Don't show this note to the computers, because that would be cheating.

The yellow rectangles are the areas of the two photos below. White circles are patches of vegetation which I think are water chestnut.

Most patches, and even individual plants or rosettes of water chestnut can be distinguished in the lower elevation photos, but smaller patches are not easy to see in the higher photos. Water chestnut has a blue green color that distinguishes it from most of the other vegetation in this lake. The leaves of water chestnut are smaller than those of most of the native plants here, so the texture of patches of water chestnut is often distinctive. These photos have been downsampled to about 70% of the size of the originals, and the "levels" tool in Photoshop has been used to increase dynamic range. Right click, then open in new tab, then Ctrl+ to enlarge (but the site won't show you the full resolution photo!).
