# Nighthawk panoramas

*Above: Planet LEAFFEST. A stereographic projection of a half spherical panorama above Lone Rock Pond.*

Sunday's practice flight of the Nighthawk delta from Paul's Fishing Kites returned some nice photos. I flew a [Saturn V Rig](http://kaptery.com/product/saturn-v-rig) with a PowerShot S100 for an hour and 15 minutes an captured 1474 photos. The SD card filled about five minutes before I landed the rig. That happened at 5:15 PM and the low sun was behind clouds, so many of the later photos are underexposed.

*This could not have been a more perfect day for kiting, except that most of the LEAFFEST people had already headed back to Boston.*

For the first time, I had the S100 record GPS coordinates for each photo. I have kept the GPS feature turned off previously because it uses extra battery power and I didn't know how much it would shorten the session. CHDK says the camera battery is still at about 40%, so it appears that the GPS does not use very much power. I will probably have it on by default from now on.

*The [Saturn V Rig](http://kaptery.com/product/saturn-v-rig) with [SkyShield autoKAP controller](http://kaptery.com/product/skyshield-autokap-controller) and PowerShot S100.*  

The pan/tilt mode running on the [SkyShield autoKAP controller](http://kaptery.com/product/skyshield-autokap-controller) was capturing 25 photos during each cycle which covered everything except the zenith. Each cycle took 72 seconds, so a photo was taken about every three seconds.

*Mount Moosalamoo beyond Lone Rock Pond. Stitched from three photos. The red maples are at their peak color, but most other trees have a long way to go. This is the latest fall color I can remember.*  

Below is a stitched spherical panorama from one cycle of 25 photos. There are 59 of these cycles from this flight so many other panoramas are possible.
