**WHAT:** An annual Public Lab meetup to refine and test DIY tools and brainstorm new ones.  
**WHEN:** September 29 to October 1 (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).  
**WHERE:** Chrisâ€™s house in [Salisbury, VT](http://bit.ly/1QxCgMJ).  
**HOW:** Bring a tent and stay the whole weekend. There will be lots of food.  
**WHY:** Because posting a LEAFFEST research note is a badge of honor.

This is the sixth annual LEAFFEST. Public Lab Organizer [Chris Fastie](https://publiclab.org/profile/cfastie) will be hosting the gathering. Thank you Public Lab for supporting the event again this year. There is no charge for attending LEAFFEST. Everyone is invited. All food will be provided and there are lots of places to set up a tent or otherwise crash. 

There is not yet an agenda for LEAFFEST. Activities will depend on what YOU bring to work on, demonstrate, and try out, and we will post updates if some appropriate themes emerge. We always try to get some cameras in the air and there will be lots of new projects to hear about. Since LEAFFEST 2016, Chris has developed three data logging devices based on Arduino (see the [last 20 research notes here](https://publiclab.org/profile/cfastie)), so he could be compelled to describe what he has learned about DIY environmental data logging. Tours of the [KAPtery](http://kaptery.com/), where environmental science kits are manufactured and distributed, have become a regular feature of LEAFFEST.
