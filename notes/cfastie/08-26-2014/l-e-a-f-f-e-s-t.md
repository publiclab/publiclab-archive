*Above: Group aerie at LEAFFEST 2012.*  

  
* **WHAT**:  An annual meetup to refine Public Lab tools and brainstorm new ones.  
* **WHEN**:  September 13 and 14 (Saturday and Sunday).  
* **WHERE**:  Chrisâ€™s house in [Salisbury, Vermont](http://bit.ly/1QxCgMJ).  
* **HOW**:  Bring a tent and stay the whole weekend. There will be lots of food.  
* **WHY**:  Because Public Labbers like to ***make things better*** (and also like camping and eating).  

Public Lab Organizers  [Chris Fastie](http://publiclaboratory.org/people/cfastie) and [Ned Horning](http://publiclaboratory.org/people/nedhorning) will be hosting the gathering.  The agenda includes at least four projects:

* [**The Oil Testing Kit**](http://publiclab.org/wiki/oil-testing-kit): Jeff Warren will lead a work session to improve the light gathering performance and precision of the new fluorescence spectrometry kit.
* [**The Riffle**](http://publiclab.org/wiki/riffle): Don Blair will lead a field deployment of Riffles and calibration sensors to explore the capabilities of this emerging water quality sensor.
* [**Infragram calibration**](http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/06-23-2014/calibrating-raw-images-a-step-toward-jpeg-calibration): Ned Horning will lead a work session to test protocols for producing calibrated NDVI values from infrared photos taken by single- and dual-camera infrared systems. 
* **Your suggestion**: You will request that we organize a session about an existing or potential Public Lab tool that you would like to learn about or try or tell others about.

Everyone is welcome to attend all or part of the weekend to contribute or learn.  We will post more details here as they emerge and also at the [publiclab-northeast Google Group]( https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/publiclab-northeast) where you can ask questions and suggest activities.  Questions and suggestions are also welcome in the comments below.  

There are [**24 research notes** tagged LEAFFEST](http://publiclab.org/tag/leaffest) from the first events in 2012 and 2013. Let's up the average this year!
