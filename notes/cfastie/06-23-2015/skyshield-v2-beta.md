*Above: all the 3D printed parts for five Saturn V Rigs.*  
.  
The next version of the SkyShield autoKAP controller is ready for you to test. There are a few kits available for sale to anyone interested in trying a microcontroller on a kite aerial photography rig and posting a couple of research notes about your experiences. The KAPtery is offering a package with a ready-to-fly [SkyShield and a kit to build a Saturn V Rig and Picavet](http://kaptery.com/product/saturn-v-rig-beta-2) suspension all for $115.  
.

*The new version of SkyShield has a DIP switch to select the pan/tilt/shoot regime in the field. The package includes a completely assembled and tested SkyShield and Arduino Nano, and should be the last version to say "SKY-SWEEP" on it (#CollectorsItem).*  
.  
The package includes everything (except the camera) you need to build a working motorized pan/tilt KAP rig for systematically taking photos to be stitched into panoramas ([see some here](http://publiclab.org/tag/half-spherical)). The package requires several hours of assembly, including a tiny bit of soldering, and I am eager to hear about how to modify things to improve the kit building process. All the hardware designs and software are open source, and it would be great to hear if you have been able to incorporate some of this work into your own projects.

*The package includes everything here except the camera. Some assembly required.*  
.  
I will be doing field work in early July and will not be able to ship any orders from the KAPtery then. So this week is the last chance in a while to place a KAPtery order for [this package](http://kaptery.com/product/saturn-v-rig-beta-2) or a [Redstone Rig Kit](http://kaptery.com/product/redstone-rig-kit) or other kits.
