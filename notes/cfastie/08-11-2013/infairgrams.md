Replacing red light with near infrared light makes some fun photographic effects possible. That replacement is how [Infragram cameras](http://publiclab.org/wiki/near-infrared-camera) work, and is the key to revealing plant health. But by tweaking how the infrared light is displayed, it is possible to make some dramatic images. Here are a few Infragram photos from the Addison County Fair and Field Days, the biggest agricultural fair in Vermont. These Infragram photos were taken with a Canon A810 with Rosco #74 filter, and all were tweaked in Photoshop.

The original Infrablue photo of the demolition derby was also [processed at infragram.org](http://infragram.org/show/ACFair-13-08-08-181-9.JPG) which now accepts full resolution files.
