<p>.</p>
I have always wanted a good map of my vegetable garden, but the yard is too small to fly a kite. This was no obstacle for Ned Horning, who visited this week with a huge carp pole and a quadcopter. The quadcopter story does not have a completely happy ending, but we got some good photos from atop a 9.4 meter fishing pole.  This was a [Ron Thompson Gangster Pole](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thompson-Gangster-Including-Extra-Fishing/dp/B0014FVYIC), which is extremely lightweight and easy to use. It has eight sections which each add about 1.3 m, but the uppermost one is too thin to support a camera, so the total length we used was 9.4 m. You can see this type of pole catching fish in [this mesmerizing video](http://youtu.be/FgpjGRUq5qE).

The video below was taken by accident when the camera was touched and somehow switched from running a CHDK intervalometer script to recording video.

<p></p><em>I measured out a five meter grid of golf balls to make it easier to align the photos into a map.</em>
<p>.</p>
![Grid.JPG](/system/images/photos/000/001/098/medium/Grid.JPG)
<p></p><em>In Photoshop, I drew a grid (red lines) with extra lines for the paths (blue lines) and matched up the intersections with the golf balls in the photos. A denser grid would have been better so each photo included at least 3 balls. The balls were only in the lawn and paths, so some photos included only two balls, which is not enough. Even three balls per photo allows multiple alignment solutions, I think.</em>
