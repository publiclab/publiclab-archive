Last week Google+ introduced “Communities” where like minded users can share stuff. There is already a community for “[Citizen Science]( https://plus.google.com/communities/101870854201413854727)” with 706 members and four moderators (I’m not sure what they do).   Google+ does not have half the number of active users that Facebook has. But it is growing about as fast as Facebook was when it had a similar number of users (about half a billion).  I have also joined the communities for [Ecology](https://plus.google.com/communities/106823432582310903544),[Plant Ecology]( https://plus.google.com/communities/110900928395078456677), [Kite Aerial Photography]( https://plus.google.com/communities/102845455610028515802), and [Makers, Hackers, Artists & Engineers](https://plus.google.com/communities/112845006884148391862) (14407 members!). Now it will be even easier to find people who know more than I do about stuff I thought I was really smart in.
