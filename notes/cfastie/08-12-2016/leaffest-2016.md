**WHAT:** An annual Public Lab meetup to refine and test DIY tools and brainstorm new ones.  
**WHEN:** September 16 to 18 (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).  
**WHERE:** Chrisâ€™s house in [Salisbury, VT](http://bit.ly/1QxCgMJ).  
**HOW:** Bring a tent and stay the whole weekend. There will be lots of food.  
**WHY:** Because there is no arguing with tradition.

This is the fifth annual LEAFFEST. Public Lab Organizer [Chris Fastie](https://publiclab.org/profile/cfastie) will be hosting the gathering. Thank you Public Lab for supporting the event again this year. There is no charge for attending LEAFFEST! Everyone is invited. All food will be provided and there are lots of places to set up a tent or otherwise crash. 

Rumor has it that a solar hot air balloon will be attending LEAFFEST this year. Other exciting activities will depend on what YOU bring to work on, demonstrate, and try out. We always seem to get some cameras in the air and there will be lots of new projects to hear about. Hmmm, what sensors could we put on (in) a hot air balloon?

*Above: This LEAFFEST tradition will become a contest this year. The best refrigerator Scrabble solution that is tweeted (#leaffest2016) will win a fabulous prize. Other *ad hoc* contests could also arise, and cool prizes ([3D printed digital sundials](http://kaptery.com/article/3d-printed-digital-sundial/), KAPtery gear) will be awarded to all winners. You could win a complete kit to build an [Aerobee aerial photography rig](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/07-05-2016/the-aerobee-rig).*

There are [42 research notes at Public Lab tagged leaffest.](https://publiclab.org/tag/leaffest?page=1) A goal this year will be to surpass our annual record of 13 notes from [2013.](https://publiclab.org/tag/leaffest2013)
