On Saturday afternoon at IFarm last weekend, aerial photos were taken from multirotor and fixed wing aircraft, and from a kite. When the powered flights were  finished, I made my first ever flight with a [Redstone Rig](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/03-27-2014/the-redstone-rig-is-ready). Even though I have been encouraging others to [print them and buy them from me](http://kaptery.com), I had not yet gotten around to trying a Redstone Rig. Under a Fled kite and a yellow Picavet, with a Canon S95 shooting every five seconds, the rig worked just as expected.

*A Canon S95 on the Redstone Rig under a Picavet suspension.*

I pointed the camera in the general direction of the Tuckaway Farm complex, and below is a stitched panorama from six photos.

When the rig came down, we got some practice making aeries (aerial selfies).

.  
That's Jeff, Ned, Don, Christine, Abe, Louis, Severine, and Graham.  

There is more to come from the other flights that day, but the stitching job from the Bixler flight is slow.  Maybe I will report on the quadcopter flight with Mobius ActionCam Infragram next.
