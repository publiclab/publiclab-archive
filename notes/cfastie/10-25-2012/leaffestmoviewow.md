Open Source does it again!  We discussed making a documentary of LEAFFEST, but no plan emerged, and I never took any video or stills.  Several others recorded some of the action, and true to the open source creed, lots of this media was made available. The best way I could think of to archive it was to compile it into a video. And here it is.  I think this is the first time I have made a video with other people's material.  It's quite liberating.  Enjoy.

Several [research notes from LEAFFEST activities](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/leaffest), including early versions of parts of this movie, are now posted.
