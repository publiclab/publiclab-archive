The interaction of infrared light and water can influence our interpretation of near infrared photos taken to investigate aquatic or marine plants. This question most recently came up last week when @code4maine asked about [using Infragram cameras to map eelgrass beds along the Maine coast](http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/10-01-2014/question-can-an-infra-red-modified-camera-distinguish-between-eelgrass-and-other-aquatic-flora).  I was thinking about this issue as I was testing some new infrared cameras this weekend.  This pair of photos was somewhat revealing:  
.  
[![PoolNIR2k.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/007/326/medium/PoolNIR2k.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/007/326/original/PoolNIR2k.jpg)  
*A swimming pool in normal visible light (left) and in pure near infrared light (right).*  
.  
Two differences between water's interaction with visible and near infrared (NIR) light are conspicuous in these photos:  

1. **Absorption**: NIR light is absorbed by water more strongly than visible light. The pool looks brighter in the visible light photo because more of the light is  transmitted through the water and less is absorbed. The longer the path through water that any light has to follow, the more of it is absorbed. But NIR light is absorbed faster, so the pool steps get darker faster with depth in the NIR photo. It looks like very little NIR light can pass through more than a meter of water (the pool bottom is not visible).  
.

*[Light absorption coefficient of pure water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Water_absorption_coefficient_large.gif). The absorption coefficient (y axis) is a log scale so NIR light (e.g. 760 nm) is absorbed 10 times faster than orange light (625 nm).*  
.  
2. **Reflection**: You can barely see some clouds reflected in the surface of the pool in the RGB photo, but the clouds and tree are clearly reflected in the NIR photo. This is not because NIR light is reflected more strongly than visible light. I think the reflection is just easier to distinguish because so little NIR light passes through water and it appears dark.  
.

*NIR is reflected less by water (the "Sea") than is visible light. But reflections are easier to distinguish because so little NIR light passes through the water and it is much darker than the reflections.*  
.

*Here is another example of the apparent difference in reflection from the surface of water recorded in visible and NIR light.*  
.  
Aquatic or marine plants that are floating or emergent can be studied with aerial infrared photography, but plants under more than about a meter of water are probably not very visible in NIR photos.
