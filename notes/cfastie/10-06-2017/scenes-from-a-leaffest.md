Share a few of your LEAFFEST photos in a comment below.  

LEAFFEST went very smoothly this year, maybe because we are getting really good at LEAFFEST. It was a smaller crowd than in the past few years, and that meant we could move nimbly between projects.

_Above: Agenda for Saturday. The red checks indicate agenda items that were addressed. The photographic prints were taken with an actual Polaroid camera._

Will and Katie focused on using a Raspberry Pi Zero W to take microscopic photos of dust. I'll let them explain why they were doing that.

_Above: Agenda for Sunday. Center diagram is a one-point perspective drawing of a Raspberry Pi microscope. Lower left diagram is a three-point perspective drawing of the same thing from the viewpoint of a piece of dust in the petri dish (where there is a man and dog). Both diagrams by J. Warren although one was retouched by an unpaid intern._

This was the first LEAFFEST to fall on the first of October when a repeat photo is taken from the backyard every year. The 11 years of photos in this series suggest that foliage color in Vermont is not something we should take for granted.

_Above: One of these photos is not like the others. Also, the last three are more green than the others. This is either a trend or natural variability. Tune in next year for more._

_Above: LEAFFEST project -- Use a freezer to keep beverages cold without freezing them._

_Above: LEAFFEST solution -- Use a KAPtery Nano Data Logger to record and display the temperature inside the freezer. BME280 sensors were inside (left) and outside (lower right) the freezer._

_Above: LEAFFEST trick -- Place a few gallons of water in the bottom of the freezer for thermal mass._

_Above: LEAFFEST result -- It worked pretty well._

Thanks to Public Lab for sponsoring another LEAFFEST. It makes a really big difference to see other Public Lab folk at least once per year.

Below are research notes and questions posted about LEAFFEST 2017\. Some of the questions have been answered, but some are mostly for organizing the agenda and some are more or less rhetorical.
