The video below suggests that I had a plan for this new spectrometer, but that plan changed every day as the device came together in the last couple of weeks.  Stuff I found in the garage and at the hardware store altered the design, and my observations on the [SpectroBench 2000]( http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/2-5-2013/grating-angle) completely changed the final dimensions and angles. The angles above could still change, but I'm not planning on changing the slit-to-grating distance.

Below is the first calibration spectrum of a compact fluorescent lamp.  I think I can get a little bit more resolution out of it, mostly by narrowing the entrance slit.  We will see.

Ebert's first calibration spectrum of a compact fluorescent lamp. The data were downloaded from SpectralWorkbench.org as csv and graphed in Excel then overlain on the spectral image.</div>
