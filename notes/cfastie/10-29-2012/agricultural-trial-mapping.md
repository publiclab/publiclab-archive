<em>NDVI image of part of the Lee, NH cover crop field trial we mapped by balloon in May, 2012. Four plots treated with high-carbon wood ash are distinct from adjacent plots which received different treatments. This image was created with Ned Horning's ImageJ plugin using a new histogram stretching option and a new color table Ned created for NDVI images.</em>

I never found out whether there was a place to display maps and posters at LUMCON during the Public Laboratory Barnraising this weekend in Cocodrie, Louisiana. So a poster session has not been offically organized, but I needed motivation to finish a mapping project from last May, so I made a poster to take.  Bill Hegman, who attended LEAFFEST last month, printed it for me today, but you don't have to go to Cocodrie to see it, and you don't even have to wait for the Barnraising to see it. The poster is embedded below from gigapan.com.  If you really want to read it, [go here so you can see it full screen.](http://gigapan.com/gigapans/117582)
