*Above: The height of the compost pile dropped about a foot in a week of cooking. The temperature probes dropped less so they extend farther above the pile. This changed the relationship between the sensors and the center of the pile.*

I left the Riffle in the compost pile for 5.5 additional days unattended and it logged every five minutes. That is a total of one week of logging without recharging the battery. I would have continued the logging, but the compost is now spread around the garden.

*Above: In a week the pile was reduced to about 80% of its original volume (the wire cage was originally filled to above the wire).*

*Above: The temperature of the pile stayed high all week. The highest temperature reached was 69°C (156°F) on the third day. It's too bad the garden needed the compost because the pile would have cooked for a few more days.*

*Above: The temperature and humidity record from the DHT22 sensor in the jug above the compost pile. Some of the days were cool and rainy, so the diurnal pattern is not very tidy here.*

*Above: The battery voltage dropped steadily all week. The temporary recoveries might be when the Nalgene bottle holding the Riffle and battery got warmed in the sun.*

The sketch running on the Riffle is attached to the [previous note](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/06-09-2016/compost-is-hot-says-riffle). It is based on Kina's original sketch with the buggy SD library.
