For some of us, the two-day Northeast Barnraising got started early Saturday with a high tide paddle on the Jones River. By mid morning, almost 30 members of the Public Lab community heard from Pine duBois and Karen Vale about Jones River Watershed Association and Cape Cod Bay Watch, and the rest of the day was spent in workshops on various current and emerging environmental tools. On Sunday we heard from Glorianna Davenport about the Tidmarsh Restoration Project and Living Observatory. The photos below are also in [this Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisfastie/sets/72157644686032239/) with a few others.
