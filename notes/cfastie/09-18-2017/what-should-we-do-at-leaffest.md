I am predicting early fall color this year, so it is scientifically guaranteed to be beautiful in two weeks.

Jeff Warren's plan is to start LEAFFEST by asking everyone what question they want to ask at LEAFFEST [like he plans to do at the Barnraising](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-15-2017/what-questions-will-you-bring-to-the-barnraising). By the end of that session we should not only have a plan for LEAFFEST, but we will know each other better and be prepared to find answers to all the burning questions.

To pre-game this agenda-building and idea-sharing process, let's use this **Question** feature to suggest some possible activities for LEAFFEST.

Why the **Question** feature?

1. Post your suggested activity as an **Answer** below (not a comment).
2. Other people can **Comment** on that idea.
3. Other people can **Like** (star) that idea.

These can be ideas for activities that you would like to lead or activities that you would like someone else to lead (please specify).

This will allow everyone to better prepare (what to bring, what to expect, whether to stay home, etc.).

I will seed the cloud by posting some ideas (**Answers**) below. Your ideas can be as terse or as comprehensive as you desire.

Please let us know what kind of stuff you would like to do at LEAFFEST this year. Post your ideas where it says "Post an Answer" below. Thanks.
