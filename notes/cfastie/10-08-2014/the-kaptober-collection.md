# The KAPtober Collection

This weekend I hosted some family in Vermont and we combined leaf peeping with kite photography. We flew all five rigs in the KAPtober Collection which has just been posted at the [KAPtery](http://kaptery.com/). The KAPtober Collection includes three dual-camera infrared rigs and two single camera rigs, and we captured oblique aerial photos and some vertical mapping photos. The KAPtober Collection incorporates higher quality cameras than I usually use, including the Canon PowerShot S100. The S100 seems to be the ideal camera for kite and balloon photography.

Most of the cameras in this collection were refurbished cameras from Canon. These looked pristine when I bought them and are obviously not used cameras, but may be extra inventory or something like that. One dual rig uses my personal used PowerShot S95 cameras. These are well-treated used cameras in good working order.  My plan is to upgrade to the S100 (it has GPS!)

*The infrared converted cameras all have Wratten 87 filters replacing their IR block filter and make rather intriguing photos of plants and landscapes. This was taken by a converted S95.*

For more results, and to see photos of the rigs, check out the [KAPtery](http://kaptery.com). I'm afraid two of the five new rigs have already been purchased. But I have already ordered four more S100s, so we should be restocked in a couple of weeks. And three KAPtober rigs are still available.
