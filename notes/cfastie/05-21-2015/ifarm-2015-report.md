IFarm 2015 was this past weekend in Lee, New Hampshire. This was the fourth annual meet-up to share progress and ideas about providing richer information to farmers. There are a few photos below, but [many more in a Google story](https://plus.google.com/u/0/116103622078305917397/posts/FuMVjSTrGck). This is the first time I have tried this, and it has potential. There is no option to embed the media, so you have to follow the link above to see the whole story.

*Don stuck this thing on my Redstone KAP rig to see if he could get telemetry from a flying camera indicating that it was still taking photos. He could! And for under $20.*
