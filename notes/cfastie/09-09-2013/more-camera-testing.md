On Sunday at LEAFFEST Jeff continued the camera test by repeating Saturday's scene in different light (brighter shade under blue sky) and a new scene by the garden. In addition to photos from each webcam with two different Rosco filters, we also captured RGB photos and infrablue photos with two or three Powershots. 

One of the infrablue Powershots, the Superblue G11, can save two different custom white balances. I took photos of the second scene with each white balance setting, but the G11 was capturing only camera raw files. When these were imported into Adobe Lightroom, they were displayed without applying the custom presets. But when I opened these raw files in IrfanView, the presets were applied. So the Canon raw files have the preset information embedded, but Lightroom does not use it. I saved as jpg from IrfanView to get the images below. The white balance tool in Lightroom was not able to recreate the white balance setting by clicking on the same gray card in the photo that was used to white balance the camera. Not even close.
