[LEAFFEST ](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/08-26-2014/l-e-a-f-f-e-s-t)is only a week away, and I'm sure you are as excited as I am that this year LEAFFEST falls on the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Baltimore. Through the early light of dawn on September 14, 1814, Francis Scott Key saw that an American flag still flew over Fort McHenry despite 25 hours of bombardment from British ships. In parts of Baltimore there will be a week of festivities to mark this Defenders' Day (a legal holiday in Maryland), and I am pleased to announce a special collection of mapping rigs offered by the [KAPtery](http://kaptery.com) to commemorate this event.

*The Titan 2 IR Oriole Edition Rig*  
.  
The 2014 LEAFFEST Line includes two dual-camera infrared rigs and one single-camera super-red Infragram rig. All include cameras converted to capture NIR light and are completely assembled, configured, ready-to-fly rigs.

*The Titan 2 IR Oriole Edition Rig*  
.  
The [Titan 2 IR Oriole Edition](http://fastie.net/product/titan-2-ir-oriole/) sports the fabulous Maryland state colors and two Canon A590 cameras for producing four band images (RGB and NIR). A timer allows perfect synchronization of photo pairs.

*A photo pair taken by the Oriole Edition Rig (RGB and NIR) and the false color IR and NDVI images derived from that pair.*  
.  
The [Titan 2 IR Raven Edition](http://fastie.net/product/titan-2-ir-ravens/) sports the engaging, musty colors of the Baltimore Ravens NFL team and two Canon A4000 cameras. As in the Oriole, one camera has had its IR block filter replaced with a Wratten 87 filter so it captures only near infrared light.  
.

*An oblique photo pair taken by the Ravens Edition Rig (RGB and NIR) and the false color IR and NDVI images derived from that pair.*  
.  
The single camera rig is the [LEAFFEST Edition Super Redstone Rig](http://fastie.net/product/super-redstone-leaffest/), and is the sassiest addition to the 2014 LEAFFEST Line, sporting crisp fall colors and a Canon A4000 converted to Wratten 25A super-red Infragram.

*The LEAFFEST Edition Super Redstone Rig for single-camera infrared plant health analysis.*

*A super-red photo taken by the LEAFFEST Super-red Rig (top), a false color infrared image from that photo (NRG), and a normalized difference vegetation index image from the photo (NDVI).*  
.  
I had hoped to have the entire 2014 LEAFFEST Line on display at LEAFFEST, but the Raven edition was purchased before I posted this note, so I will ship it tomorrow. At about the same time, FedEx delivered three new Canon A2300 cameras, and the mailman delivered a new spool of deep orange PLA filament. So it's back to work for me and the MakerBot.  

Don't forget to register for [LEAFFEST ](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/08-26-2014/l-e-a-f-f-e-s-t)so we can plan the food and agenda and so everyone can see the complete [list of attendees](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApRLDm8W39oxdFRkdnVjYjJCdlNLdl9vTnk1X25YVFE&usp=drive_web#gid=0).
