###When, where, what
Tues, Feb. 24 @ 5PM ET - Sensor Journalism Kickoff with Fergus Pitt, Tow Center for Digital Journalism
Sun, March 8 @ 1PM ET - Sensor Design and Deployment with Travis Hartman (KBIA noise pollution project), Matt Schroyer (DustDuino)
Sun, March 15 @ 2PM ET - Toward an Educational Module for Sensor Journalism with Catherine D'Ignazio (Emerson College, MIT Center for Civic Media), Don Blair (Public Laboratory of Science), Abbey Collins (Emerson College), Amy Schmitz Weiss (San Diego State University)
Sun, March 22 @ 2PM ET - Internet of Things & Smart Cities with Yodit Stanton (OpenSensors.io), Rob von Kranenberg (theinternetofthings.eu), Michael Wayne (Qualia Networks)
Sun, March 29 @ 2PM ET - Sensor calibration and certification with Puneet Kishor (Creative Commons)

###Background
Speakers in this month long series include practitioners, educators, developers, experimenters, and supporters of sensor journalism to share and discuss their work, then hold a brief Q&A afterward. We hope to expand on existing research on sensor journalism, as captured by the Tow Center for Digital Journalism’s Sensors & Journalism report, along with best practices, as learned through experience and experiment (e.g. [DustDuino](http://publiclab.org/wiki/dustduino), the Open Water Project). Everyone’s invited — including you! 

All the sessions will be archived and hosted on the OKCast website in an effort to build a working knowledge base for sensor journalism beyond informal discussions and meetings on and offline.
