# Introduction:

In this note, you'll be guided step-by-step on how to get started on Transifex and start translating! Transifex is used for the internationalization of projects, which is PublicLab in our case. I have translated some strings to Arabic as a task in Google Code-In 2016\. The interface of Transifex is really user-friendly and professional, you'll learn how to use it in no time!

# Step 1: Registering:

First of all, you'll have to create an account on [Transifex][1], it's easy, you can either add your details or connect your account to GitHub, Google+ or Facebook. Fill in the details you'll be asked for!

# Step 2: Choosing a Project:

After you have successfully registered, you'll have to join a team in order to start translating their project. You can do so by going to [Explore][2], which you'll find in the navigation bar of your Dashboard.

Then you'll choose a project or search for one, click on "Join Team", then choose your language, if you can't find it, then request language from the below section of the team. You'll have to wait for your requested language to be approved. Otherwise, just click join team and an admin should accept your request to join.

# Step 3: Let's Translate!

Now that you've joined registered and joined a team, let's get to the fun part and start translating! When you're at the team's project page, click on Recourses on the left-hand side of the page. You'll be redirected to a page that has all the project website's pages. Choose one that you wish to translate, then select the language you want to translate to.

You'll be seeing next an awesome interface that you'll understand how it works in no time. Just translate the string and click save! Go the next one! Repeat!

# Closure:

That's it, hope you got everything right! If you have any questions, leave it in the comments below, or you can watch my video tutorial on how to get started in no time!

Good Luck Translating!
