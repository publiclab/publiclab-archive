hello! my name is julia masters and i'm working as the organizing and advocacy fellow! i live in chicago, illinois and am very excited to get immersed in the great community science in this community ~~

i currently work as a municipal planner to help cities and towns create climate action plans. my focus through this work has been on equitable community engagement, and to uplift regenerative solutions to our carbon free transition.

for this photo, I took from the third floor balcony of my apartment building! in chicago, many back stairs are made from wood, so it was a good balancing spot for my phone. just like community science, thinking about the factors to find a perch for a high-range photo was filled with questions of where/what/how?

looking forward to working with you all!
