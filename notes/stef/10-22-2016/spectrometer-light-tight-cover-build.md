###What I want to do
Having removed the IR filter from my spec camera, the sensitivity increased dramatically where before the modification the spectrometer worked with the existing cover. In the new configuration the spectrometer was very sensitive to light leakage through the cover. This will work with the @stoft spec upgrades.

###This is what you will need.

###My attempt and results
I cut 2 pieces of 100lb cardstock to size and a piece of heavy duty aluminum foil (not the thin stuff at the dollar store) and marked the inner lines for the bends.
Don't forget the wax paper for your working surface!

I brushed on the contact cement very sparingly onto the one long edge of the cardstock and put on the aluminum foil leaving and edge exposing the paper. Brushed on more cement to the foil and attached the inside paper that was marked previously and then made a 90 degree bend.

I then bent the last 90 degree flap and brushed on sparingly the cement and glued the other side.

This is the finished cover.

### Next steps
Many may not realize that light leakage can disrupt sensitive measurement made with the spectrometer and should be aware of that possibility.
I have NOT made any tests with the original spectrometer case as shipped (V03) I need to further look into the spectral bandwidth of the stock webcam without the IR filter.

###Why I'm interested
I need a stable platform to do further investigation of Ag nano particles focusing on the reflective and transmissive characteristics.
