\###What I want to do or know
Would increasing the sampling rates available beyond the 640 that SW uses to analyze the data to at least the available native pix capture of current image sensors eg 1280 + improve the resolution to be able to see more clearly the Fraunhofer lines? Or am I just chasing my tail? See my captures with Sun, Sky tags.
