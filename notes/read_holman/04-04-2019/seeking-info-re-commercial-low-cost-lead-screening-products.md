Hi all -

I'm doing a lit review for a project and am hoping you can help. 

I'm seeking published literature that evaluates commercially available low-cost lead screen products.

 - Products like the [3M test swabs][1] or the [First Alert test kit][2]
   (for paint/surfaces)
 - Products like the [Water Safe colorimetric
   strips][3] (for water)

Note: These are not mail-in services, but rather at-the-source screeners.

I have found one peer reviewed article, but it's 20 years old. And I have found MANY articles in consumer-facing outlets like Popular Science and Real Simple magazine, etc, but those are of consumers doing their own "tests". No real scientific rigor. There is also [this EPA website][4], but it's not even close to covering the market.

**Do you know of any published papers on the topic? (Including any put out by a gov agency)** If so, please do share them here.

I'd also accept write-ups that aren't in peer-reviewed outlets but clearly document methods that hold scientific water. 

Thanks!
