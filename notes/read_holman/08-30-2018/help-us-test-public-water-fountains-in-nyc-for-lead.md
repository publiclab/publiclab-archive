This is both an announcement and a question. 

  
The Announcement: There's an amazing startup community science effort spearheaded by CitizenSpring.org to test all the public water fountains in NYC for lead. // The Question: Any chance you can help out? 

  
If there's any interest, if you're in NYC, or if you know folks in NYC that you think may be interested, please jump in here and let's connect, brainstorm, talk out the details, etc.
