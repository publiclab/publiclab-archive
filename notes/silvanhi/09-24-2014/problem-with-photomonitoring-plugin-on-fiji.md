###What I want to do
I'd like to import the .lut files of Ned Hornings PhotoMonitoring plugin on my mac.
###My attempt and results
I want to produce and analyse NDVI images. I did manage to run the plugin on windows but I changed to Mac recently.
###Questions and next steps
In the Photo monitoring description it says that I have to copy the files into the proper file directory of the "fiji.app". Unfortunately I cant find this directory on my Mac. Also the app itself is named as "fiji" and not as "fiji.app". Can somebody help me on that subject?
