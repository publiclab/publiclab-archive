###What I want to do
making a simple and exact schemical  spectroscopy 
###My attempt and results
I making the Box but I cant making simple adgustable  slite

###Questions and next steps
how can I made  an adjustable slite  and  how can i made a grating   with mirrore
###Why I'm interested
 I like to  use this instrument   in analytical  chemistry 


thanks  a lot
