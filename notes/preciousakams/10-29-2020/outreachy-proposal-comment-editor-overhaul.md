### Teamwork

At SheHacks Africa, interns were grouped into teams, each team had to peach a project and business model at the end of the program. as one of the team leads I had to get my team organized and ensured we had a project and business model.

### Passion

What attracts me to this project, is the environmental impact achieved through open technology

### Audience

By creating awareness about our environmental challenges and proffering solutions to these problems, we are enlightening people and creating a more environmentally cautious community, which will be beneficial to all in the long run.

Commitment

I understand this is a serious commitment, equivalent to a full time summer job, I don't have commitments schedule for the duration of this program.
