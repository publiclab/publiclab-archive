I am a high school teacher. My students and I want to eventually build a fusor. We are currently in the process of building a 'star-in-a-jar' rudimentary apparatus. We ordered a high voltage power supply (claims 60 kV at 12 mA) that is supposed to be for electrostatic precipitators from China on ebay. Its input is 220 V so we have a 110 to 220 V converter plugged into a variac that we keep at 110 V. The high voltage power supply has two potentiometers, one we assume is to turn up the voltage. We do not know what the other one is for. We have this hooked up to a stainless steel coat hanger inner grid with a 1/4 inch copper pipe as outer grid in a large mason jar with a PVC lid. The inner grid is encased in a 25% ceramic plus 75% 'plaster of paris' hardened mixture. We made this by using an outer paper cylinder to drop the wet mixture in. Then we sealed both ends with tape and kept it in a 200 C oven for 24 hours. We then removed the paper and tape. Only the spherical grid at the end is exposed inside the Mason Jar. Our vacuum system is a 3 CFM rotary vane pump that the brochure says will go down to 5 Pa absolute or 38 microns approximately. We are using play-dough to tightly clamp the PVC lid on the mason jar since we cannot exactly find a matching ID. Our gauge on the rotary vane vacuum pump goes down to minimum hence we are assuming that we are operating at approximately < 100 microns; which should be good enough to get a plasma. Our issue is that we do see a plasma but it is at the upper end of the Mason Jar, i.e. where the inlet for the ceramic encased inner grid and the copper tubing is. It is purple in color. I will ask my students to post a video of the plasma as well as pictures next week at this site. We think we may either too deep - or not too much of a vacuum. We are going to run again tomorrow with the vacuum pump shut off to see if we get a plasma at slightly higher pressures. Once we post the pictures and video, any suggestions on how to get the plasma at the center will be welcome.  
We realize this is obviously the first step toward eventual fusion. We anticipate at least getting to 'jump off' point by this academic year end (May 2018). We have contacted a deuterium supply. We have ordered and received a gas regulator. We are in the process of looking at ordering a thermocouple pressure gauge, oil diffusion pump, needle valve, and assorted piping and valves. We also plan to build a (8 inch) stainless steel fusor from ss plates with 4 ports (vacuum, high voltage feedthrough, deuterium supply, and porthole). We will use powdered silver kept in a moderator to detect neutrons. The idea is that thermal neutrons will convert the silver to cadmium with emission of gamma rays, which we can detect using a geiger counter.

  
A shared link to our video appears below. The video may not play when you click on the link. However, there is a download option available so that you may download to your computer and play it using your computer apps. This is what I had to do as well.

This was written by a friend and I want to help them out with any theories or ideas to help improve their replication. The lack of quality in materials is a little concerning for high schoolers.
