So there are several types and sources of radiation occurring in our world both naturally occurring and due to industries. Natural Occurring Radiation Materials (NORM) is all around us both in large and small quantities. Some of the natural occurring radiation materials include terrestrial NORM and Cosmogenic Norm. Industries that produce NORM are the coal energy industry, coal mining,oil and gas production as well as metal, smelting, mineral sands, tin production, tantulum and niobium, Rare Earth Elements (RRE), uranium production, phosphates and fertilizer production and the list goes on and on.

Some of the more common household items emit trace elements of radiation as well. For instance this is a small list of building materials that contain NORM: concrete, Aerated concrete, clay bricks, sand-lime bricks and sandstone, natural building stones, natural gypsum, cement, tiles, and phosphogypsum,

In fact, two common household items that emit radiation are ceramic coffee mugs and granite countertops.

MY HYPOTHESIS
I believe that granite counter tops will record more radiation emission than a ceramic mug but less radiation from the sun.

The Test
I will be using dosimeter monitors to measure radiation exposure within the ceramic mug (not the same mug as the above picture) and to test the exposure from my granite counter tops in the kitchen. I will also use one dosimeter to measure the UV radiation from the sun for the purpose to compare the exposure rates from all three sources.

The Results
The dosimetry reports will show the radiation exposure depending on the source, if known. Here is a sample report of how the exposure is measured and reported. ([www.dosimeterbadge.com](http://www.dosimeterbadge.com)) All reports are show in MR (millirem).Picture Credit:
