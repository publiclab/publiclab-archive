We joined South Durban Community Environmental Alliance (SDCEA) and groundWork South Africa in a discussion to learn about 25 years of successful organizing and air quality advocacy using the DIY air monitoring tool, the Bucket, in South Africa. We discussed the history of the Bucket, its use as a campaign tool, and success stories from South Durban. During this OpenHour we also previewed the updated Bucket toolkit and shared resources for communities looking to do their own air quality monitoring.
