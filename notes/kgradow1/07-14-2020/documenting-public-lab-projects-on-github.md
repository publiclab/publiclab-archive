Hi all, my name is Katie.  I'm the Community Tech Fellow working on the bucket monitor project for Public Lab.  I'm circling back with some procedural questions on open hardware documentation!

As we move forward on the first draft of a project build, I am doing some background work on best practices for open hardware documentation.  I'd like to post plans for this project on Github, as well as OSHWA, but I'm not sure how best to affiliate them with Public Lab.   

For github specifically, is there a way to tag or link projects to Public Lab, or should I just post under my own account and reference in a link?   

Is it appropriate to cross-post documentation on github if there's no software component?

I'm not quite to the point of posting anything yet, just scoping out the territory. 

Thanks in advance!

Katie
