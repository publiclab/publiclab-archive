Air quality sampling is a tool that communities can use to establish scientific evidence. However,
testing can be expensive and may turn up nothing. Air samples can also be used to show improvements in air quality. This guide offers tips for simple observation, research on air emissions and air monitoring tools, and planning. Your project will be more likely to succeed if you do your homework before gathering air samples.

If you're considering setting up a sampling plan, start by inviting neighbors in the community to talk about their experiences and observations about pollution. Form a group. Read through [this whole guide first](https://communityactionworks.org/wp-content/uploads/SfA_AirGuide.pdf), to get an overview of the whole process. Learn what air testing can and can't do for you. Discuss your overall strategy and priorities:

## Step 1: What is the ultimate goal?

What's the ultimate goal? Creating pressure for ongoing monitoring? Trying to relocate a classroom
or change local business practice? Make distinctions between short-term and long-term goals.

## Step 2: How does air testing fit that goal?

Do you want to see if levels are harmful? Look for changes over time? Link pollution to a business or source?

## Step 3: Whose health are you highlighting?

Whose health are you highlighting: workers, children, pregnant women, elderly, families near a
facility? Where do they live, work, go to school?

\##Step 4: Who are the decision-makers you're trying to convince?

Who are the decision-makers you're trying to convince? What will convince them?

\##Step 6: Will there be opposition to doing testing?

Are there powerful people, companies, or agencies who might object? Is your team ready to face
those consequences?

\##Step 7: Is this realistic?

Does your group have the time, energy, skills, and finances for a sustained air monitoring campaign? Will they ask the right questions at the right time? What will they do if tests are inconclusive, or don't support the cause?

| Air testing CAN help you | Air testing will NOT |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Detect contaminants most likely responsible for health effects | Reverse health effects |
| Show what people are exposed to | Provide money for treating people |
| Show levels changing with time and wind direction | Stop the source of the pollution |

\##Step 8: Decide on a question

After discussing priorities, decide on a question you want to answer. This question will help guide
future decisions. Be as specific as possible. Will air monitoring help answer this question?
