Tedlar bags can be an affordable alternative to Summa canisters. They are used for grab sampling (a form of whole air sampling) to take a "snapshot" of an air sample at a specific point in time; they can also be attached to a pump system to take a weighted sample over time. Tedlar bags are used in the following ways:

| **BUCKETS** | **INFLATABLE BAGS** | **PUMPS** |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **How it works:** The bag sits inside a sealed bucket. A small vacuum sucks air out of the bucket, creating a pressure differential. When the bucket valve is opened the bag inflates, filling automatically with air. | **How it works:** An evacuated bag that comes with handles.  To take a sample, open the valve on the bag  and carefully pull the handles to inflate the bag by hand.  This is a proprietary system that is only available from certain suppliers. | **How it works:** The bag is connected to a pump which pulls air through the system and into the bag to take a sample.  Like Summa canisters, the pump surface needs to be inert, which adds a step in terms of cleaning and setting up the system. |
| **Advantages:** Affordable.  No direct contact with the vacuum; the sample is taken automatically when you open the valve | **Advantages:** Affordable; inflatable bags run about $40-60 apiece, vs. $100 for the bucket and $1000 for a pump system. | **Advantages:** Pump systems can be connected to flow controllers to take a sample over time.  Good for taking calibrated samples. |
| **Cost:** $100-200 | **Cost:** $40-60    | **Cost:** $1000 and up |

Once the sample is taken, the bag is removed and sent to a lab for analysis.

\*\* Benefits:\*\*

- Gives you a "snapshot" of what's in the air around you
- More affordable than Summa canisters
- Can be built with parts from the hardware store (bucket monitor)

**Limitations:**

- Whole air sample: does not measure particles or biological compounds
- Sulfur compounds may react with metal fixtures or fittings in the sampling bags
- GC-MS testing is more expensive than other types of lab analysis

**Shipping considerations:**

- Air samples degrade quickly in Tedlar bags (1-3 days). Depending on where you are taking your sample, you may need to use rush shipping to get it to the lab in time to analyze it
- Sample bags are sealed and may explode in depressurized cabins (airplanes)
