Many of the monitoring tools that people are working on through Public Lab are linked to large-scale industry or development projects, almost all of which go through a public permitting process. I'm interested in developing better ways for people to track and participate in advocacy around permit applications whether at the hyper-local level (knowing about and engaging with city ordinances) and at the state level (MEPA review for large-scale development projects). 

What resources are out there that people have used?
