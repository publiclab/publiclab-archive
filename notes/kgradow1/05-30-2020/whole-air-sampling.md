Whole air sampling is typically done with canisters or Tedlar bags to take a "snapshot" of an entire air sample and test for chemicals that may be present. Grab sampling is a form of whole air sampling. Whole air samplers test for gases and are often used to sample volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

##What is whole air sampling?

- Whole air samplers measure gas phase chemicals
- Whole air samplers typically test for 40-100 different chemicals
- Whole air samples are often used as a diagnostic tool to narrow down what you are looking for

##How is whole air sampling different from sorbent tube sampling?

##When would you need a whole air sample?

- Identifying an unknown smell: You smell something noxious and want to do a test
- Risk assessment and hazard mitigation: You're concerned there's something bad in the air
- Narrowing the scope: You're not sure what you're looking for and want to test for a wide range
- Ambient air monitoring: You want to take a baseline air sample for a given area
