I am looking at the EPA Methods for Toxic Organic Compounds (TO Methods) for ambient air quality monitoring.  The [compendium][1] looks like it hasn't been updated since 1999 and most of the direct links [on this page][2] are from 1984.  That seems really old!

Are these references still up to date?   If not, where should I look?
