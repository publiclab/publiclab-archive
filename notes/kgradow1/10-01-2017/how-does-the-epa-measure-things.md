I've spent a lot of the last day and half trying to catching up on PM monitoring techniques for the microscope project.  In this article - https://publiclab.org/wiki/silica-monitoring - there are a number of references to EPA monitoring techniques for different particles sizes.   Beyond writing up an explanation of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction  (which seems useful on its own), it might be useful to do a methodology review for how the EPA measures differently sized particles.

  
A brief overview of measurement techniques might be useful for providing context for what people will and won't be able to see.  SEM pictures are detailed and very beautiful, and I think they give people a misleading view of what you can see with at the 5-10 um level.  I've found that to be confusing when working with the [Open Flexure microscope](http://www.waterscope.org/3d-printing/)
