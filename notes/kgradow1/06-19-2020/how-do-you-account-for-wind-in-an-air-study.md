As part of the bucket monitor project, I am looking at what additional factors -- weather, wind, local  sources of VOCs -- need to be tracked and accounted for in order to validate an air sample.  
I'm specifically interested in wind since it's an important factor in identifying the source of an emission.

I read a study that used a handheld weather model to capture temp, wind direction, barometric pressure, and others, and other guides that propose using paper logs.  I'm curious as to what standard practice is, how wind data is typically captured and correlated with air samples.
