We did a version of this last year as childcare, but it might be good to just have a daily workshop that is a room full of tools and materials for prototyping.  Some stuff would need to be sourced locally  (we're not going to bring a stack of cardboard on a plane) but a lot of stuff can be crowd-sourced.   Are people interested?   If so, what should we bring?
