Unhealthy Homes: A panel discussion featuring Robert McConnell, Motley Rice / Central Falls Associate Municipal Housing Court Judge, Liz Colón and Devra Levy from Childhood Lead Action Project, and Kris Brown from United Way Rhode Island.

Twenty years ago, Rhode Island became the first state in the nation to sue paint manufacturers to remove lead paint from homes. Hear from the lawyers and activists who have worked tirelessly since the mid-1990's to reduce childhood lead exposure in Rhode Island.
