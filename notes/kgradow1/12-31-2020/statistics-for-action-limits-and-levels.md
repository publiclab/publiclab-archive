##Overview

Environmental advocates see many kinds of limits and levels. What are these limits? If a test result exceeds one of them, are there implications for health or legal liability? This resource has fact sheets for limits and levels you might read or hear about. Each tells you what the limit is, how it’s used, how it’s determined, and how it relates to health.  Most of the fact sheets also list a web site with more information. 

Many states have health-based standards that are more restrictive than the federal standards. The states may call those standards by different names. If you want to use the conservative standards, check both federal and state regulations, and choose the limit you prefer.  Many fact sheets refer to units like mg/kg, ppm, and µg/m3. For help understanding these units, see the fact sheets in the resource Common Units.

###Detection Limits and Quantitation Limits
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

[Original print version][3]

**What are they?**
Every measuring device has limits. If you put one penny on a digital bathroom scale, the scale still reads zero. If you keep adding pennies, you eventually see a number at 0.1 lb (one tenth of a pound). That means 0.1 lb is the detection limit for that scale. Anything less is not detected. Tests for air, water, and soil contamination methods also have detection limits, below which a contaminant can’t be detected. They also have quantitation limits, below which they can detect a contaminant, but the amount can’t be accurately measured (“quantified”)

![image description][4]

_Image: Pennies on a scale_

**How are they used?**
Detection and quantitation limits are called by different names on test results:

* instrument detection limit (IDL)

* method detection limit (MDL)

* practical quantitation limit (PQL)

* limit of quantification (LOQ)

* minimum quantitation limit (MQL)

When test results are below detection limits, you may see ND, meaning “Not Detected” or U (“Under the detection limit”) or an * or < symbol. In each case, there should be a note somewhere on the page showing the detection limit. Sometimes the number will appear in the results themselves, like “<5,” meaning “less than five."

![image description][5]

_Image: Sample chart showing detection limits.  Here, for each testing date the results appear next to a "Limit." But this isn't a legal limit, it's the detection limit. Notice how the detection limit changes each month as the lab tries to find a limit that will detect the contamination, but won't be far more sensitive than is needed._

**How are they determined?**
Detection limits are determined by the equipment and methods used for testing. A lab should
choose equipment and methods that will detect contamination well below health-based standards. If
50 µg/L might be hazardous, but the the detection limit is 100 µg/L, then a “not detected” won’t tell you whether or not you’re at risk. It’s better to set detection limits at 5 µg/L, one-tenth the level of concern. However, very sensitive tests are expensive, and not always necessary. If the screening level is 5,000 µg/kg, you don’t need a test that can find as little as 1 µg/kg. Also, a very sensitive instrument might not work for high levels of contamination – your bathroom scale wouldn’t work to weigh an elephant or a truck!

**How are they related to human health?**
Detection limits aren’t directly related to health or safety. If you have test results, it’s more important to compare levels to a health based standard, like a screening level or legal limit. Detection limits are only a problem if they’re set too high, and risky results are undetectable.<a name="reporting"></a>


###Reporting Limits
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

[Original print version][6]

![image description][7]

_Image: People at a table discussing reporting limits_

**What are they?**
In cases where testing has been mandated by a government agency, the agency may require contamination above a certain level to be reported, even if it is below the level of concern. 

**How are they used?**
Laboratories must use equipment and procedures that are capable of detecting
contamination as low as the reporting limit. Sometimes tests show contamination above a reporting limit, but below a health-based standard. In those cases, a community might want to test nearby, to
see if there is a contamination ‘hot spot’ they might have missed.

**How are they determined?**
The reporting limits may be set at a particular fraction of the level of concern. For example, if the legal limit for a contaminant is 20 µg/L, the agency might set the reporting limit at 2 µg/L, which is one-tenth the level of the limit. That way, they will know if contamination is anywhere close to the legal limit.

**How are they related to human health?** 
Contamination levels over the reporting limit aren’t a health concern, unless the levels also go over a health-based standard.<a name="background"></a>


###Background Levels
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

[Original print version][8]

**What are they?**  Background levels (usually measured in soil) are the levels of contaminants that you might normally expect to find in a place, but that can’t be attributed to a single polluting source. Some toxins may be in the soil because they are naturally occurring, like arsenic or uranium. Others may be due to widespread human use – for example, lead from car exhaust in the mid-20th century spread widely in soil and water. Background levels vary from place to place. 

For air and water, different terms may be used for the same idea. Scientists may say “ambient air quality” to mean a background level of outdoor air quality when comparing with contaminated indoor air. But this can be confusing, because there are also ambient air quality standards (see NAAQS) that have nothing to do with background levels.

**How are they used?** Comparing a test result to background levels helps show how unusual a test result is. If a test result is significantly above background levels, there might be a specific human cause for the contamination. Showing unusually high test results can help determine legal liability for cleanup costs or shutdowns.

**How are they determined?** Background levels are determined by testing over a very large area, like a whole county or state. The background level is often set at a value like the 90th percentile (meaning 90% of the samples were below that level, so it would be unusual to find a sample above
that level). Sometimes the background level is simply the average of all the samples.

**How are they related to human health?** Background levels and ambient air quality are determined by measurements, not by safety. A test result for a toxin that is close to the ‘normal’ background level might still be a health concern, if the background level is very high. On the other hand, if the background level is very low, a test result might be above background levels but might not be a health concern. For health risk insights, compare test results to health-based standards, not to background levels.

![image description][9]

_Image: This map reflects background levels of arsenic in Massachusetts
well water. A high arsenic level in a private well in Groton might not
be unusual, because it could be from the high background level. But
the same level in Plymouth would be unusual, so it might be easier
to prove it came from a specific business. In either place, you should
avoid drinking contaminated water._<a name="reference"></a>


###Reference Dose (RfD)
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

[Original print version][10]

**What are they?**
RfD is the amount of a substance, per unit of body
weight, that a person could consume every day for
their rest of their life with no increased likelihood
of negative health effects. RfDs are measured in mg/
kg/day – milligram of toxin per kilogram of body
weight per day. (Note: RfDs do not address cancer
risks; there is no ‘safe’ level for a cancer-causing
toxin. See Cancer Slope Factor for more.)

**How are they used?**
RfDs are not legally binding by themselves, but they
are the “building blocks” of almost all risk assessment. Health-based standards should be set so that
a person with typical daily exposure won’t get more
than the RfD of the contaminant. For example, a
toxicologist knows a typical (154-lb) person drinks
2 - 4 liters of water per day. They might set the MCL
for a toxin in drinking water so someone drinking
that water would not exceed the reference dose.

Another example: A risk assessor focused on risks
from contaminated soil might see if anyone’s exposure to that soil might lead to them absorbing more
than the RfD of a toxin. Risk assessors also look at
multiple paths of exposure: If someone is exposed
to a toxin through the soil, water, and air, do all of
those exposures add up to exceed the RfD?

A risk assessor might find that the level of contamination in a particular case is unlikely to be harmful
even if it exceeds a particular standard. If exposure
is less than typical (people rarely drink this water or
come into contact with this soil) then there is less
risk of exceeding the RfD.

**How are they determined?**
RfDs are based on tests of laboratory animals. Sometimes they are based on human health studies from accidental exposure. Scientists start with a level of the
toxin that has shown no observable negative effects
(NOEL/NOAEL), or the lowest level of the toxin
that has shown negative effects (LOEL/LOAEL) in
lab animals. They then make that number smaller by
safety factors:

![image description][11]

_Image: Safety factors_

In this way, an RfD may end up being 1,000 times
smaller than a NOAEL.

**How are they related to human health?**
RfDs are set based on health risks, and are intended
to be very conservative. They assume a lifetime
of daily exposure at the RfD, so exposure slightly
above the RfD for a short time is unlikely to increase
health risks. Again, RfDs are for non-cancer effects. See Cancer Slope Factor. <a name="cancerslope"></a>

###Cancer Slope Factor and Unit Risk Factor
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

[Original print version][13]

**What are they?**  A _cancer slope factor_ gives the percent increase
in the risk of getting cancer associated with a
dose of a toxin (in mg of toxin per kg of body
weight) every day for a lifetime.

A _unit risk factor_ is based on the slope factor,
but is specific to air (and sometimes water).
The inhalation unit risk factor answers, “How
many more cancer cases per million people
would I expect to see for every microgram of
this toxin per cubic meter of air?” For water,
it’s for every microgram of toxin per liter of
drinking water.

**How are they used?**
A risk assessor will apply cancer slope factors
and unit risks to test results to calculate how
many more cancer cases a population might
be likely to see if that population had a lifetime
of exposure to that amount of a toxin. Slope
factor is general, while unit risk is specific to
air or water.

**How are they determined?**
Cancer slope factors and unit risks are
usually based on tests on laboratory animals.
Sometimes (but rarely) they are based on
human health studies from accidental
exposure. Calculations for people assume a
70-kg adult, exposed to the toxin for 70 years
by breathing 20 m3
 of air (or drinking 2 L of
water) per day.

**How are they related to human health?**
There are no ‘safe’ levels for carcinogens,
because damage to a single cell can cause
cancer. However, lower levels of a carcinogen
will cause fewer additional cancer cases. If
studies show that a certain level of a carcinogen isn’t likely to cause one new cancer case
out of one million people, officials may decide
that it is ‘acceptable’, even if it is not technically risk-free.

![image description][14]

_Image: Chart showing cancer slope factor. Scientists look at data from experiments and find the relationship between the dose (how much toxin is consumed) and the
response (health effects). If they know what dose affects one in ten
lab animals, and what dose affects one in a hundred lab animals,
they can calculate the dose that would affect one in a million._

###Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) & MCL Goals (MCLGs)
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

[Original print version][16]

![image description][17]

_Image: Drinking water from a tap_

**What are they?**
The EPA publishes maximum
contaminant levels (MCLs)
for different toxins in drinking
water. MCLs are measured in
milligram (mg) or microgram
(µg) of contaminant per liter
(L) of water.

**How are they used?**
MCLs have legal weight. Public water systems
are required to keep contamination below
MCLs. If a business has contaminated private
drinking water wells above the MCLs, the
company may be liable for damages, health
care costs, and cleanup costs.

**How are they determined?**
MCL Goals (MCLGs) reflect ‘safe’ levels as
closely as toxicologists can determine: if you
drink this water every day for your entire life,
you will not be any more likely to experience
ill effects than if you didn’t drink that water.
See Reference Dose for more on the science of
how MCLs are set. For carcinogenic (cancer-causing) contaminants, there is no safe level,
and so the MCLG is zero.

Unfortunately, achieving a zero (or extremely
low) level is not always physically or politically possible. So MCLGs are ideal, but
not legally binding. Regulators then set the
MCL, which is legally binding, “as close to
the MCLG as feasible, using the best available treatment technology and taking cost
into consideration.” 

**How are they related to
human health?**
MCLs are are a legal guideline, but they aren’t a dividing
line between ‘safe’ and
‘unsafe’. The MCLGs offer
the best protection of health.
Some states, tribal groups,
and European countries have
more protective standards.

Remember that both MCLs and MCLGs are
set assuming a lifetime of exposure. If contamination is only slightly over the MCLG,
drinking one glass of it is unlikely to harm
you. MCLs are most protective of human
health in that they allow government agencies
to take action to reduce contamination.

###Groundwater Objectives (GWOs) and Preventive Action Limits (PALs)
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

[Original print version][20]

**What are they?**
GWOs are legal standards set by states for
underground water. PALs are based on GWOs,
and trigger action to prevent contamination
from exceeding the GWO. GWOs and PALs
may have different names in different states.

**How are they used?**
Groundwater objectives are legally binding. A
business found to be contaminating groundwater beyond a GWO can be shut down.
If contamination exceeds a PAL, a business
must take action to prevent further contamination, like reducing emissions or slowing
production. PALs don’t trigger a shutdown,
but they can serve as a serious warning that
something needs to change. 

![image description][21]

_Image: Groundwater objective and preventive action limits in Rhode Island_

**How are they determined?**
GWOs are set to be protective of people and
ecologies for a variety of uses. For example, in
Massachusetts there are 3 GWO categories,
each with its own objectives:

|||
|---|---|
|**GW-1:**. Strongest standards, for groundwater that could be used for drinking water|
|**GW-2:**. Meant to limit contamination from evaporating out of shallow groundwater and going into the air in a nearby building|
|**GW-3:**. Minimum standards that apply to all groundwater in the state|

Preventive Action Limits are based on the
groundwater objectives – often set at one half
or one tenth of the GWOs.

**How are they related to human health?**
GWOs are set to be protective of human and
ecological health. The set levels are based on
assumptions about typical behavior. People
with much more (or much less) contact with
groundwater should keep exposure in mind
when assessing a particular situation.<a name="squirts"></a>


###Screening Quick Reference Tables (SQuirRTs)
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

[Original print version][22]

**What are they?**
These tables contain a range of levels,
all relating to potential damage to
aquatic life (tiny animals living in
water) from different levels of contamination in surface water (rivers, ponds,
bays, etc.) and sediment.

**How are they used?**
Like other screening levels, they are not legally
binding. They are used as a quick comparison
to measure the severity of contamination, and
potential ecosystem effects.

**How are they determined?**
The levels are set by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). There
are levels for “No Observable Adverse Effects
Level (NOAEL)” all the way to “Severe Effects
Level (SEL)”. These levels are set based on lab
experiments and tests of actual contaminated
bodies of water. One of the most common
levels used is the “Threshold Effects Level
(TEL)” which is the lowest level of contamination thought to harm aquatic life. 

**How are they related to human health?**
SQuiRT levels are set based on ecological
health, not human health. However, if a
test result shows very high levels compared
to a severe SQuiRT level, be careful
around that body of water. You will want
to see results from additional tests before
swimming, drinking nearby well water, or
eating fish from the contaminated water.

<a name="RSSLs"></a>


###Residential and Industrial Soil Screening Levels (RSSLs and ISSLs)
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

[Original print version][25]

**What are they?**
Screening is a first pass at soil testing.
Investigators try to locate contamination at a
site, and to see how much there is. In EPA
language, this is “Phase II” or “site characterization.” Investigators compare test results
to EPA Region III Soil Screening Levels to
determine how concerned they should be
about the contamination. SSLs are measured
in milligram of the toxin per kilogram of soil
(mg/kg) which is the same as parts per million
(ppm). Smaller amounts are measured in
micrograms per kilogram (µg/kg), the same
as parts per billion (ppb).

**How are they used?**
Screening levels are widely used as a point of
reference for various contaminants. There are
different screening levels for residential and
industrial use. If contamination in a sample
exceeds a screening level, it is cause for
concern, but it does not automatically
mean that people are in danger or that
a cleanup is legally required. It usually
means there should be more testing
in that area, to get details about the
contamination, and about current and
planned uses for the site.

**How are they determined?**
SSLs are based on two factors: the relative
toxicity of the contaminant, and on “typical”
human exposure to soil. Residential levels
(RSSIs) are set lower than Industrial levels
(ISSLs), because people spend more time at
home than at work, and because the most
vulnerable populations (children and the
elderly) are not often exposed to industrial
settings. Workers in industrial settings can
also be required to wear protective clothing if
there is contamination.

**How are they related to human health?**
Screening levels are based on “typical”
exposures, but in reality, people have a wide
range of contact with soil. If test results are
above screening levels, a risk assessor should
study how people might come into contact
with that soil, and assess risk of exposure. 

![image description][26]

_Image: Screening level calculations for different types of use_<a name="NAAQS"></a>

**For more information:**
Visit [https://www.epa.gov][27]

###National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Criteria Air Pollutants (CAPs) and Air Quality Index (AQI)
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

[Original print version][28]

**What are they?**
NAAQS regulate six CAPs considered harmful
to public health and the environment:

* ground-level ozone (O3)

* particulate matter (PM)

* carbon monoxide (CO)

* sulfur dioxide (SO2)

* nitrogen dioxide (NO2)

* lead (Pb)

There are two types of
standards for each CAP.
Primary standards provide
public health protection. Secondary standards
protect community assets
beyond public health. AQI
is scale that gives a quick sense of a day’s air
quality based on five CAPs (all except lead). 

**How are they used?**
States measure air quality, particularly in
urban areas, and compare to NAAQS. Places
where air contamination exceeds one or
more standards are called “non-attainment”
areas. In those areas, states must have a plan
describing how they will try to improve air
quality.

AQI is a scale ranging from 0-500; a lower
AQI is safer. An AQI of 100 corresponds to the
primary standard for each CAP. As air quality
changes on a daily or even hourly basis, the
AQI can tell you how clean or polluted your
air is and associated health effects. If you hear
a warning on the radio about a hazardous air
quality forecast, it’s based on the AQI.

** How are they determined?** 
Primary NAAQS are intended to protect public
health, including protecting the health of sensitive populations like asthmatics, children, and
the elderly.Secondary standards
provide public welfare
protection, including
protection against
decreased visibility and
damage to animals,
crops, vegetation, and
buildings.

The AQI at a particular moment is based
on air sampling. It’s
based on how close each of five CAPs is to its
standard, with 100 representing the standard.
It’s weighted more heavily toward the most
hazardous pollutants.

**How are they related to human health?**
Primary NAAQS and AQI are meant to
protect human health. Small or temporary
exceedances might affect sensitive people.
High or long-term exceedances may harm
many people.

![image description][29]

_Image: Daily Peak AQI for PM2.5 and O3_<a name="RfC"></a>


###Reference Concentration (RfC) for Inhalation
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

[Original print version][30]

![image description][31]

_Image: People biking near a factory_

**What are they?**
RfC is a concentration of a toxin in the air
that is unlikely to cause non-cancer health
problems, even if a person breathes air with
that concentration for an entire lifetime. It is
usually measured in mg/m3
 or µg/m3.

**How are they used?**
RfCs are not legally binding, but they can be
used as a guide for assessing risk. RfCs are also
not as widely monitored and enforced as the
NAAQS.

**How are they determined?**
RfCs are usually based on tests on laboratory
animals. Sometimes they are based on human
health studies from accidental exposure.

**How are they related to human health?**
Air contamination below RfCs is unlikely to
cause health problems, even in the most sensitive people. As contamination goes higher
above the RfC, the more likely it is to cause
problems.

RfCs are only set for _non-cancer_ effects. If an
air toxin is a carcinogen, there is no ‘safe’ level.
See Cancer Slope Factor. 
<a name="OSHA"></a>

**For more information:**
Visit [https://www.epa.gov/iris][32]

Except for NAAQS, states regulate air quality
more directly than the EPA. California lists
their RfCs (calling them Reference Exposure
Levels, or RELs) at:
[oehha.ca.gov/air/allrels.html][33]

Use these, or your own state’s standards if the
EPA lists no RfC.

###Occupational Safety and Health Administration Permissible Exposure Limits (OSHA PELs) 
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

[Original print version][34]

**What are they?**
PELs are regulatory limits on the amount or
concentration of a substance in the air in a
workplace. There are also some PELs for skin
exposure to workplace contaminants. Most
PELs apply to industry in general, though
some are specific to shipyard employment and
the construction industry.

**How are they used?**
Most OSHA PELs apply to the average level
of air contamination over an 8-hour period
in a workplace. This is called an “8-hour time
weighted average (TWA).” There are also
short-term exposure limits based on 15-minute
periods, and ceiling limits that should never
be exceeded. If a business exceeds a PEL, they
can be fined. If they exceed PELs regularly,
they can be shut down. 

**How were they determined?**
The American Conference of Governmental
Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) regularly
publishes a set of guidelines called Threshold
Limit Values (TLVs®). In 1972, OSHA
adopted the TLVs as official PELs.
Even though the TLVs have continued to be
updated since then, only a few PELs have been
changed in that time. Most PELs have not.
Changes have been proposed in the past, but
have been blocked in the regulatory process.

**How are they related to human health?**
The TLV guidelines were theoretically related
to human health, but were not originally
intended to be hard limits determining safety.
PELs are widely criticized by environmental
scientists and regulators for being based on
outdated science. Many PELs would fail a
modern EPA risk assessment. PELs should
not be considered protective of human
health.

**For more information**. Visit [osha.gov/law-regs.html][35]
or check your state’s labor law enforcement
agency website.
