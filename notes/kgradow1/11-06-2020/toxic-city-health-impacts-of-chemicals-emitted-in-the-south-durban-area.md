Adapted from [SDCEA's Toxic City Booklet](https://sdcea.co.za/download/toxic-city-booklet/) and generously shared with permission.

SDCEA has compiled a list of companies in the south Durban area and the chemical emissions each of these companies are involved in. Accompanied with these chemicals, is a list of acute (short term) and chronic (long term) health impacts associated with each of the chemicals. The health effects listing was reviewed by Professor Rajen Naidoo of the Discipline of Occupational and Environmental Health, University of KwaZuluNatal. 

This book aims to educate and create public awareness around what chemicals are being put into our air, by these companies, and essentially hold them accountable for the multitude of health issues the residents of the south Durban basin face on a daily basis. _NOTE: In reposting this material, PL has sorted by industry type_
