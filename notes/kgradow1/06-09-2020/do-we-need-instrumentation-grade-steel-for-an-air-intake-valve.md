I am trying to source parts to do a build test for the [bucket monitor](https://publiclab.org/wiki/bucket-monitor).  

The original parts list calls for instrumentation-grade Swagelok parts:

Does anyone know if I can swap these out for Home Depot parts?  

It looks like I can get 3/8" compression couplings that are designed for air tubing for around $3 each, which would be a HUGE savings.

That said, I don't know if it would react differently or invalidate the air sample.
