I was looking through photos from Fractracker and had some questions!

Many of the photos have this characteristic shimmering air. What causes this?  This one, for instance, looks like clean-burning flame (i.e. no smoke) which suggests that whatever is being burned is being wholly converted with very little carbon or soot.  I realized I had no idea what I was looking at.    

  
- Heat haze (where you're seeing a refraction of light due to convection and temperature)
- Gas cloud (where you're seeing a refraction of light due to -- new molecules floating around?)
- Invisible smoke (where you're seeing -- refraction due to tiny particles? but that would just be haze)

I don't know much about how fire works. 

  
I guess a related question is:  Can you tell anything about a flare based on how dirty the smoke is?
