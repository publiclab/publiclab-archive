Texas Sea Grant and the Texas Coastal Watershed Program have just published a <a href="http://www.urban-nature.org/We-Table.htm">detailed fact sheet</a> on the "weTable".  The weTable is a powerful adaptation of some very simple technology to produce a highly interactive platform for stakeholder participation. The weTable was pioneered by Placematters and Placeways--we just gave it a very cool name. The pdf available on the referenced page appears to be the most detailed description of how to put a weTable together.

There is also a link to our CHARM page--the model that made the weTable sing. The model is developed on a CommunityViz/ARCGIS platform, and enables coastal citizens to play with fairly complex scenarios involving coastal hazards and resources CHARM stands for Community Health and Resource Managment.
