During the summer months I work as a barman , in our family Bar Restaurant , here in Greece.
The previous summer I came across a bottle of "Disaronno Originale" a brand of Amaretto (italian liquer) that had 
1. No safety valve (most alcoholic drinks in Greece have a valve)
2. A bit of a different taste from another Disaronno bottle I had.

The color was the same but I was sure it wasn't "Disaronno Originale".

As soon as I built my Vis-NearIR* spectrometer and calibrated 
it was the first sample I wanted to try.

and ...
SUCCESS!!!!
The two samples are quite different in the IR spectrum but not in the Visual spectrum

*Spectrometer configuration

Shoe box
20 Euro webcam (I removed the IR filter)
slit width ~ 1mm

I have placed the DVD piece parallel to the lens but detached (~10mm) so I can focus the camera without touching the DVD piece,


I want to analyze olive oil for my next project but that requires UV,
any ideas on how to get my webcam to pick up UV?

Any Ideas on where to get small square bottles?
 the round ones create "noise"
