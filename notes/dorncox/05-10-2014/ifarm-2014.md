###What I want to do

Cross posted Event to [FARMHACK.NET ](http://farmhack.net/wiki/ifarm-2014)

SATURDAY & SUNDAY May 17-18th

This weekend meetup will be to coordinate open source agricultural and remote sensing systems with a focus on integration of air, water and soil sensor networks and coordination of overlapping efforts between university, public labs, farm hack and other organizations. There is a cap on the group size so please please RSVP to dornawcox@yahoo.com if you are interested in attending. This event will build on and current ifarm tool and will likely result in several new tool listings and an [update to the existing wiki structure](http://farmhack.net/tools/ifarm-imaging-agricultural-research-and-management) to accommodate the growing aspects of the project and the diverse communities and technology coming together.  

###Questions and next steps

###Agenda

Saturday

10-12:00 Presentations by Public Labs water quality initiative, Apitronics, MiLand, FidoII(WIFI), color calibration cards and a demo of ubiquity router and on-farm commotion wireless mesh networking installation.

Friday Schedule
UAS focus - Meet at Kingman Farm with UAS systems completed or in progress.

some topics that may be of interest
- setting up the multicamera NDVI rig in fixed wing aircraft
-triggering it without chdk and with the pixhawk
-flight tuning and PIDs
-field flight kit and checklist review
-learning some of the new features in Mission Planner
- setting up mission points and the trigger to avoid "throw away" shots from bank turns etc.
- refining shorter approaches and landing techniques in challenging conditions
-discussing fail-safe setup
-discussing different transmitter setups and programming
- prop, engine, ESC, and battery usage efficiency

Safety -
We will agree on some basic safety checklists and protocols to be observed throughout the time dedicated to UAS's.
