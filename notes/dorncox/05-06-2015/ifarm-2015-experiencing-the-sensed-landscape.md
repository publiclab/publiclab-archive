**Description**
Cross posted Event to [FARMHACK.NET](farmhack.net)

**Friday- Sunday  May 15-17th**
This weekend meetup will be to coordinate open source agricultural and remote sensing systems with a focus on integration of FarmOS and the Open Pipe Kit with  air, water and soil sensor networks and coordination of overlapping efforts between university, public labs, farm hack and other organizations. This year’s theme is “experiencing the sensed landscape” which will guide our conversations about how we can “experience” environmental data beyond the smartphone and computer screen.   There is a cap on the group size so please please RSVP to dornawcox@gmail.com  if you are interested in attending. This event will build on and past ifarms to accommodate the growing aspects of the project and the diverse communities and technology coming together.
