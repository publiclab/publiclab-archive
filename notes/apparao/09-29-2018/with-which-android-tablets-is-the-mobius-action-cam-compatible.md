I have bought Mobius ActionCam. I am trying to connect the camera to Android devices. I tried with Samsung J Max, the camera gets recognized but when attempted to access the camera through the App, the camera is recognized and on clicking the Live Video button, the picture appears, subsequently when the camera is moved, the image does not get updated. On a complete reload of the App only a black screen appears. With Samsung Tab A, on clicking any of the options in the menu only a black screen. Would you please let me know which Android tablet is compatible with the App & the Camera and the required RAM size?
