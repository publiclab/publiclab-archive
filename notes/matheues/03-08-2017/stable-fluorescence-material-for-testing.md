I want to do or know a **Stable fluorescence material** for testing.
I am trying to test a fluorescence reader. During the test the optical property(fluorescence) of the samples/test material is degrading. I am unable to take multiple test on same sample. For different sample I cant assume that both have same optical property (accept that it will be similar). The reader is sensitive in pW. I want some idea on samples that can be used for testing.
