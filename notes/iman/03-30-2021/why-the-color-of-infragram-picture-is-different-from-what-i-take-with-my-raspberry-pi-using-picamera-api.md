When I connect to my Camera using Raspberry pi local network and Infragram, the picture is:

  
![image description](/i/43103.jpg "Infragram.jpg")  

  
But when I take a picture with my Raspberry Pi using Picamera API with the same settings as Infragram, the picture is:

  
![image description](/i/43104.jpg "2021-03-30T120944-si-ndvi-zone_R.jpg") 

  
Why is it different while settings are the same? Is Infragram's preview picture, a processed picture? If yes, how can I process the latter picture to get the former's colours?
