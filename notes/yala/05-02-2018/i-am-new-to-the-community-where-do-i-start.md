Best Public Lab community,

I have been loosely following their activities within the last decade and just sign up to this community space.

Coming from a site-reliability engineering perspective with [ecobytes.net](http://ecobytes.net) and [allmende.io](http://allmende.io), we have since produced software artefacts with [wiki.libre.sh](http://wiki.libre.sh), [transformap.co](http://transformap.co) and further commons-producing groups.

Now we want to get involved with hardware hacking, learning more about [mesh networking](https://hack.allmende.io/s/anarchist-meshbook) wherever it may be suitable.

Can you help, do you know of anything fancy that one could deploy in a small size town of ~ 15.000 inhabitants, distributed across several villages in different valleys. In this area mostly ecological agriculture is practiced and its vibrating dynamics conglomerate in community-supported agriculture, two food coops, a transition town house, several farms and an in-depth network of informal relations and mouth to mouth exchanges. People often despise technology for what it stands for, and retract from investing too much attention too it. Therefore the machinery of attention economy wins and people spend a lot of time with using proprietary messaging systems, and, more autonomously, e-mail.

How could one imagine a scenario where little environmental monitoring and presentation in a virtual learning environment about the region could help increase the public recognition for alternative reproductive systems?

Thanks in advance if you've seen some site like https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q564827 before, and may it only be hypothetically \\o/

Jon
