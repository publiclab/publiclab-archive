##Design + Air Quality Sensing + Bicycles##

###Workshop###

The emphasis of the workshop will be to create designs in which bicycles are reimagined as tools to measure air quality, using inexpensive air sensors and arduino prototyping platforms. The focus will be more on the creation of ideas and a discussion around what’s possible. 

###When###

<strong>May 7 – 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm (or later)</strong>

###Project Background###

Actual Air is a project which looks at various ways which everyday tools and resources can be re-imagined and reappropriatted as instruments to measure air quality within spaces of everyday experience.

The underlying ambition of the workshop is to create a space which enables the design and creation of tools which are personally meaningful and relevant expressions of how individuals could imagine designs in relationship with their bikes. The first step of the process would include a discussion of ideas, possibilities, and implementation strategies. The proceeding steps would facilitate and enable the implementation of individual ideas and designs.
