I asked this [question ](https://publiclab.org/questions/belkinsa/07-18-2018/are-there-any-diy-equipment-that-measure-dissolved-oxygen-levels-in-water)and now I want to know if any research notes were posted about D.O. monitoring here. Sorry if this a question that shouldn't be posted but my searching skills are bad.
