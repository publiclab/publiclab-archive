**Note: This needs more info that I don't have! I happy for help! Thanks!**

**Dissolved Oxygen Testing and Citizen Science**

Dissolved oxygen (DO) can be tested with sensors and/or colormeteric methods. The first senor method was developed by Leland Clark, who created the [Clark electrode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_electrode). There is also the [Winlker Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winkler_test_for_dissolved_oxygen), which is a colormeteic method that anyone above the age of 14 can do.  

**Sensors are Pricey**

**Examples of Citizen Science for Dissolved Oxygen**

**Questions**

Have you experienced either positive or negative results using any of the methods or devices listed above?

Have you had results from DO sensors other than those listed above? If so, can you share your experience?

In addition to testing for DO, what other water quality testing have you utilized, such as turbidity, conductivity, pH, etc.? Can you share your experience with these?
