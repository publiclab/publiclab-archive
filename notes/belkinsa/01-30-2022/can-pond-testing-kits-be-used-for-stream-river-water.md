I looked at various stream/river water test kits and the biggest con is you get 30 tests per kit. If you are testing often, that can get costly fast! Hence my question, can a pond testing kit, such as the [API Masters Kit](https://apifishcare.com/product/pond-master-test-kit "https://apifishcare.com/product/pond-master-test-kit"), be used for non-pond water?
