We are participating in Outreachy winter program 2021\. Outreachy internships are 3 months long. Interns are paid an internship stipend of $6,000 USD. Interns work with experienced mentors from open source communities.

We've done Outreachy for 4 years now. Outreachy explains that:-

> Anyone who faces under-representation, systemic bias, or
> discrimination in the technology industry of their country is invited
> to apply.
