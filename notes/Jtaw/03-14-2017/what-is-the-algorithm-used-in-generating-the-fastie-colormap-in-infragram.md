\###What I want to do or know

I want to know how the NDVI values were converted into its equivalent fastie color.
I know that the NDVI values were adjusted in a way that it will be represented into a grey image. from that grey image how does infragram convert it to an image with a fastie colormap.

\###Background story

I am currrently doing a project that is using a raspberry pi to generate an NDVI image, what I am planning to do is every time I am able to obtain the necessary images I'll be able to instantly produce the NDVI image in fastie colormap without using the Infragram and other software. I just want it to be a part of my code. If ever my project will become succesful, I'll surely give an acknowledgement/credit to you guys and to the creator of fastie colorspace.
