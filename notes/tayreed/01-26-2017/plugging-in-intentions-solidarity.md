Hey friends,

I'm brand new here, and apologize if this is in the wrong place. I'm currently working on an independent study course on Environmental Applications in Spatial Statistics & Analysis, and hoping to plug in meaningfully and do some real-world work through Public Lab's community and initiatives.

I'm looking for two (or more) areas where work involving GIS/Spatial Stats/Landscape Metrics might be helpful. If any of you might have any thoughts or ideas, I'm very interested. I'm located in Northern Lower Michigan, and have interests in, well, anything ecology, environmental law and policy, etc related (as well as plenty more that's not). Real glad to be here- it's good for the heart & mind to see what you folks are doing.

Best,

Taylor
