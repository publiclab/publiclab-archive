Mapping trips in Louisiana and California, an incredible amount of work done on the infrared/visible camera rig and beautiful community-generated maps printed directly from MapKnitter... that's what the Public Lab community has in store this week!

1) Infrared camera documentation is coming together. There have been a bunch of great notes (some highlighted below) posted in the last week, but an overview and guide can be found [here](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/dual-camera-kit-guide). 

2) A new place page has been posted for the [Mildmay community in London](http://publiclaboratory.org/place/mildmay), UK. This project is being led by students from University College London ExCiteS that have been working with the Mildmay Community Centre on joint Public Lab and ExCiteS projects.

3) You can now [print directly from MapKnitter.org](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/gonzoearth/5-10-2012/print-maps-plots-archive-and-mapknitter)! This was announced awhile back, but buried under a ton of other things that were also happening, so we want to make sure everyone is aware.

4) Hey San Francisco/Bay area mappers! Tomorrow, Saturday 5/12, people will be gathering at Delores Park at 1pm. Come and join to learn about balloon mapping while making a map of the park. Contact Stewart@publiclaboratory.org for more information.

5) And Southeast Louisiana! On Monday, May 14th, people will be mapping at Big Branch. For more information or to join the mapping trip, contact scott@healthgulf.org.

6) Public Lab will be participating in an [environmental justice encuentro](http://ejencuentro.org/) in Houston next week. From Tuesday-Thursday, we'll be with Global Community Monitor, Air Alliance Houston and the Pacific Institute who will be doing community mapping and air monitoring at Galena Park and Thursday-Friday we will be at the encuentro, where I (Shannon) will be talking about the (air column monitor)[http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/air-column-monitor] that is in-development. 

7) Finally, highlights of research notes from this past week:
