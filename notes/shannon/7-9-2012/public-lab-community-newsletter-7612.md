A couple nice opportunities await you in this weeks Public Lab community newsletter-- be one of the first subscribers to the Grassroots Mapping Forum, check out the UMass open hardware workshop next week or think about submitting an article proposal to Citizen Science Quarterly:

1. Get your subscription to the Grassroots Mapping Forum! We're beginning a subscription drive for the Grassroots Mapping Forum, to ship at the end of the month.  It can now be purchased in the [Breadpig Store](http://breadpig.com/products/grassroots-mapping-forum-subscription-1).  All Kickstarter balloon kit level backers (and above) will receive the first issue for free. 

2. New tagging feature in MapKnitter. If you are logged in, you can now [add tags to any MapKnitter map](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/7-2-2012/tagging-and-user-accounts-mapknitter) to allow grouping/search of, for instance, [pollution maps](https://mapknitter.org/tag/pollution). Please help out by jumping in and tagging maps that are already in MapKnitter (check out this [example](https://mapknitter.org/map/view/bayou-st--denis), but you must be logged in to tag).

3. Tyvek and bamboo kite workshop a success! Although research notes are still being compiled, check out [images from the workshop](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/elainechoi89/7-5-2012/tyvekbamboo-kite-workshop-pfizer-building-brooklyn-ny-629-302012), held this past weekend in Brooklyn.

4. Citizen Science Quarterly accepting submissions. Take a look at the [call for submissions to issue three](http://citizensciencequarterly.com/writers/) -- the theme is education and the proposal is due August 15. Send an email to the list if you're interested in finding collaborators for writing an article on this topic, it would be great to see Public Lab research discussed.

5. UMass Open Hardware Workshop. Don Blair posted to the list earlier today to let people know about the [UMass workshop](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/publiclaboratory/uKzJOqaWVRE) coming up on July 14th. That's a week from now, so if you're interested act fast! 

6. Upcoming workshops with the Environmental Justice League of RI. Next week Public Lab begins a series of workshops with the [Environmental Justice League of Rhode Island](http://ejlri.wordpress.com/). The workshops will focus on balloon mapping sites of environmental health concern in Providence, and testing the thermal flashlights in their winterization program.

7. And last, but not least, research notes from the past week:
