This week in the Public Lab community newsletter, read updates on mobile and desktop spectrometer progress, hear from the NYC chapter on plans for 2013 and read the incredible range of research notes that have been posted over the last week. Enjoy!

Mobile spectrometer updates. Check out the [latest updates](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/braddudenhoffer/2-23-2013/mobile-spectrometer-design-update) from Brad Dudenhoffer on the mobile spectrometer design. 

Evolving a DIY spectrometer. Public Lab organizer, Chris Fastie, created a [video](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/2-19-2013/ebert) that details how plans evolved and changed as he created an open, DIY spectrometer. Congrats to Chris who also received a barnstar for his crafty video work. 

Public Lab NYC 2013 kick-off. If you missed the Public Lab NYC meeting this past Monday, [read updates](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/liz/2-21-2013/nyc-2013-kickoff-meeting-0) on what the group has been up to and hear a bit about planning in the upcoming year.

Toxics Action Center conference. Public Lab partner, Toxics Action Center, will be hosting "Local Environmental Action 2013" on Sunday, March 3rd. If you're interested in attending, find more information [here](http://www.maenvironmentalaction.org/). 

Welcoming a new EPA EJ Director. Public Lab is happy to extend congratulation to Dr. Matthew Tejada who will be moving on from Air Alliance Houston to run the EPA Office of Environmental Justice. Read more about Matthew's exemplary work in Houston [here](http://blogs.edf.org/texascleanairmatters/2013/02/20/houston-air-quality-advocate-poised-to-share-talents-in-new-national-role/). 

Presidential Innovation Fellowships. This [fellowship announcement](http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows) passed through our email this week. Some folks might be interested as it aims to, "pair top innovators from the private sector, non-profits and academia with top innovators in government... to develop solutions that can save lives, save taxpayer money, and fuel job creation."
