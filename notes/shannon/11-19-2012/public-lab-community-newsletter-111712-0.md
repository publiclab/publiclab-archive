Hope that everyone is having a great start to their weekend! This week in the Public Lab community newsletter, we have enough exciting updates to keep you away from that late Saturday afternoon nap... an environmental summit in Vermont, using aerial images to dispute development of a mass grave site, grant money for all those great ideas you have floating around in your head and lots of interesting research notes (including DIY cotton candy making). Enjoy!

1. Wrap-up of the barn raising. Cindy Regalado, from University College London, ExCiteS [wrote a great wrap-up])http://uclexcites.wordpress.com/2012/11/10/strengthening-community-plots-barn-raising-2012/) of the weekend that she spent in Cocodrie with thirty other Public Lab community members. Notes have also just been posted from other sessions: [oil response toolkit brainstorm](http://www.publiclaboratory.org/notes/mathew/11-15-2012/barnraising-oil-response-toolkit-brainstorm), [ethics of practice](http://www.publiclaboratory.org/notes/mathew/11-15-2012/barnraising-ethics-practice) and [talking Gowanus Canal](http://www.publiclaboratory.org/notes/mathew/11-15-2012/barnraising-liz-barry-talks-gowanus-canal). 

2. Vermont Environmental Summit. If you're in Vermont, VPIRG and Toxics Action Center are co-hosting this [one day summit](http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/5980/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=9648). Public Lab organizer, Chris Fastie will be leading a session called Mapping Tools to Help Community Organizing, but there are also a number of other great sessions to get you thinking about the state of environmentalism in Vermont. 

3. Bay Area Automated Mapping Association article. Stewart Long recently completed an article for BAAMA on Public Lab mapping tools and how they've been put to use in the bay area. [Article starts on page 16, Volume 6, Issue 2](http://baama.org/journal). 

4. Mapping neighborhoods in Kampala, Uganda. Check out this [note](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/csik/11-10-2012/mapping-neighborhoods-kampala-uganda) on mapping the Women's Craft Market and the TLC Youth Center in Kampala, Uganda.

5. The Dead May Have Been Awoken. Eymund Diegel reports back on how he and other grassroots mappers are [using aerial images](http://www.publiclaboratory.org/notes/eymund-diegel/11-13-2012/grassroots-image-helps-influence-local-land-use-debate) to contribute to conversations about development plans for an old mass grave in the Gowanus area.  

6. WyoLum Innovation Grant. Just announced, there are [six small grants](http://wyolum.com/wyolum-innovation-grant-2012/) for open source projects that range from $250-$1000. The deadline is December 14, 2012. This sounds like a great opportunity for funding collaborative projects happening in the Public Lab community as well as elsewhere!

7. Bayou Bienvenue community workshop. Tuesday, November 27 from 7-9 at the All Souls Episcopal Church in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans (5500 St. Claude Ave.). Hear from coastal experts and community leaders who are working to restore the wetlands in the Lower 9. Prior to the workshop, Public Lab folks in New Orleans are planning on doing a mapping of the bayou on Saturday, November 24. If you're interested and able to join, please email eustatic@gmail.com.

8. Last but not least, Research Notes:
