In the Public Lab community newsletter this week, check out an invite for a hackfest next weekend, read about air monitoring projects underway and learn a much easier way to install CHDK on your Canon. Enjoy!

1. Science and the City hackfest. On the 9th and 10th of February, [Science and the City](http://www.scienceandthecity.info/), a hackfest dedicated to citizen science for cities, will take place at NYU's ITP. There's a bunch of [interesting projects](http://www.scienceandthecity.info/projects) that have been proposed, but if you have a project to pitch, they're still accepting.

2. New Zealand vs. the U.S. It's not actually a competition, but Mathew Lippincott, the resident Public Lab kiting expert, wrote-up a couple of notes on the different techniques used in [New Zealand](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/mathew/2-1-2013/how-pauls-fishing-kites-flys-wind) and the [United States](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/mathew/2-1-2013/american-kite-fishing-low-tech-kite-balloon-hybrid) to tack kites against the wind.

3. Cypress Hills air quality monitoring program update. [Assembly of modified Air Quality Eggs](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/liz/1-31-2013/aqe-sd-assembly) with SD cards for use at the Cypress Hills Community School in Brooklyn began this past week.   

4. One Sky global event. Work is underway on an idea for a global event of balloon flying to collect atmospheric data. Research notes are being collated under the tag "[air-column-monitor](http://publiclaboratory.org/search/node/air-column-monitor)".

5. Simple CHDK installation. Remember how frustrating it was to put a CHDK script on your Canon camera when you were late and running out the door to go on a mapping trip? Although I may be the only one to have had such an experience, finally there's a [super simple program for installing CHDK](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/mathew/1-31-2013/programs-simple-chdk-and-stereo-datamaker-installation)!

6. Citizen science and the BP oil disaster. Louisiana State University hosted a conference on citizen science this past week. Scott Eustis [wrote up a note](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/eustatic/2-1-2013/daniel-nguyen-mqvn-discusses-best-practices-citizen-science-during-bp-oil-di) from a session he attended where Daniel Nguyen of Mary Queen of Vietnam spoke about fishermen from the Village d'Est working with Tulane researchers on a monitoring project. 

7. Last but not least, research notes:

As always, if anything was missed, please post a research note, email the Google Group or message shannon@publiclaboratory.org for inclusion in the newsletter next week. Have a great weekend, Shannon
