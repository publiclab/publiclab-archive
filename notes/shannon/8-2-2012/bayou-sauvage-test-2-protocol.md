We did the first test in June and semi-followed this protocol: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/shannon/6-22-2012/h2s-test-experimental-protocol-bayou-savage-la. 

Some of the revisions for it can be found in the follow-up note that Scott wrote: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/eustatic/6-23-2012/h2s-strip-placement-bayou-sauvage-nwr-orleans-parish-la.

Tomorrow, we're doing test #2, a couple of changes based on results and methods from last time include:

1. All canisters at one level 
2. 8 poles- 2 canisters per pole about 1 foot above ground (2 canisters to check that results are the same per pole as they shouldn't differ)
3. Each pole will also have a Draeger tube attached to it for calibration purposes (http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/sara/5-21-2012/excellent-geoscience-fieldtest-photostrip-h2s-detection)
4. labeling with permanent marker and white out rather than stickers which fell off some last time
5. Since we have a shortage of black negative canisters, some of the canisters are wrapped in black duct tape (email me if you want to donate canisters! Shannon@publiclaboratory.org)

These will be picked up Monday next week.
