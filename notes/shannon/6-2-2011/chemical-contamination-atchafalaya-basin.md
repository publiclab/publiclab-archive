A good blog post from the Louisiana Bucket Brigade about chemical contamination in the Atchafalaya Basin- this is the basin that food waters from the Mississippi are being funneled into upon opening the Morganza Spillway. <br>
<br>PLOTS volunteers Anthony Merino and Mariko Toyoji collected images of the Bonne Carre Spillway in early May which can be seen here: <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/bonnet-carre-spillway">http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/bonnet-carre-spillway</a><br>
