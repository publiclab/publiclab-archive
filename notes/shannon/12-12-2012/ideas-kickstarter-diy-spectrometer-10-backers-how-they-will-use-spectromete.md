We asked each of the Kickstarter backer levels what they plan to do once they receive their spectrometer. Mini-foldable spectrometers that can attach to your smartphone are shipping this week and here's some of the ideas that people listed from the $10 backer tier. 

Responses from other backer levels:
[$35 backer level](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/shannon/12-16-2012/ideas-35-kickstarter-backers-how-they-will-use-spectrometer)
[$100 backer level](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/shannon/12-15-2012/ideas-100-kickstarter-backers-how-they-will-use-spectrometer)
[$200 and $400 backer levels](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/shannon/12-13-2012/ideas-400-and-200-kickstarter-backers-how-they-will-use-spectrometer)

###Related to light###
* Measure light sources
* Investigate indoor lights spectrum
* Light analysis
* Film lighting
* compare light bulbs, ...
* Measuring output of LED arrays for a NASA-funded project for growing plants inside extraplanetary habitats. Someday we'll do some detailed spectroscopy but this gets us going!
* Colour experiments.
* Experiment with home theatre displays (projectors, plasmas & lcd tvs)
* Figure out what's in the ceiling lights in the lab!
* Analyze led light sources for reef aquarium
* Testing fluorescent materials in our lab
* Getting reliable RGB readings from withered surfaces

###Related to Water and Soil###
* Check for calcium in water from fountain
* Start with the tap water in my house
* Checking the purity of water, measuring other things for fun and possibly science.
* Will probably look at my tap water before and after filtration just to see if there is a difference.
* Aquaponics, Led Light, water quality, food quality.
* Hopefully I'll start sampling some groundwater around my area.
* Test the possibility for deriving water quality parameters or Chlorophyll content with forward transfer models
* Testing water 
* Test water in the Charles River, test local tap water.
* Check water quality, have fun
* Test the water in Greenpoint!
* Check and see what's in the rain drops
* Water and soil samples
* Check out rock pieces and dirt

###Related to Food and Drink###
* Catalog what's in my drinks
* I want to test spectrometry on food - liquid and solid. Most importantly - to measure the content of nutrient on particular pieces of fruit and vegetable (if feasible).
* Look at coffee + beer?
* Analyzing food
* Find out what I'm drinking
* Home brewer.
* Analyze home brew beer
* Check what I'm eating and other fun things
* Check what I drink? Processed bottled drinks.
* Home brewing
* Mainly using it on edible items I guess + wines
* Initial plan is to use it to analyze coffee
* Classify all kinds of neat liquids I can find!
* Test food, water, compare...
* Testing whiskey
* Study fruit we produce.
* Measure organic compounds in home-brewed beer
* Maple syrup and whatever else I can think of.

###Related to Household items###
* Examine various household items
* Experiments with common liquids and materials
* Test leather
* Analyze stuff I run across. If it works really well, might check for contaminants on supplies at work.
* Analyze household light sources, household materials
* Mainly interested in testing supposedly chemical-free or natural products.
* Look at water, and various things around the flat and neighbourhood
* Seeing what's in my aquarium water.

###Related to biology and chemistry### 
* Cell culture / immunofluoro
* Analyze bodily fluids
* Local air quality
* I plan to get involved based on whatever your site recommends! My interest is in biology, so, probably I'll be analyzing living tissue.
* I will be checking blood in specimen.
* Examine my feces and sperm
* Set up spectroscopy in an IEC reactor to detect gas mixture!
* See if they're contaminating our precious bodily fluids.
* Try it out in my lab (i'm an analytical wood chemist), around town, at home, etc. 
* Spectrometerizing all the liquids I can find!
* Gas analysis

###Related to Astronomy and Atmosphere###
* Astronomy demos
* Hobby astronomy, and fun education with the children
* Measure the Dark Side of the Moon
* We are building the space elevator. Our Kickstarter campaign is launching a tethered balloon experiment to 7KM high. We will host the spectrometer at that altitude to identify atmospheric conditions.
* Teach astronomy!

###Related to Chemicals (general)###
* Chemical discovery
* I will be using it for quick chemicals analysis in my Lab.
* Chemistry!
* Checking oil samples
* Testing local environment and know hydrocarbons with an aim of tracing them through the environment.
* Composition of some plastics for extrusion.

###Related to Education###
* My son is a super scientist. He will be using it to replace the DIY one he made recently.
* Use it to explore the world around me and as a teaching tool with my kids.
* Public high school for science - looking for alternative spectrophotometers
* Informal teaching
* I plan to experiment with it in the high school science class I teach.
* I'm an educator, and I hope to evaluate this project's classroom suitability.
* Home schooling physics
* Exploring my world with my kids.
* Use it to show my young children about spectroscopy.
* Science!
* Hope to use it for public engagement events.
* I love teaching kids about science, so Ill figure out some way to use it.
* Science training for my home-schooled grandson
* Showing it to my nerd friends
* Show it off at MyScience.com
* I'm a biologist & lab automation engineer. I enjoy science advocacy in general and plan tip share the spec with kids & science educators.
* Use in high school science lab as a teacher.
* Whatever I can! First I'm going to show it off to my father, the head of a high school science department and fellow chemist.
* Play around, teach, test chemometric methods
* Teach chemistry to my grandchildren
* Share with students... to help them understand spectroscopy and see science all around

###Miscellaneous### 
* Backyard experiments
* Make it available in Africa
* Just for fun
* Awesome experiments!
