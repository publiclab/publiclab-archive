Friggatriskaidekaphobia is a wonderfully complicated word that simply means fear of Friday the 13th... but I doubt anyone will be fearful of today in the Public Lab community when it brings news of some great accomplishments over the last week! In this issue, read about creating a large-scale map project, work that is being done in the Alaskan Tundra, and a number of research notes dealing with hydrogen sulfide photostrip testing and aerial mapping.

1. Inside a 100+ image map project. Stewart Long wrote up a note on a large scale project that he completed ([check out the incredible map!](http://publiclaboratory.org/map/big-branch-lacombe-louisiana/2012-05-14)), stitching together over [100 images from Big Branch National Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/gonzoearth/7-11-2012/notes-large-map-project) using Adobe Photoshop and tools from GDAL.org to stitch and publish. 

2. UMass Open Hardware Workshop tomorrow. Just a reminder that this workshop is happening tomorrow, July 14th. It seems that there are people [organizing ride shares to the workshop](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/publiclaboratory/uKzJOqaWVRE) and there might be a seat or two left if you're interested!

3. Occupy Bay Area Exhibit.  Now open through October at the San Francisco [Yerba Buena Center for the Arts](http://www.ybca.org/occupy-bay-area). The show includes aerial maps of the Occupy protests created by Public Lab community members. 

4. Hydrogen Sulfide photostrip testing in California. Folks in the Bay area of California are getting ready for testing out the photostrip detection method for H2S. If you have thoughts on the [process that has been outlined](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/deepwinter/7-11-2012/draft-experimental-plan-h2s-study-collapsed-salt-marsh), please leave comments.

5. Finding Helium. [Help by adding your local supplier](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/helium)! So far we've only heard from people in Portland, San Fran and New Orleans, but there are hundreds of other locations that are being aerial mapped and it would be great to have your help in growing a list of suppliers.

6. Kite Mapping Tundra Plots. Public Lab community member, Chris Fastie, shares notes from his fascinating work [imaging tree plantings in the Alaskan Tundra](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/7-9-2012/kite-mapping-tundra-plots). 

7. Article on Gowanus Canal aerial mapping. Eymund Diegel and others from the Gowanus area in Brooklyn, contributed to an article called [Birds Eye View from a Giant Red Balloon](http://www.gowanusyourfaceoff.com/2012/07/12/birds-eye-view-from-a-giant-red-balloon/) in the publication, Gowanus Your Face Off.
