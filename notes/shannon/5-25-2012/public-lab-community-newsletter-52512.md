Greetings! This week the Public Lab community newsletter has listings for a couple great events tomorrow (read quick and then go!) as well as a call for you to become a contributing passenger pigeon (caught your interest huh?) and a recap of cover crop infrared farm mapping. In addition, new research notes from this past week include a great range of topics-- from a video on hydrogen balloons (and yes an explosion) to a recap of May Day mapping and photostrip tests for hydrogen sulfide at the Frasassi Caves in Italy.

1) This past Wednesday, there was a cover crop infrared farm mapping in Lee, New Hampshire with [FarmHack](http://www.youngfarmers.org/practical/farm-hack/) and folks from UMass Amhearst. Images are coming soon, but in the meantime, read more and access links on the [FarmHack forum](http://www.farmhack.net/forums/say-hi) or catch up on [covercrop remote sensing imaging](http://www.farmhack.net/tools/covercrop-remote-sensing-imaging). 

2) Gowanus Canal mapping tomorrow! Before the [Clean & Green](http://gowanuscanalconservancy.org/ee/) event tomorrow, Gena Wirth and Eymund Diegel will be meeting around 9am at the salt lot to map. If you are interested in joining, please email geneva.wirth@gmail.com. Word on the street is that there also might be a BBQ and talk about aerial mapping work at the Gowanus around 1:30 which all are invited to attend. All events are weather permitting.

3) The iLAB fellowship is kicking off in NYC and Boston. This fellowship is bringing together first hand environmental data collection with embodied research practices. Notes will be cross-posted on [http://publiclaboratory.org](http://publiclaboratory.org) and [http://higher-e-d.tumblr.com/](http://higher-e-d.tumblr.com/).

4) Blogs and Media. Mathew Lippincott and Adam Griffith posted a new blog on the [PBS IdeaLab](http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2012/05/public-labs-keys-to-developing-low-cost-science-tools140.html) site about keys to developing low-cost science tools. From the [MarthaHenson blog](http://marthasadie.wordpress.com/2012/05/21/public-lab-mapping-diy-activism-civic-science/), get a recap of the Public Lab presentation this year at SXSW where Jen Hudon organized a panel that included Gregory Foster, Mathew Lippincott and me. 

5) "Passenger Pigeon" out-the-plane-window mapping now has it's own wiki page, [contributions and edits are welcome](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/passenger-pigeon)! 

6) There is a new "plots-nyc" mailing list for NYC events and happenings. Join the list here: [https://groups.google.com/group/plots-nyc](https://groups.google.com/group/plots-nyc).  

7) A last minute reminder about the thermal flashlight workshop tomorrow at AS220 in Providence. Sign up to participate here: [http://labs.as220.org/courses/FAB114](http://labs.as220.org/courses/FAB114)
