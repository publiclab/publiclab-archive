We hope that everyone who took time out of their week to eat a turkey/turducken/tofurkey had a relaxing day off. Since the Public Lab staff is currently on a mini break, this newsletter will be short and sweet. Enjoy!

Looking for a present for the DIY enthusiast in your life? A reminder that you can go to the [aerial mapping tool page](http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/balloon-mapping) and create your own gift ready kit, but you can also [order a kit with all necessary pieces](http://shop.breadpig.com/collections/publiclaboratory/products/balloon-mapping-kit) from Public Lab!

Bayou Bienvenue mapping tomorrow (11/24). New Orleans is still experiencing weather in the mid-70s, so why not come out and join others from the region as they map Bayou Bienvenue from canoes and kayaks? If you're interested in participating, please email Scott Eustis as eustatic@gmail.com.

Vermont Environmental Summit. Hear from Public Lab organizer, Chris Fastie, who joined others in Vermont this past weekend at a [summit](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/11-19-2012/vermont-environmental-summit) co-hosted by VPIRG and Toxics Action Center. 

Tidmarsh Farm mapping. Last weekend, 25 people braved the cold and gathered in Manomet, MA to kite map Tidmarsh Farms. Check out the [post](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/11-18-2012/tidmarsh-farms-mapping-meetup-success) on the mapping!

Back next week with the usual full newsletter, have a great weekend! Shannon
