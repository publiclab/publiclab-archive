We asked each of the Kickstarter backer levels what they plan to do once they receive their spectrometer. Backers at the $400 level are receiving both the mini-foldable spectrometer and the desktop spectrometer next week (as well as the countertop and mobile spectrometers in February). Backers at the $200 level are receiving the educational six-pack of desktop spectrometers. Here's some of the ideas that people listed from the two backer tier.

Responses from other backer levels:

###Related to light###
* The elematary school will be using it as part of the light and shadow learning modules in grade 3/4.

###Related to Water and Soil###
* analyze soil organic matter and mineralogy, plant nutrients
* Water and plant extract samples
* Soil sampling in archaeology
* There are two environmental groups in Puerto Rico I work with & support which can use the spectrometers to monitor water quality pursuant to the care & restoration of coral reefs: [Grupo VIDAS](https://www.facebook.com/groups/139894882692230/ ) &  [Coral Reef Investigation & Conservation Alliance](https://www.facebook.com/groups/388546164493969/)
* Geotechnical applications 

###Related to Food and Drink###
* Test coffee with it!
* What's in our food?
* Foodstuff testing
* Analyze food spectra

###Related to Household items###
* Printing (Ink analysis, Paper analysis, Brightener detection)
* Ink development
* Analysing construction material samples

###Related to biology and chemistry###
* Mineral identification
* See how well it works in plant stress research
* Vegetation condition. Chlorophyll and nitrogen content of leaves. Leaf structural composition.
* Examine feces
* Identify plastics for recycling through 3D printer

###Related to Chemicals (general)###
* Due to time constraints will be playing with an eye toward contaminants and sediments
* Testing at various oil and gas sites
* Industrial Chemical Analysis

###Related to Education###
* Teach the uses of spectrometry
* Teach the younger people in my family what science can do and why it is important.
* I plan to use the gear in my (public) science talks and workshops at educational conferences and my astronomy club.
* We plan to test them, verify its functioning and then donate it to an educational institute's laboratory.
* Use it for demonstrations/teaching tool
* Incorporate them into teaching & learning
* Doing inquiry with middle/high school students.
* One for the husband, one for the kids and four for the school in Oakland, CA

###Miscellaneous###
* Geeking out :)
* Photography
* Sending it to Zimbabwe....
