Happy 2013 everyone! We're excited for what this next year holds... look forward to a NYC kickoff coming next month, watch a detailed tutorial on putting together the mini-foldable spectrometer and come visit us at the brand new New Orleans office. Enjoy!

1. Getting started with the mobile spectrometer. Public Lab organizer, Chris Fastie, posted a richly detailed [note and video tutorial](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/1-4-2013/foldup-spectrometer-iphone) about his first experience assembling the mobile spectrometer. If you have the mobile version, or even if not, its well worth a view.
 
2. PBS MediaShift IdeaLab blogs. Two posts from Public Lab were posted to the PBS IdeaLab in the last couple of weeks. From Stewart Long, [Balloon Mapping from the Ground Up: Public Lab's field techniques](http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2013/01/balloon-mapping-from-the-ground-up-public-labs-field-techniques355.html), and from Liz Barry, [EcoHack Highlights: Sewage, Pedal Power and Cotton Candy](http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2012/12/ecohack-highlights-sewage-pedal-power-cotton-candy353.html).

3. Popular Mechanics features DIY Spectrometer. This past week, Popular Mechanics featured the Public Lab DIY spectrometer as one of [nine new disaster-relief inventions](http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/gonzo/9-disaster-relief-inventions?click=pp&src=spr_TWITTER&spr_id=1457_5974725#slide-3). 

4. New Public Lab office in New Orleans. This past week, the New Orleans branch of Public Lab moved into a long awaited work space in Central City. If you're ever in town, stop by at 4035 Washington. 

5. New York City chapter 2013 kick-off. For those in NYC, there is a TBD February meeting to kickoff local goals for the year and get coordinated with one another. See the PLOTS-NYC list for a forthcoming email about scheduling. 

6. Winter map update. Pay Coyle recently posted an [updated Winter map](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/gonzoearth/1-4-2013/looking-california-neighborhood-fall-and-winter-map-layers) of the Arroyo Mocho neighborhood in Livermore, CA. You can use the map viewer to  go fullscreen and look at the different maps together.
