Recommendations from Alex Kolker (Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium):

- Need to do a lit. review to identify if there are other substances that react with silver halide and could provide a false/positive
- Run through a series of reactions- things with low pH or other salts
- Send around to others to test in environments where there isn't H2S present
- Testing in a glove box at Tulane over the course of a couple months
- Can also test in Cocodrie at LUMCON facility in wetlands where H2S is naturally occuring (need to do this in hot months)
