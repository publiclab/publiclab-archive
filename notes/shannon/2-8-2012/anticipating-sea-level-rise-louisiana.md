Louisiana officials establish formula for anticipating sea-level rise: <a href="http://www.nola.com/environment/index.ssf/2012/02/louisiana_officials_establish.html">http://www.nola.com/environment/index.ssf/2012/02/louisiana_officials_establish.html</a><br>
<br>&quot;State <a href="http://topics.nola.com/tag/coastal-restoration/index.html">coastal restoration</a> and <a href="http://topics.nola.com/tag/levees/index.html">levee </a>projects should be designed to anticipate an average 3.3 feet increase in sea level over the next 100 years, according to a new <a href="http://coastal.louisiana.gov/">Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority</a>
 report. But the project designs must also consider whether changing 
circumstances, including a reduction in the speed in which coastal land 
is sinking or a possible catastrophic increase in atmospheric 
temperatures, could produce sea levels rises of only 1.6 feet or as high
 as 4.9 feet by 2112.&quot;<br>
