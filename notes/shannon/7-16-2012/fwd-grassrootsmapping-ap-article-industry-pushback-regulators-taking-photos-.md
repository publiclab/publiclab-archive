Mountaintop Removal Aerial Surveillance: Coal Operations Have Been<br>
Watched For Past 4 Years<br>
<br>
<br>
AP  |  By ROGER ALFORD Posted: 07/13/2012 1:38 pm<br>
<br>
FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Government inspectors have been keeping a close<br>
eye on coal operators through aerial surveillance in central<br>
Appalachia, a region that&#39;s been the center of debate over so-called<br>
mountaintop removal mining.<br>
<br>
The Kentucky Division of Mine Reclamation and Enforcement has spent<br>
more than $477,000 over the past four years for helicopter flights<br>
over coal mining operations, according to documents obtained by The<br>
Associated Press.<br>
<br>
A review by the AP found that the agency has been spending on average<br>
nearly $2,000 on each citation issued to mining companies for<br>
violations spotted from the air through an initiative started by the<br>
federal government&#39;s Office of Surface Mining.<br>
<br>
The flyovers came as a surprise to mining industry leaders, including<br>
Kentucky Coal Association President Bill Bissett, who not only<br>
complained about their &quot;covert&quot; nature but also questioned their<br>
effectiveness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is it not better,&quot; he asked, &quot;to have a regulator on the ground<br>
rather than 1,000 feet in the air?&quot;<br>
<br>
The agency defended the practice of flying inspectors over surface<br>
mines in a helicopter equipped with video cameras.<br>
<br>
&quot;We feel the helicopter&#39;s value as an enforcement tool is a necessary<br>
component of our overall enforcement program and we would suffer<br>
greatly if we did not use it,&quot; said spokesman Dick Brown.<br>
<br>
News of the government flyovers was also a revelation to Haven King, a<br>
political leader in coal-rich Perry County and an outspoken critic of<br>
what he sees as regulatory overreach.<br>
<br>
&quot;That amazes me,&quot; King said. &quot;There is a war against coal in<br>
Appalachia. They&#39;re going to shut coal mining down, and they&#39;re doing<br>
it through policy, not law.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kentucky Department of Aviation documents released to the AP under the<br>
open records law show that mine inspectors, state police, even<br>
wildlife officers routinely use the state&#39;s fleet of eight helicopters<br>
and four planes to look for errant coal operators, scout for<br>
clandestine marijuana, even watch for hunters and fishermen skirting<br>
regulations.<br>
<br>
Flight logs show hundreds of such missions over the past four years.<br>
<br>
News of Kentucky&#39;s use of aerial surveillance could fuel a growing<br>
public outcry about government agencies &quot;spying&quot; on an unsuspecting<br>
populous.<br>
<br>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been under fire in recent<br>
weeks for flying over Midwestern ranches looking for improper disposal<br>
of cow manure.<br>
<br>
Like the ranchers who object to that program, coal industry<br>
representatives said they have nothing to hide. But Bissett, whose<br>
organization represents most of the state&#39;s largest mining companies,<br>
said he was unaware of the flyovers.<br>
<br>
Tea party activist David Adams charged that the state is wasting money<br>
on the flyovers &quot;to spy on Kentuckians just trying to make a living.<br>
What&#39;s next? Ticketing highway drivers by satellite?&quot;<br>
<br>
Jim Waters, head of the government watchdog group Bluegrass Institute<br>
for Public Policy, said he doesn&#39;t believe the advantages of flyovers<br>
are worth the cost, especially during a time of economic recession<br>
when the state is cutting a wide array of government services.<br>
<br>
&quot;What does the taxpayer get out of that investment?&quot; Waters asked. &quot;If<br>
we cannot show how this benefits us as a commonwealth, then I think it<br>
is wasteful spending. We&#39;ve got coal miners losing their jobs, yet<br>
we&#39;re spending all of this money to further regulate the mining<br>
industry.&quot;<br>
<br>
Last year, the Division of Mine Reclamation and Enforcement wrote<br>
1,248 citations that resulted in nearly $10 million in fines. That<br>
averages to about $8,000 in penalties per citation written, though it<br>
wasn&#39;t clear how many of the 244 citations from flyovers resulted in<br>
fines.<br>
<br>
&quot;The helicopter was never meant to pay for its use by generating<br>
penalties from the violations that are written from its use,&quot; Brown<br>
said. &quot;That line of reasoning quickly gets into the overall<br>
enforcement program paying for itself by generating penalties — a<br>
bounty system.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brown said the Office of Surface Mining provided the money for the<br>
Division of Mine Reclamation and Enforcement to purchase the<br>
helicopter that his agency routinely uses. But the agency reimburses<br>
the Department of Aviation for operation expenses.<br>
<br>
&quot;They review our program on a continual basis and seem to be happy<br>
with our use of the helicopter,&quot; Brown said.<br>
<br>
U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, has filed legislation to<br>
impose some restrictions on aircrafts used to &quot;gather evidence or<br>
other information pertaining to criminal conduct&quot; without a search<br>
warrant. That legislation deals specifically with unmanned drones, not<br>
conventional planes and helicopters. But Paul said the government&#39;s<br>
use of even conventional aircrafts in flyovers is concerning for him.<br>
<br>
&quot;We just want a little bit of privacy,&quot; Paul said. &quot;You have to have<br>
that, because the alternative of having no restraint and no warrants<br>
to look at what people are doing is basically a police state.&quot;<br>
<br>
In Kentucky, government agencies aren&#39;t always looking for the most<br>
heinous crimes from the air. Mark Marraccini, a spokesman for the<br>
Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, said his officers<br>
use aircraft to search for people poaching deer, turkeys — even frogs.<br>
<br>
&quot;It&#39;s been an accepted and standard practice now for decades,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Paul questioned the wisdom of spending tax dollars to monitor frog ponds.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do we not have more important things to do? Do we not have rapists<br>
and murderers to keep off the streets, instead of looking for people<br>
gigging frogs? I mean that&#39;s ridiculous,&quot; he said. &quot;But the thing is,<br>
if it&#39;s a crime, then go to the judge and get a warrant.&quot;<br>
<br>
Flight logs from the department show wildlife officials used planes to<br>
search private land to try to find people illegally luring turkeys and<br>
waterfowl to shoot. They also use the planes to count ducks and geese.<br>
That agency spent more than $300,000 for flight time on the state<br>
aircraft over the past four years.<br>
<br>
The American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concern about<br>
flyovers to gather information on people without their knowledge,<br>
saying the nation needs to avoid becoming a &quot;surveillance society&quot; in<br>
which &quot;our every move is monitored, tracked, recorded, and scrutinized<br>
by the authorities.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;From our standpoint, there definitely needs to be clear restrictions<br>
on the use of aerial surveillance,&quot; said Bill Sharp, an attorney for<br>
the ACLU in Louisville.<br>
<br>
Brown, the spokesman for the Division of Mine Reclamation and<br>
Enforcement, said the agency has been doing aerial surveillance of<br>
mine sites via helicopter since 1988. He said the flights &quot;are a<br>
useful tool for identifying violations that may not be readily<br>
apparent on the ground.&quot;<br>
<br>
State police Capt. David Jude said planes are a key part of his<br>
agency&#39;s investigations, particularly in finding marijuana crops that<br>
would be nearly impossible to spot from the ground.<br>
<br>
The state police reimbursed the Department of Aviation $393,000 over<br>
the past four years for use of the state aircrafts. Last year alone,<br>
state police, with assistance from other law enforcement agencies,<br>
confiscated nearly $800 million worth of marijuana, most of it spotted<br>
from the air from state aircraft and Kentucky National Guard<br>
helicopters.<br>
