Although we just wrapped up our large yearly get together, there is still lots going on in the Public Lab community this week and next. EcoHackIII in NYC, an upcoming Public Lab get together in Boston, a new website and a recap of the barn raising, all in this weeks newsletter. Enjoy!

1. A new Public Lab website on the way. We're looking for a group of [Alpha testers](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/publiclaboratory/hpFBD3V2RvI) to be the first to dig in and try out the features of the the new publiclaboratory.org. If you are interested in being part of this group, [sign up here](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/plots2-alpha). 

2. EcoHack3 is underway! If you're in NYC today, stop by [EcoHack](http://www.ecohacknyc.org/) in Brooklyn where other technology/science/environment minded individuals will be getting together for a day of hacking. 

3. Boston Tidmarsh Farm meetup. On November 17th, people in the Boston area will be [getting together at Tidmarsh Farm](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/hudonnoodles/10-25-2012/boston-plots-meet-tidmarsh-farm). This is a great chance to learn, test your skills and meet other Public Lab members. 

4. Raspberry Pi in the Sky. This tool, being developed by Pioneer Valley Open Science's (PVOS) Craig Versek and PVOS member/Public Lab organizer Don Blair, was recently featured on the [MAKE blog](http://blog.makezine.com/2012/11/08/raspberry-pi-in-the-sky/), check it out!

5. MapMill adapted for Sandy response. In [this video](http://www.fema.gov/medialibrary/media_records/10369) FEMA gives a shout out to the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team who adapted MapMill.org for use with Sandy related imagery. 

6. Bring Your Own Data. Next week, Public Lab will be at the [Bring Your Own Data](http://www.hhs.gov/digitalstrategy/blog/2012/10/bring-your-own-data.html) forum in DC, if you're attending, please make sure to say hi!

7. Barn Raising 2012. This past Monday we wrapped up the [2012 barn raising](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/barnraising) in Cocodrie, Louisiana. There were three packed days of flying, canoeing (yes with kites), night fishing and discussions about developing the Public Lab community. A great time was had by all and we're already looking forward to the 2013 barn raising in... Cocodrie! Yes, the facility was a great fit and the general feeling was that we have a gem of a spot to host larger community get togethers. Look for a Save the Date coming soon. In the meantime, check out some of the [pictures from the barn raising](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/barnraising2012/), a [map](http://publiclaboratory.org/map/lumcon-cocodrie-louisiana/2012-11-04) that was compiled by barn raising attendees of LUMCON and keep an eye out for a number of smaller local barn raisings to be held throughout 2013. 

8. Barnstars are coming. The Public Lab community is made up of a diverse, supportive network of people that seem to always be willing to lend a hand. One of the topics that we discussed at the barn raising was using barnstars to recognize fellow Public Lab community members. Liz Barry will be sending an email soon on the topic, but in the meantime, [check out the planning page](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/barnstars). 

9. Over My Dead Body. Grassroots mappers in Brooklyn took to the sky this past July to look at the first military cemetery in the United States. A suggestion for your Saturday morning... take a minute to read the [note](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/eymund-diegel/11-9-2012/raising-dead-grassroots-mappers-help-look-america-s-first-veterans-cem) that organizer, Eymund Diegel wrote about the mapping trip.
