Here is a previous note on map annotation: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/5-15-2012/annotated-maps-roundup

**Timeline**
Minimum features (v01)...
  Open until it is locked
  Logbook as text form
  Images displayed as embed
  Catagories/colors

(v02)...
  MapKnitter comments to archive
  MapKnitter/logbook prompts w/ checklist (discuss during organizing session)
  Make MapKnitter maps presentation ready (archive)
  Polygons
  Legens/catagory filter

(v03)...
  Images
  Videos

"I want" statements from a brainstorming session at WinterCamp (phrased by Tom Levine) that included Tom Levine, Liz Barry, Scott Eustis, Dan Beavers, Shannon Dosemagen, Adam Griffith, Eric Kugler, Becki Chall, Mathew Lippincott and Jeff Warren.

**High Importance**

AS...
I WANT... historical versions of the whole map screen
SO THAT... I can compose historical maps and study changes over time

AS... Scott (GRN)
I WANT... to be able to draw polygons on top of a map
SO THAT... I can draw clouds around plumes, dead trees, etc.

AS...
I WANT... to turn a specified map on MapKnitter into a pretty map easily
SO THAT... I can easily create quick presentation maps

AS...
I WANT... to be able to draw points on top of the map
SO THAT... I can leave specific "ground truthed" data/information

AS...
I WANT... to be able to attach any file/audio/video/link/text to any annotation (points, polygons, etc)
SO THAT... I can add notes, video, data, etc to any annotation

AS... Mathew (workshop coordinator)
I WANT... the image-taking process to include note-taking
SO THAT... notes don't get lost

AS... a mapper
I WANT... to find clear directions about the map-making process
SO THAT... I know what to do and don't get tired

**Medium Importance**

AS... a community member
I WANT... to see maps about my neighbors
SO THAT... I start a conversation

AS... a person who has never mapped before
I WANT... everything to happen in one webpage
SO THAT... I don't have to think as much about tedious things

AS... someone with a smartphone
I WANT... to make points on a map by doing something with my smartphone (photo,text, etc) taking longitude and latitude from the phone
SO THAT... I can easily add stuff to the map

AS... someone without Internet access
I WANT... the whole mapping process to work with minimal Internet access (proper logbook)
SO THAT... I can make maps

AS... Shannon
I WANT... a clear difference between the editing and viewing interface
SO THAT... I don't accidentally edit anything when I don't want to

AS... a creator of maps
I WANT... o be able to dump stuff all over my map
SO THAT... I don't have to think in the field when I'm capturing stories

AS... a consumer of maps
I WANT... curated maps (like the archive)
SO THAT... they're not full of junk
