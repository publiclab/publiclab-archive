This week in the Public Lab community newsletter, check out the visually beautiful work being done on low cost infrared imaging, find out about the upcoming Google Summer of Code projects and view new maps in the archive. Enjoy!

1. Google Summer of Code. We're excited to welcome three students who will be working with Public Lab mentors through Google Summer of Code. Projects will begin this month and go through the end of the summer. Check out the projects they will be working on [here](http://publiclab.org/notes/gonzoearth/05-29-2013/announcing-3-accepted-google-summer-of-code-public-lab-projects). You can also join in on the conversation as the summer progresses by joining the [Public Lab GSoC mailing list](http://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc). 

2. Infragram update. Thanks to the 1000+ people who have helped Public Lab raise $48,000 so far via Kickstarter! On Friday we announced a new reward level-- the [Flight Kit](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/infragram-the-infrared-photography-project/posts/502353), which includes an Infragram Point & Shoot plus a balloon mapping kit to lift it up to 1000 feet in the air. 

3. Mapping project updates. Michele Tobias submitted a note on [mapping a farm](http://publiclab.org/notes/MicheleTobias/06-04-2013/farm-mapping-at-cloverleaf-farmstand-davis-ca) in California, cwhite posted an update on mapping [Riverside Cemetery](http://publiclab.org/notes/cwhite/06-03-2013/riverside-cemetery) in Asheville, NC and New York City Public Labbers [led a workshop](http://publiclab.org/notes/liz/06-03-2013/world-science-festival-with-cusp) with NYU CUSP.
