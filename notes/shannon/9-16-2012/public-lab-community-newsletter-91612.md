A quick Sunday morning update from the Public Lab community for everyone! Event announcements for Vermont, New York, California and Louisiana, new maps in the archive and introductions to new sites and projects. 

1. Barn Raising open invite. We sent out a "formal" invite to the Public Lab barn raising in November. If you missed the email, find information [here](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/shannon/9-13-2012/2012-public-lab-barn-raising-invitation). 

2. LEAFFEST is next weekend! For those of you in Vermont (or who want to travel there), please let Chris Fastie know ASAP if you plan on attending by registering on the [Google Form](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/9-5-2012/l-e-f-f-e-s-t).

3. Grassroots Mapping Forum on Breadpig. If you didn't get the most current issue of the Grassroots Mapping Forum, it is now [available for sale on Breadpig](http://breadpig.com/products/grassroots-mapping-forum-issue-2). 

4. Wrap-up of the UMass Amherst open science hardware workshop. Don Blair sent an [email](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/publiclaboratory/t8WdfSwDG7U) earlier this week with a wrap-up, photos and information about the newly formed Pioneer Valley Open Science organization (congrats!). 

5. 150 maps in the archive! I was planning on posting the links for new maps in this email, but then realized that there are twenty-six new ones, so I suggest taking a browse through the [Public Lab archive](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/gonzoearth/9-12-2012/150-maps-public-lab-archive-1) instead. Great to see maps from new places in Canada, the United States, Scotland, the Netherlands, Colombia, Slovenia, Greece, Australia and Spain.

6. Kickstarter Update. Check out the [assembly pictures](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/9-12-2012/assembly-pics-prototype-countertop-spectrometer) of a prototype "counter" spectrometer posted this past week. 

5. Balloon mapping workshop in Los Angeles. Stewart Long will be leading a [workshop](http://machineproject.com/archive/classwork/2012/09/23/public-labs-map-making-workshop/) on September 23rd at Machine Project. 

6. New sites and projects. Two new place pages have been started for groups that are developing chapters of Public Lab, a big welcome to [Vermont](http://publiclaboratory.org/place/vermont) and [Skane, Sweden](http://publiclaboratory.org/place/skane-sweden)! Public Lab is also helping Groundwork New Orleans with a project in the [Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/groundwork-nola/9-13-2012/green-slice-lower-9th-ward), mapping a corridor called the Green Slice. 

7. Upcoming events in New York City. A couple of workshops will be taking place, one about [dance and ecology](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/liz/9-13-2012/above-so-below-higher-ed-workshop) on September 23rd and a workshop on the [basics of balloon photography and map stitching](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/liz/9-11-2012/art-environment-action) at Parsons the New School for Design on September 28 and 29. Both are free to attend, but you need to register (information on the pages).


8. New Orleans Water Challenge. If you are in New Orleans, check out the call for applications for the [2012 Water Challenge](http://ideavillage.org/what_we_do/strategic_consulting/strategic_challenges/water_challenge) (figuring out innovative solutions for how we live with water) from The Idea Village and the Greater New Orleans Foundation.

9. Public Lab media. A PBS MediaShift Idea Lab [blog post on spectrometry](http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2012/09/public-lab-uses-kickstarter-to-bring-diy-spectrometry-to-the-masses254.html?utm_campaign=MediaShift&utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=FanPage_MediaShift) and a great [case study on the origins of the Public Lab project](http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/case-study-grassroots-mapping) from Kickstarter were published this past week. 

10. Public Lab fall cleaning. Server cleaning that is. Here's an [update](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/9-10-2012/new-servers-long-term-plots-data-archive) on the new server racks for long-term Public Lab data archiving.
