For H2S test in Bayou Savage, Louisiana 6.23.12
Developed by Sara and Shannon

* Prep of canisters- cut strips in a dark room- 1 inch in length, putting circular dot on one side of the strip- put strip into film negative canister

* Put a dot on the top of the canister

* aerial map of the site, take photos of the canisters as we put them out- use Rhus to map onto the balloon map

* Need to look up Rhus software to see if it needs to go on phone. Can also make crude map detailing the three rings

* For the canisters- how to have airflow and keep the strips dark- drill holes through tubes and then duct tape when sample is complete

* To test whether light is making a difference or not- top off, one hole, four holes- test this on the site

* Rings- 10 feet deep- darkening in ones that are closest- which way H2S is primarily traveling- need to check wind direction- need some in a ring that will be outliers- where there won't be H2S

* Try a couple of different heights- do this in a line- close to the point to midway to far away

* Need to be able to mark a map in relation to where we leave the strips- mark by hand or via photoshop and hand drill, string/ties to twist tie them to reeds or other ground markers or stick them in the ground and see if they hold

* Bring a computer out with photoshop to take aerial images- number all of the samples

* Leave them overnight- 2days or so

* Seal up holes for each of the sample somehow- collect in the same order that they were put out
