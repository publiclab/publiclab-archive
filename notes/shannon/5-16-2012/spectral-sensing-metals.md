In conversation with Lee Portnoff today, he mentioned two potential ways to sense for metal halides (interested in this because of copper/iron issues in Houston) with the air column monitor:

1. xray fluorescence (XRF)- take an xray of the source (on particulate or medium) and get a spectrum of the results.

2. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)- analytical method, collect on a filter and then dissolve
