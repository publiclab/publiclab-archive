Hope that everyone had a great finish to March and is looking forward to April! In the Public Lab community newsletter this week, check out the new Grassroots Mapping Forum, hear updates on tools in development and new spectrometer projects and learn about events in your area. Enjoy!

Hot off the Press. Public Lab just launched the third regular subscription issue of the Grassroots Mapping Forum, our community research journal/archive/zine/map, where we share ideas, techniques and stories from the community. This issue focuses on community organizing and includes pieces from individuals who spend a great deal of time thinking about how to get people active in science. Please help support Public Lab by [purchasing a subscription](http://store.publiclaboratory.org/products/grassroots-mapping-forum-subscription) to the forum or buying individual issues. 

Thermal Fishing Bob. If you haven't seen the notes, Public Labbers have been working on a new direction for the thermal flashlight-- the thermal fishing bob. Check out the [project notes](http://publiclaboratory.org/category/fishing-bob) and comment if you're interested in getting involved. 

Reminder: Spectral Challenge. Please continue to help spread the word about the [Spectral Challenge](http://spectralchallenge.org/) as we progress towards the end of Stage 1 on June 1st.

Vermont kite training. Join Toxics Action Center and Public Lab in Montpelier, VT this upcoming Saturday, April 6th for a [kite training](https://secure3.convio.net/engage/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=7836) and mapping session. 

Boston area meet-up. Also next Saturday, join others in the Boston area for a [meet-up at Pavilion Beach](http://publiclaboratory.org/es/wiki/north-shore-mass-mapping-meetup-pavilion-beach-ipswich-april-6-2013) in Ipswich for skill sharing and... a potluck!
