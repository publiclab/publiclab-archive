The AREN team is offering a great opportunity for teachers who are interested in learning about how to use a Terra-Rover to collect data on surface temperature.

  
[If you fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-91rOq9QfVUgjOrD-baWazy1RcBAPPKk_-uN5fMCh6ZoV9g/viewform) (limited spots available) by **April 1**, you can get a Terra-Rover to use with your students and receive training on how to use this tool. In particular, this is a great tool for studying the Urban Heat Island Effect. 

  
Training will happen during the evenings **May 17th-19th**.
