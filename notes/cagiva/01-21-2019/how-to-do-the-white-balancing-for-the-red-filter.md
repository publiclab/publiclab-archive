I received the [DIY filter pack][1] and installed the red (rosco #19) filter into a [Canon PowerShot A3000IS][2] CCD camera.  However, I'm not able to obtain the [pastel blue][3] result after doing the white-balancing calibration with the red card that came with the kit. Does anyone have any suggestion?
