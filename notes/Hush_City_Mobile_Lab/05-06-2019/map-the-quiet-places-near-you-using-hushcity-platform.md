With Hush City
app, you are an active part of a soundscape and citizen science research
project to map and evaluate everyday quiet areas.

Our cities are becoming noisier by the hour. Only in Europe, over 125
million people are affected by noise pollution from traffic every year, and
apparently, quietness is becoming a luxury available only to a few of us.****By using this free mobile app, you will contribute to making
quietness available to all those who appreciate it.****

Hush City app
will help you to identify, access and evaluate "everyday quiet areas" in
your neighborhoods. You can find places such as small, quiet spots where you
can go to escape the city's chaos, relax, read a book, play with your kids, and
have a pleasant conversation. Chill out!
