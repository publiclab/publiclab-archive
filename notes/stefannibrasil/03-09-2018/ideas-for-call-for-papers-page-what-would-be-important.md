Hi everybody!

@milaaraujo and I have been using Public Lab and we were thinking about adding a page for people to post Call for papers, so researchers can share relevant conferences, journals, etc., to submit their work.

We know you already have a page for events ([https://publiclab.org/events](https://publiclab.org/events)). But we believe the Call for Papers page could have a more academic focus. Here is some information I think would be important:

- Conference name and URL

- Date

- Description

- Local

- Deadline

And it would also be interesting to have a comment section on the page, so people could discuss their publications... That sort of things! What do you think about it? We'd love to hear more about your suggestions!
