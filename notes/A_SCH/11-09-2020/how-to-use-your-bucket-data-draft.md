Bobby Peek describes the importance of having reliable information during early campaigning efforts

---------

**Use your bucket data to build campaigns**

Having data that you can control is vital when trying to create change. Whether information about pollutants is being withheld, inaccurate, or just not there, you need proof that there is an issue in order to demand action. Without this proof, campaigns can be discredited or pushed aside for making unwarranted claims. Having access to data also helps mobilize communities, by informing people about a shared impact to organize around.

Rico Euripidou explains the importance of bucket monitors as grab samples.

---------

Bucket monitors are \*\*grab samplers, \*\*meaning that they tell you what's in the air at the moment you took the sample. Many other types of monitoring, including active and passive sampling, measure daily or weekly averages. The bucket can be used to test for up to 97 volatile organic compounds, as well as sulfur compounds.

> "The best analogy for the bucket is that old thing called a polaroid camera. If you take a picture, it's taking a sample at that particular time."
> Azibuike Akaba, co-author of the CBE Bucket Brigade Manual

> "The bucket is a self-empowering took allowing you to take control of campaigning. You don't have to depend on information from industry or government."
> Bobby Peek, founder of groundWork Friends of the Earth
