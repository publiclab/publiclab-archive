## About me

I'm Maria Nebesnaya. [Here](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/3679#issuecomment-433986237) are more information about me

@narnt on github and gitter

**Affiliation** (University of the People)

**Location:** (Russia)

## Project description

Expand community collaboration statistics and visualization system for [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org)

### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

Building community collaboration statistic system that will efficiently collect and appear data.

### Problem

There are several pages with statistics those needs to get a coherent shape.

# Ideas

# 

I'm to late to make mockups, but I have some ideas.

_I would like to see the main stats page more descriptive. In example, maybe those lines can be a table:_

_  
_

_In the past week: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_posted\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ joined_

_**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_16** notes\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**984** people_

_**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_76** wiki edits_

_In the past month:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_posted\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_joined_

_**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_73** notes\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**4005** people_

_**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_340** wiki edits_

_  
_

Maybe I'wrong, but for me a table will be more descriptive.

_We have 6 type of entries: notes, wiki, question/answers, comments and separatly tags. I think about a table like this:_

_  
_

_Notes\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Wiki\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Questions\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Answers\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Comments\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ period_

_tags: |\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|_

_  
_

In default it will show statistics in graphs for the whole period (and all entries type) from start, or maybe for this year. Than we can choose one or several types of entries, we can set period; below, in a tag field, we can add a tag to those querys and get a graph. Maybe in the right side will appear the most used tags for this query (if tags not chosen).

### Timeline/milestones

Mainly I worked on frontend tasks, but I want to expand my backend skills and work on it. I also will work in frontend tasks.

I like interactivity, animation and effects. Although it's not the most necessary part, it will make the project more descriptive and friendly for users, and it can be helpful. So if others won't mind and I will have finished other tasks, I will work on this.

**November:**

keep learning progect code base

keep learning Ruby on Rails

keep working on issues

test PublicLab website

make some issues, include fto

break up break-me-up issues

fit into the PublicLab community

**Outreachy weeks:**

**#1**

discuss functionality, design, project tasks

consider expanding interface design project

discuss which order tasks should be done

**#2**

discuss how must be standardized range page

break it up if it's needed

make an issue (issues) for it and perform this task

**#3 & #4**

review my code and think what I can improve

make first-time-poster tag script that will add this tag to all first-time posts

discuss stats page for subscribers for each tag, if it's needed

make issues for it and start working

**#5**

finish work on the stats page for subscribers for each tag

start working on stats for tags most used in this period

**#6**

finish work on stats for tags most used in this period

make an issue (issues) for questions and answers statistics page

work on it

**#7**

make an issue for making mirroring between stats and tags pages closer

work on it

make an issue for bar graph and work on it

**#8**

test stats pages

fix bugs

review and improve interface of those static pages if it's needed

**#9 & #10**

make a date selector

add an ability to click bar graphs to open that actual collection of items in a view

improve interface

if I missed something in this plan, it's time to do this

**#11 & #12**

review my code

test and fix bugs

if others don't mind, discuss and apply some css animation to interactive elements

### Needs

I will need helps from mentors to review my code. And it would be great to discuss improvements, ideas, and code with other contributors and mentors.

### First-time contribution

[https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/3820](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/3820)

[https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/3878](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/3878)

... and several in progress

### Experience

Two years ago I had started with learning html, css, and javascript because it was interesting and I was making a visual novel. I learned it on Russian websites. Then I had improved my English and started reading English articles about programming and documentations for programming languages, frameworks or other tools.

In this way I learned html, css, javascript, web animation, python, react, react native, less, sass, and so on. I also participated in the Django Girls workshop, and then continued learning Django.

I have never worked as programmer yet, but I fond of programming and participated in several projects. And this year I went to the college for pursuing BS in CS.

---------

### Teamwork

### 

I worked in small teams in two game development projects. I performed tasks mainly in front-end (include web-animation and css/js effects), but also in back-end, sound design, image processing.\_

Working in a team makes me happier :)

---------

### Passion

I fond of open source and open science too. Maybe now I don't have enough knowledges to do something meaningful for environmental, but I want to get those knowledges. Now I just try to decrease and sort my garbage, but in my country, I'm not sure what happens with sorted garbage then. When I was younger, I dreamed to become an alternative energy sources engineer, but then I didn't have possibilities to go to studying, and I denied from it. So if I can do something for better future and present, I will be glad. If I can do it with programming - I will do it.

### Audience

Todays and future PublicLab community and other people who want to improve environment.
