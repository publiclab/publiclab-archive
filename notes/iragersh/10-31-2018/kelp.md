### Introduction:

I would like to grow kelp in West Harlem Piers.  

### Our main concern:

I have never done this before.  I don't know how to start and what permits I should need.  

### Obstacles and supporting information:

Like the main concern.  Getting started and permits.  

### Who is engaged in this concern?

Bren Smith of Greenwave grows kelp.  

### What are the initial questions?

Will it grow?  If it grows, how fast will it grow?  Will small fish hang out near it?  What other critters will we find next to the kelp?
