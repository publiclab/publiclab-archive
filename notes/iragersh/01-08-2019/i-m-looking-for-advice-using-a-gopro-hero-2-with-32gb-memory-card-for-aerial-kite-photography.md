I've seen a youtube video on using a picavet mount.  I'd like to do this extremely cheaply.  I'm turned off by balloons because of the helium.  This would be done at HarborLab on the Newtown Creek initially.  I'm concerned because the area is very narrow.  I don't want the camera landing in the water  I have the camera, the kite, tools, hardware and wood and could make a mount pretty easily.  I don't want to photograph from much more than 60 feet. If I shot at an angle it might not need to be higher than 30 feet. I would set the camera on repetitive stills. I have several mounts for the goPro but don't have the simple through the hole mount.
