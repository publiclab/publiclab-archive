Hello, i'm a brazilian student from UFPR university, i am new to the community but very enthusiast of NDVI imaging.

  
I'm working on a project to map the health of the urban vegetation at my city.   

  
So I have build a platform for a car roof, this one:

In addition to a navigation system (Inertial + GNSS), and a Raspberry Pi 3, it haves a piNoir Camera v2\.  

  
So I went to a local store and I bought a sheet (50 x 60 cm) of the reccomended Rosco Supergel #19 (Fire), that is also on the DIY filter pack.    
  
And I've perceived: putting 2 sheets (i have cutted in small pieces) in front of my eyes, the image become redder__, with only one sheet, the image are more orangy like.  
  
So my doubt is: should I use more than 1 layer of rosco filter?  
  
I have another question, (i will state here, but please let me know if is better to make another post):

  
From the list of presets of [white balance for pi camera](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.10/api_camera.html "https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.10/api_camera.html") (`PiCamera.AWB_MODES`) there one most suitable one for NDVI imaging? (I supose "sunlight", because I will use it only in sunlight) Or there is a predefined tuple of "awb\_gains" (red and blue gains) to use in this case?  
  
Congratulations for all of this work, thank you in advance and sorry for my poor english!
