Nowadays, "Image processing" is generally employed by a good range of applications and in several sorts of electronics like computers, digital cameras, mobile phones, etc. 

The image properties are often changed with the smallest amount investment like contrast enhancement, borders detection, intensity measurement & apply different mathematical functions to reinforce the imagery. albeit these methods are often very influential, the buyer frequently controls images with the dump, but understanding the elemental values behind the effortless image processing routine is rare. 

Though this might be suitable for a few persons, it frequently results in an image that's extensively corrupted. during this article, we'll discuss the fundamentals of image processing and digital image processing projects using MATLAB, Python, etc.
The method of image processing is employed to try to to some processes on a picture like an image enhancement or to get rid of some functional data from the image. Image processing is one quite signal processing, where the input may be a picture, also because the output, are features or characteristics allied with the image.
At this time, the image processing technique is very used across different industries, which is employed to make core investigate regions in engineering also as in several disciplines too. Image Processing Projects
1). Raspberry Pi based Ball Tracing Robot
2). Surveillance Checking with Android Phone
3). Forgery Detection of Medical Image
4). Identification of Human Act by Image Processing
