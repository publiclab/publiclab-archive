Hi,  
Is there any correlation between Infragram, IR and Thermographic images ?  
  
I would like to experiment with thermovision,  unfortunately I don't have thermovision camera today, so I am looking for correlation between IR imaging, your Infragrams and theromovision  
  
Thank you for linking   
https://www.spectralpython.net/algorithms.html  
  
since I would like to process theromographic images, video to detect highest temperature region to detect temperature of human's face  
  
and finally,  
I tried https://sequencer.publiclab.org/examples/  
buit seems fail to work since all I can do is to select an image  
modules are n ot selectable,   
npone image or images sequence is generated as preview  
  
any idea ?  
  
thank you
