Hi,  
  
could you explain me why Image Sequencer from public webpage  
https://sequencer.publiclab.org/examples/  
fails to work  
either in Firefox or in Chrome  
  
All I can do is to open the above webpage, select .png image  
  
2\. "Select a new module to add to your sequence.  
  
fails to select any module  
  
Add Step \> adds nothing  
  
3\. "Save  \> Save as PNG, saves nothing  
Save as GIF (all steps), saves nothing  
Preview GIF, previews nothing, no action at all  
  
Could you verify the following webpage for bugs ?  
https://sequencer.publiclab.org/examples/  
  
The above web page is linked from  
https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer#experimental-gif-processing-support  
as  

## Examples

- [Simple Demo](https://sequencer.publiclab.org)
- [Latest Beta Demo](https://beta.sequencer.publiclab.org)

https://beta.sequencer.publiclab.org/examples/

results in the same no action, no image, no processing  
Frankly speaking I would prefer image processing based on HTML5, since I can build basic image filters on-the-fly  
and have direct access to R,G,B values for every image pixel  
  
Let me know your opinion  
  

thank you
