Processing a DVD to get a diffraction grating looks like so much work.  Amazon and eBay have linear diffraction gratings available in bulk -- package of 25 for $12.00 looks like a deal.  Key is buying a LINEAR single-axis grating film (multi-axis won't work for a spectrometer).  I just ordered the slide pictured, will try it out...  Anyone have comments or suggestions on this?

I'm making an integrating sphere for use with my spectrometer so I can calibrate light bulbs, I'll try to document the build and post it back here...
