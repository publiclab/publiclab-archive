## Background

**General Information:**
The Lower 9th Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement & Development (CSED) and Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana are partnering to host REPTILES AT THE BAYOU - Celebrating Halloween & Coastal Restoration. The exciting community event will feature costumes, pumpkins for the kids, over 20 local reptile species, free food and an educational bike tour for the first 30 people who [RSVP here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/halloween-coastal-restoration-bike-tour-reptiles-at-the-bayou-tickets-76118455349).

**Public Lab Table:**
Charlotte and Rollin, 2/3 of the Oil & Gas Water Fellowship Trio, will be at the event with some water samples and sensors to whet your appetite for learning about water quality. We'll compare the water quality of a number of samples from in and around the Lower Ninth Ward, and see how readings from a few different sensors compare to each other. If you have questions about how to monitor water, ideas about testing water in your community, or just want to say hi, it will be a great time to connect with us.

**The Bike Tour:**
The Bike Tour will run from 4-5:30pm and will make several stops including The Music Box's haunted house, where the levee breached during Katrina, Bayou Bienvenue, and several other locations. Everyone must register and sign our release and waiver form before joining us for the bike ride portion (release forms will be available before the event). Directions and additional details will be provided to registered participants via e-mail a few days prior to the event. Check in will take place from 3:30-4:00pm. If you need to cancel or have any questions please contact [volunteers@crcl.org](mailto:volunteers@crcl.org). We will be happy to help!

This event is a part of the Communities Restoring Urban Swamp Habitat project (or CRUSH), brought to you by EPA Gulf of Mexico Program and Entergy.
