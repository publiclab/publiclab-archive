• There is a lack of proper hierarchy

• Because of lack of sections, the page makes new users confused

• The lack of a navigation bar

I also worked on the responsiveness and provided a proposed design for the view on mobile

I redesigned the landing page to look less crowded yet not going far off from the original design. This new design provides a simple and friendly UI for users. This design uses the main logo colors and most of the call to action buttons are in the color of the logo
