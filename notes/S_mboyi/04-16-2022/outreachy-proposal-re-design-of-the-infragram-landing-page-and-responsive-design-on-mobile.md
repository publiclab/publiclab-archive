## About me

_An open source enthusiast studying computer engineering. Also a UI/UX designer and a front end web developer_

  
**Location:** Bamenda Cameroon

## Project description

### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

_I went through the Infragram website and here are some suggestions I have for the UI of the landing page of Infragram. I noticed some issues on the original landing page which are listed below;_

_• There is a lack of proper hierarchy_

_• Because of lack of sections, the page makes new users confused_

_• The lack of a navigation bar_

### Problem

_I redesigned the landing page to look less crowded yet not going far off from the original design. This new design provides a simple and friendly UI for users. This design uses the main logo colors and most of the call to action buttons are in the color of the logo_

_And I added a navigation bar for easier navigation and also added a sub Navigation bar on the landing page that directs to the various sections of the landing page_

_I also worked on the responsiveness and provided a proposed design for the view on mobile  
_

_  
_

### Timeline/milestones

_This design can be broken down into sections like on the page sections and one section is developed per week_

### Needs

_Will need content, data, documentation and some design software to edit the designs_
