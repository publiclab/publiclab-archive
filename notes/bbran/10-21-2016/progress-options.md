###What I want to do or know

Greetings, any recent progress on this. I was thinking of doing the same thing, except I have a zoom h2 recorder instead of the Olympus. Were you able to get this working? If so, was it only with the IR remote? The Zoom H2 doesnt have a remote so I would have to communicate with it directly through USB. Im wondering why you didnt do this and instead went with IR..

Any info greatly appreciated. 

###Background story
