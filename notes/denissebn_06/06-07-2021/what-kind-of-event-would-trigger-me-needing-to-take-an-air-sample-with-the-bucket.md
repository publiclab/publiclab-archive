I'm interested in monitoring my local air quality, what kind of event would trigger me needing to take a sample with the bucket monitoring tool (i.e. a grab sample)? It is the first time using the bucket monitoring tool for VVAMP. The team is trying to use the bucket the most effective way and gab the best air samples.
