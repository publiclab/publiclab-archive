What is kriging? How it works and how can we use it when measuring purple air?   

Kriging is a new term related to mapping statistics also known as Gausse Regression. I would like to learn more about it, understand It, and it relation to purple air. 

  
This question came out of a conversation with the Fellowship Team located in Val Verde, California, USA. Interested in learning more about their air quality monitoring project and following their progress? Follow us here: [VVAMP](https://publiclab.org/wiki/vvamp "https://publiclab.org/wiki/vvamp")
