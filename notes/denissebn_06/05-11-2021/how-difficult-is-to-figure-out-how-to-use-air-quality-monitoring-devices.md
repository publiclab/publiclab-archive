How easy or difficult was it to figure out how to use each one of them? What is the cost individually and do they need any extra materials?  

This question came out of a conversation with the Fellowship Team located in Val Verde, California, USA. Interested in learning more about their air quality monitoring project and following their progress? Follow us here: [VVAMP](https://publiclab.org/wiki/vvamp)
