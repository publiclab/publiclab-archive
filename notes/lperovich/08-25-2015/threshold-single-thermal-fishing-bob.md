Sara (@sara) and I wanted a threshold single thermal fishing bob for upcoming work on the Mystic River.  

Water regulations sometimes prohibit water temperatures above a certain value.  Thermal fishing bobs with this new code will light up red when they are above the set threshold value and will be off when the temperature is below the set threshold value.  This can be used to identify hot spots in the river than may exceed regulatory limits.

Here's the threshold single thermal fishing bob code:
