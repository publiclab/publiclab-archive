# how can I measure the wavelength of a red led? I suspect it is about 650nm but I want to know how to measure it. 

I put together a set of 40 red LEDs to test the theory put forth by NASA indicating that near infrared LEDs have shown to stimulate faster healing of a number of conditions including muscle and bone atrophy prevalent in astronauts.

I want to be able to measure the wavelength of different LEDs to experiment with combinations of different wavelengths.
