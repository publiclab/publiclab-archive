Not quite ready for primetime, but here's an attempted [NDVI conversion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrfE6A4jLE) of Chris Fastie's Bee Movie.

Scale is off, but with the few tweaks it'll likely bee much better.

Used python + ffmpeg for the process. Code, and details, are [on github](https://github.com/dwblair/infrapix-mov).

Also [gave NIR a shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0QZmk_Hzws).
