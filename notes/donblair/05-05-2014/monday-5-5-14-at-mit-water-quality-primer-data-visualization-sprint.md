Hey, Y'all -- there's going to be a Public Lab: Open Water meetup on Monday at MIT!  

NOTE: we got kicked off the earlier Hangout -- we're continuing here:


Here are the details:

**Time:** Monday, May 5th, from 9:30 AM to 12:30 PM

**Live Broadcast** (will be recorded & available for viewing afterwards, too):

**Location:** If you're nearby, we'll be in building / room E14-393 at MIT (it's a 3 minute walk from Kendall Square T stop on the Red Line in Cambridge, MA) 

**Agenda: **

1) 'Water Quality Primer'.  Jeff Walker is going to provide an informal overview of some of the key concepts associated with assessing water quality.  Some of the topics that might be covered include:

- conservative vs. non-conservative substances
- particulate vs. dissolved
- spatial patterns
- temporal patterns
- relationships and proxy variables
- dry weather vs wet weather
- flows, concentrations and loads
- messiness of wq data

2) Data visualization sprint. After the 'primer', we'll be digging into some basic water quality data (temperature, conductivity, depth), with a focus on coming up with some ways of visualizing this data that might be compelling for various audiences (concerned citizens / policymakers / watershed managers / researchers).  

If you have an interest in water quality issues and / or data visualization, please consider joining us.

Cheers!
