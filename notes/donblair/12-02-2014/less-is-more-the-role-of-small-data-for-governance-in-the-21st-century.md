A few months back, Diego Rafael Canabarro had graciously invited Catherine D'Ignazio, Jeff Warren and me to contribute a chapter to ['GOVERNANÃ‡A
DIGITAL'](http://www.ufrgs.br/cegov/files/livros/gtdigital.pdf) -- a new text out of [UFGRS](http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home) edited by Diego and by Marcelo Soares Pimenta. 

The result (thanks, [Diego](https://twitter.com/diegorrcc)!) is here:

> <a href="https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/189/original/CEGOV_Digital_Governance_2014_Chapter6.pdf"><i class="icon icon-file"></i> Chapter 6: "Less is More: The Role of Small Data in 21st Century Governance"</a>

In this chapter -- inspired by Jeff's [article](http://techpresident.com/news/24176/backchannel-promise-small-data) from last year on 'Small Data', and incorporating insights from Ethan's [blog post](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2014/04/20/water-monitoring-in-china-and-the-changing-role-of-citizenship/) on recent citizen water monitoring efforts in China -- we pose a series of questions about 'Small Data': 

- What is 'Small Data'?
- Isn't it enough that my organization already makes data publicly available online?
- Can the public comprehend scientific results without special training?
- Is a bottom-up, grassroots, Small Data approach compatible with 'real science'?
- What about data validity?
- What does Small Data look like in practice?
- What about privacy and data ownership?
- Can my organization invest in both Big Data and Small Data?
- What problems might we usefully address with a Small Data approach?
- What are the challenges for the Small Data approach, going forward?

We then attempt to sketch out some answers, drawing upon our recent experiences working on the [Open Water Project](http://openwaterproject.io/) and citing examples from [Dorn Cox](http://makezine.com/magazine/open-sourcing-our-food-system-with-farm-hack/)'s 'open source agriculture' projects in the [FarmHack](http://farmhack.net/) community.

Any feedback on the chapter -- or thoughts on any of the issues highlighted above -- would be very welcome!

Cheers,
dwb
