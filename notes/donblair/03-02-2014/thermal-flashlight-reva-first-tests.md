###What I want to do

Test out a design for the Thermal Flashlight project.  

To measure from the IR sensor, I'm using the Adafruit library, here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-MLX90614-Library

The current firmware on the thermal flashlight device is here:
https://gist.github.com/dwblair/9297914

###My attempt and results

A big shout out to Rui Wang of http://rayshobby.net/ -- not only did I base my thermal flashlight design on the innards of his awesome (open source) [SquareWear](https://github.com/rayshobby/squarewear) project, but he showed me how to assemble the resultant board (for which he had most of the components readily available) -- he did it nearly completely himself, including working around some goof-ups in my design.

Also -- thanks to Jake Wheeler of [Hacker Farm](http://hackerfarm01007.org) for sifting through HF's stockpile of electronics on short notice, and finding the crucial 32u4 processor part for this device!

And the result of all of this collaboration is ... *it works!*

Here's a video that describes the design, and shows a basic demo of the flashlight in action:

Issues with the design (to be fixed in the next iteration):

- The "reset" pin on the ISP programmer part of the board (necessary to load the bootloader onto the chip) was disconnected -- Rui found a way around it by connecting to the RESET pin on the reset button

- I left solder mask on top of the IR sensor pads (was able to scrape it off).  Need to fix that.
###Questions and next steps

- Need to write more sophisticated code for testing out the board, and try it out with the web app that has been written for this purpose. 

- Test out the geiger counter-like buzzer. 

###Why I'm interested

A thermal flashlight device would be a super cool way to assess e.g. thermal leaks in the home.
