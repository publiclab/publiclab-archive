Herein, please find a long-overdue update on the maiden flight of the <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/donblair/9-20-2012/raspberry-pi-sky">Raspberry Pi in the Sky</a> design that Craig Versek put together for <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/9-5-2012/l-e-f-f-e-s-t">LEAFFEST</a> in September.   
 
<b>The Goal</b>:  live video from an aerial Raspberry Pi + wireless dongle + webcam.  Any WiFi-capable device with a browser can log into the web page served by the device, and see what its camera is seeing.

<b>Progress Report</b>:  With a lot of last-minute sweat, minimal tears, and no visible bleeding, Craig was able to get the device to transmit and receive the images, live, as the R-Pi-in-Sky dangled from a kite flown by Chris Fastie; on the ground, we had (at least) two laptops logged into a web page served by the R-Pi, and recorded video and stills on both.

Chris Fastie put together a fantastic video of the device being attached to a kite, and has included a montage of images that were broadcast by the device itself.  Check it out here:

We'll hope to be updating this note with Craig's R-Pi code, and more technical details on the setup, soon.

<b>Future Work</b>:  The transmission rate was a bit choppy.  We think that with a directional antenna on the ground, we might do better.
