Hello again!

This is just a quick research note in an attempt to catch up with [John Keefe](http://johnkeefe.net/)'s amazing water monitoring work recently.  John works at WNYC for their [Data News Team](http://datanews.wnyc.org/), and contacted Public Lab a while back after seeing Catherine D'Ignazio present on the Open Water Project.  He was particularly interested in the [Riffle](http://publiclab.org/wiki/riffle), which is a water monitoring datalogger that fits in a standard 500 mL water bottle.  He had been [selected by West Virginia University's Reed College of Media](http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/n/2015/07/24/wvu-college-of-media-launches-water-quality-reporting-project-with-two-new-innovators-in-residence) as an 'Innovator-In-Residence', and, inspired by Catherine's presentation, decided to teach a 'data journalism' class focused on DIY water monitoring technology.  

I'm still trying to collect all of the fantastic coverage that John's project has already garnered; for now, here's a collection of links to his blog posts on the project, in chronological order -- it's neat to see how the project developed!

And here's a link to 'live data' -- note that the batteries on the devices had run out, and it looks like they *just* had new batteries put in (perhaps in a classroom -- current conductivity is reading 'zero' :)) -- perhaps they'll be redeployed by the end of the day!
