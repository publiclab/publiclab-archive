###What I want to do

As explained in an earlier research note, we're looking to [measure the conductivity of water using a 555 timer](http://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/05-28-2014/riffle-dev-fun-w-five-five-fives).  The ideal frequency range of our setup is around 1 kHz, and we're going to need to be able to measure oscillations of this frequency with an Arduino -- which might require some tricks.  I'm going to build this research note out as I go along, but for now, I'm just collecting a bunch of "Reference" links online that seemed relevant (sorry it's all jumbled, for now) ...

([Source](http://www.tingiant.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/555timer.png) for this fantastic depiction of the 555's internals.)

[UPDATE]

I think I've got working code now!  I'll need to come back and document this more fully, but the wiring is more or less as described in the linked-to-research-note above, and the code is fairly well commented, here:

1 Î¼S/cm is then equivalent to about 0.64 mg of NaCl per kg of water.

two metal screws about a bottle cap away in water seem to have a resistivity of ~ 160 kOhms
