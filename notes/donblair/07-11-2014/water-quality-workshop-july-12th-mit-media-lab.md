### When: July 12th, 2014

### Where:  MIT Media Lab, Room 525

### RSVP: 

Please RSVP [here](http://donblair.eventbee.com/event?eid=141525123) so that we can make sure we'll have enough space for you there!

### What:

On July 12th, 2014, in the Medial Lab at MIT, Public Lab's Open Water Project will be hosting an "Intro to Water Quality" workshop from 11 AM to 5 PM.  We'll have space for up to 20 folks, and we'll be hoping to dig into questions like:

- How does one measure 'water quality'?
- Can we come up with some creative new ways of measuring water quality ourselves, and displaying the results in ways that are easy for us and others to understand?

We'll probably be honing in on 'conductivity' as a particular measure of water quality, and we hope to have some hands-on demos of how conductivity is measured.  Mostly, we're hoping to get everyone involved to start brainstorming about ways of raising awareness in their communities about their local water quality problems, potential ways of assessing them, and possible ways of addressing the problem.  And: to have fun while doing it!

Please join us if you'll have time -- and make sure to [RSVP](http://donblair.eventbee.com/event?eid=141525123), so we'll know we have space for you!
