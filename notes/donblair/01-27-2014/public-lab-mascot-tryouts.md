###What I want to do

Locate a Public Lab mascot. 

###My attempt and results

Turns out that Ben Gamari has a pet [Gulf Coast Box turtle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_box_turtle), named "T".  She turtle often wears a knitted sweater in the winter.

###Questions and next steps

We're not sure of the T's availability for Public Lab mascot duties; but she didn't seem particularly bothered by the addition of a "Public Lab" sign on her sweater.

###Why I'm interested

Because turtles.
