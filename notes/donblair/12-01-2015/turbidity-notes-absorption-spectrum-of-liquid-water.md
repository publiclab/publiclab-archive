Why I'm interested:

At the Barnraising, it was suggested that near-infrared light from the sun is attenuated significantly at a depth of a few feet in water.  This is a quick pass at trying to dig into this.  If it's true, then it could be that a turbidity sensor at a depth of a few feet that relied on a NIR wavelength wouldn't need much protection from ambient sunlight ...
