# Using an Audio Jack to Assess Conductivity

###What I want to do

Try Mat Lippincott's idea:  use the nicely-standardized electrodes on the end of an audio jack:

[![Audio-TRS-Mini-Plug.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/004/850/medium/Audio-TRS-Mini-Plug.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/004/850/original/Audio-TRS-Mini-Plug.jpg)

as conductivity probes in order to assess the conductivity of water (an important water quality measurement). 

###My attempt and results

NOTE: I somehow goofed up when uploading the video, so I've got about 30 seconds of silence at the beginning :)  Here's a direct link to where the video actually begins:

- Another note on the video: I seem to have referred to pretty much every piece of metal in the set up as a 'jack'.  Will proceed to refer to everyone I meet today as Jack.  And I plan to solicit comments on the above video from Jack Summers.

###Questions and next steps

- Need to find a nice way of measuring out known amounts of salt.  Cheap microgram scale? 
- Set up a basic 555 timer conductivity measurement circuit using an audio jack.
