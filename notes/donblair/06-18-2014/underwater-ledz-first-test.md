###What I want to do

Test out these claims that [mineral oil is a terrible conductor](http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/cooling-a-computer-server-with-mineral-oil/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0) by doing a little home experiment.

###My attempt and results

###Questions and next steps

- Would filling a water bottle with mineral oil be a nice way of making sure that the flimsy plastic retains its shape deep underwater?  

- Only one way to find out ... 

###Why I'm interested

- It'd be neat to use recycled water bottles as enclosures for underwater datalogging electronics; but they might warp with the pressure at depth.  Filling the container with mineral oil is a (potentially terrible impractical) way of retaining the enclosure's shape, so that the waterproof seal doesn't break.  Not sure how environmentalists will feel about sending an oil refinery by-product underwater to monitor the effects of oil spills ... but anyway, this experiment was fun!
