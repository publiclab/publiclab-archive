@mathew and I had a great trip EPA's Advanced Monitoring Tech Demo Day on August 5th at the EPA's headquarters in DC.  Catherine Tunis and others at the EPA organized a wonderful event -- we met a ton of folks who were really interested in Public Lab's approach to environmental monitoring, and it has led to lots of great conversations!

I'll be posting more details here soon, but just wanted to put a quick link to the poster we put together for the event, which turned out nicely:

Here's a snapshot of the poster as it was set up next to our table:

-- thanks to Jennifer Wills, who [posted the photo on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jenniferwills/status/496733712172978177/photo/1)!  We totally forgot to take any pictures of our demo setup -- we were so busy talking to people!  It was a really neat demo, though -- trust us.  Buzzers and water and salt and Riffles and all that jazz.  More description soon.

Big thanks to @kanarinka, @lilybui, and @walkerjeffd for helpful feedback on the poster;  to @walkerjeffd for all of the data analysis ... and to Katie Booras, who arranged for the entire City of Cambridge Water Dept deployment around which the poster is based!
