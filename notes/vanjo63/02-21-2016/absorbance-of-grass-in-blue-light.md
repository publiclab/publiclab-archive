Hello everybody, I am a student in biochemistry at the University of Liège in Belgium, and I have a huge scientific curiosity so I decided to build my own spectrometer, with the help of Spectral Workbench informations of course, in order to analyse the spectrum of many many samples.
I realised many tests, and I decided to focus my "work" on concrete things.

I think that is important to clarify that is my first research note and that I speak French, so I am sorry for the possible mistakes of English language.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will present you the spectrum of grass extract.
To do that, I picked some grass in my garden, I add water and press the grass to extract ... chloroplasts I presume :D This is my "stock solution".

Here is a picture of my spectrometer :
[![Spectro_André_V2.0.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/014/503/medium/Spectro_Andr%C3%A9_V2.0.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/014/503/original/Spectro_Andr%C3%A9_V2.0.jpg)

So, I analysed my stock solution in a dilution 8X. I used water for the blank and I used a LED RGB but i lighted only with a blue light.
I collected results and analysed them. Here is a graph with the spectrum of the blank, the sample and the difference of both (it is absorbance) :

We observe 2 maximums of absorbance, at wavelength corresponding of maximum of absorbance of chlorophyll A (~430 nm) and chlorophyll B (~445 nm).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The spectrum is not very accurate and the resolution is weak, so it is a good idea to improve my spectrometer to increase the resolution and accuracy of my future spectrum.
I realised the same experiment with a red light, but results are not enough usable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that my results are significant, and that stimulate myself to continue and perform a lot of spectrum of many samples.
