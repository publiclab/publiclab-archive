I assembled one of your foldable paper spectrometers, and I think I followed the directions correctly, but I get inconsistent spectra , and I am wondering if there is an app for using it on an iPhone. On your site there is a picture of an iPhone with an interface that seems to say "Capture".

Also, I can't seem to get a horizontal spectrum no matter how I orient the CD fragment; it's either a vertical spectrum or very scattered (see pics).

I am high school chemistry teacher trying to use this device with my students.
