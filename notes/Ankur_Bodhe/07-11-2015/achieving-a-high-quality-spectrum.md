Hey Guys,
So I wanted to use the spectrometer to Characterize Carbon Nanotubes.
I used a 50 W halogen lamp and follwed the procedure as given in the manual of the DIY spectrometer by Public Labs.
However, I am not able to achieve a sharp spectrum.
I have tried:
1) Changing the angle of inclination of the gumstick camera
2) changing the diffraction grating
3) changing the distance between the grating and the slit
4) changing the focus of the gumstick camera
Despite changing the bove mentioned parameters, I havent achieved satisfactory results.
I have attached a picture of the spectrum I've got so far.
Would like to know where is the problem and how to rectify it.
