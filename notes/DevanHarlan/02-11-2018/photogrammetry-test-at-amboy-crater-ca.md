**Description:**

Aerial photography and 3D photogrammetry conducted while in residence at JTHAR, (Joshua Tree Highland Artist Residency Program). The project is an artistic investigation of the landscape but may be relevant to citizen scientists or others exploring balloon mapping and/or photogrammetry. Some ideas here were borrowed from HAB photography methods.

**Materials:**

- Public Lab Balloon Mapping Kit
- 8ft Cloud Buster Neoprene Balloon
- Helium (K Size Tank)
- Two Canon Powershot G10 cameras running [CHDK](http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK)
- Styrofoam beer cooler
- Duct Tape / Zip Ties
- Bungee cords / Tarp

**Preparation:**

I was working completely alone for this project, which I highly discourage. Regardless this was the method. The balloon was inflated from a K-Type Helium tank in the back of a rented U-Haul Pickup. Tarp and rubber bungee cords were used to hold the balloon down during inflation.

**Camera Box:**

I had originally mounted the cameras in a styrofoam cooler with a wooden dowel running through the box. Additional foam inside positioned the cameras on opposite sides of the box, at a roughly 25-degree angle to the ground.

**Improvisation:**

This worked fine on a previous flight test, but I had a problem. The helium tank had less gas remaining than I had estimated, so the balloon was not completely inflated. I tried to fly it anyway but after 30 mins the balloon was not able to make an ascent as the load was too heavy.

I cut down everything unnecessary from the foam box, including redundant carabiners, clips or line. This is the result and it actually worked out well:

**Results:**

The cameras were set to shutter priority mode at about 1/650 sec. Using CHDK they were set to shoot in interval mode every 10 seconds. The shots were clear and more than adequate for photogrammetry. I did achieve some nice photos and good results with the 3D models.

\*\*  
\*\*

**Failures:**

- The cameras were not positioned in the styrofoam perfectly. All shots have white foam visible in the corners of the frame.
- Because of the lost time with the helium miscalculation and rebuilding the camera rig I lost about 45 mins of battery life on the cameras. This meant the camera batteries died precisely when I reached the crater and I did not get photography of the ascent to the summit. If I had been aware at the time there are settings in CHDK to optimize the battery life. Better luck next time.

**3D Photogrammetry**

The assembled map below is a 3D mesh produced using Autodesk Remake (now Autodesk Recap Photo). The model is automatically UV textured with the original photography. Here are a few orthographic views rendered in Cinema 4D with Physical Sky lighting.
