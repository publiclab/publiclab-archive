We've been exploring the Turkey Creek Watershed in Gulfport, Mississippi with the Steps Coalition and the Boys and Girls Club. On March 14th we did our first balloon mapping of the site. We caught some good images, but had some trouble with our camera slipping at an angle inside the rig (we were using a faucet cover rig), so some of them came out a little distorted and you can see the corner of the rig in a lot of the images.

Looking forward to our next workshop learning about water quality monitoring at this site!
