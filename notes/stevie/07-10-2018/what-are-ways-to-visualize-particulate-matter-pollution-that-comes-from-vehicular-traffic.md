I've been speaking with a community member in Mobile County, Alabama who has been struggling with an adjacent gravel and asphalt processing facilities, and the dust their trucks cause around his home. 

We're interested in exploring more ways to advocate and talk about this issue and want to know more about what types of monitoring might be useful. We're particularly interested in monitoring that produces visual data around this issue.
