In our open call last week, we were talking about the [microscope-basic](https://publiclab.org/wiki/basic-microscope) project and how to capture images of particulate matter. We were wondering if a guide or template could be created for taking these images. I think we could do this if we identify what information would need to be stored with the slide images. Anyone have ideas on what should be included?
