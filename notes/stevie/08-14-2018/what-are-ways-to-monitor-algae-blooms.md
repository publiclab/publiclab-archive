I was in conversation with a fisherfolk group in Mississippi yesterday who is interested in monitoring algae blooms. Keeping an eye on the troubling situation happening in [Florida right now](https://www.google.com/search?q=algae+bloom&oq=algea&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l5.4817j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), I've started thinking more about this. 

We did an activity a couple months back to see if we could see an algae bloom in Lake Pontchartrain using the Public Lab Near Infrared cameras, but we missed the bloom and couldn't see it. Anyone have thoughts on if the NIR camera would work for this or ideas for other ways to monitor blooms?
