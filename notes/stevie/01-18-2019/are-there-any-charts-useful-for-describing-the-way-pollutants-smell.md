We're interested in doing the next Community Science Publication on Odor. One thing that might be interesting for this is to include a chart or material that could help people either describe odors they smell in the air, or that links pollutants to particular smells. I've [found this chart][1], and I'm wondering what people think about it. It seems like it might need an update. Are there other materials like this we could pull from?
