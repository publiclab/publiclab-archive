###My research interest: 
Jackson County is Mississippi's 'most industrialized county' with 12 facilities reporting to the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory. Mississippi Phosphate, a company that produces chemicals used in fertilizers, accounts for 23% of the total TRI releases in Jackson County. Out of the entire United States, this company ranks 84th on the list of most polluting chemical companies, a list that is 2,927 industries long. Their reported releases include: 810,049 pounds of ammonia into the air, 48,298 pounds of sulfuric acid to the air, 8,325 pounds of lead to land and more. In their most recent TRI report (2012), the company releases total over 1,090,932 pounds of pollutants into the local environment. Since 2009, the MDEQ has only issued 12 'cease-and-desist' orders, four of which have been to this plant. 


###Questions and next steps:
Looking for suggestions in air quality monitoring techniques for local residents. Ammonia and other acids are a major concern. 


###Why I'm interested:
Local residents of Pascagoula Mississippi are worried about the pollutants in their community.  Today's Sun Herald reported that 'a neighborhood of 150 homes across industrial Bayou Casotte from Mississippi Phosphates was complaining about acid smells and health problems while being plagued by dust, noise and vapors.' 
And for me personally, there is Alice, a dear friend and 96 year old grandmother who lives in this neighborhood. She deserves better air to breathe.
