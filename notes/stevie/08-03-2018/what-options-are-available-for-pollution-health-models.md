Question shared by Mike Ewall of [Energy Justice Network][1] 

"Have any of you used pollution/health models where you can plug in the emissions data from a facility -- and probably local population info -- and come out with projections on how many people will die prematurely, suffer from additional asthma attacks, heart attacks/strokes, or other health outcomes? If there's something like that I can use, which isn't more complicated than I can handle, that would be super useful in some of my work right now."
