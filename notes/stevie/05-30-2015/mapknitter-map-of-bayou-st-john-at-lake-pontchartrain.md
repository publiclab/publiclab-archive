Map of Bayou St John at Lake Pontchartrain on May 30, 2015

Drove from City Park to this site (~4 miles) with the balloon in the back of a truck with Stevie holding it down. We had to drive at 9 miles per hour to keep from popping the balloon. A net might work better to hold the balloon down in the back of the truck. Need thicker gloves to pull the  balloon back down (Blisters, Ouch!).
