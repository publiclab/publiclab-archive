Join Public Lab for a Frac Sand Tools for Action event, Tuesday August 4th from 6-8 at [the Raw Deal](http://www.rawdeal-wi.com/) in Menomonie, WI. </br>

_Explore_ some of the low cost dust sensing technologies the Public Lab community has been developing.  </br>
_Tinker_ with new water sensing tools.  </br>
_Talk_ with others about ways we can collect valuable data to hold frac sand companies accountable.  </br>
_Design_ a program for holding frac sand companies accountable that integrates these tools with your community. </br>
_Engage_ on the issues that are affecting you!  </br>

Last year Public Lab hosted [The Dust Hack event](http://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/11-10-2014/the-dusthack-report) at the Hundredth Monkey Maker space to explore the frac sand issue from the perspective of what was available for low cost dust monitoring. Not only did we explore the technologies that were available to us for monitoring dust and silica, we also fell into discussing water tools and how low cost water technology might be able to help us hold frac sand companies responsible for local pollution events.   </br>

Lessons learned from the Dust Hack event have helped to shape Public Lab tool development in dust monitoring and inspired the Public Lab community to take on low cost water sensing! Join us Tuesday, August 4th for an event to explore the low cost open source tools that are developing from these discussions.  </br>

See you @ The Raw Deal!
