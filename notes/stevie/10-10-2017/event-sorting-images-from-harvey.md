In the aftermath of Harvey, tracking pollution events related to the hurricane has been a daunting task. [Gulf Restoration Network][1] (GRN) has been working hard to capture these pollution events and take steps towards accountability and cleanup. GRN has identified that the NOAA satellite imagery set that was captured just after the hurricane has a lot of images in it of potential spills. They could use help going through these images looking for pollution. The more support GRN can get in finding the spills, the more they can focus on making sure they are dealt with appropriately. You can do this [on your own][2], or join us to do it in person Thursday! 

**When:** Thursday, October 12th from 6-8 

**Where:** The Warehouse (3014 Dauphine Street, New Orleans), conference room 1

**What:** We'll have dinner and run through [this activity together][3]. 

**What do I need?** If you can, bring a computer you can work from, if you don't have one, we'll have some extras.
