##Join us for an evening of exploring spectrometry! 

Could you identify a substance just by looking at it? By smelling it? By touch? Or dare you taste?! 
- What if I told you that you could build a tool that could help you identify your mysterious substance.  **A spectrometer!** _What would that mean?_ - I challenge you to find out! 

This event will be held at [Propeller](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Propeller+Incubator/@29.951597,-90.100804,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x7f07a5021eb236ac) (4035 Washington Ave, New Orleans, LA 70125) Thursday, July 31st from 5:30-7:30. 

There you will build your own spectrometer, learn what it means to use it and attempt to put these questions to practice. We will provide the tools, some guidance, and a little brain food. You bring your laptop or smartphone (if you have those available to you, if not no worries we have some to share) and your thinking cap. Together we will explore this idea.  

RSVP by filling out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Esdav7PEO5-Hl5dWGR_IOOkXUl6ScEOKuNcnSU61zfE/viewform?usp=send_form) or emailing stevie@publiclab.org. Don't hesitate to be in touch with questions or ideas!
