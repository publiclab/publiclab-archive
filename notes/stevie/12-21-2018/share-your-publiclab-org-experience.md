Are you new to Public Lab? We want to hear from you! Public Lab is looking for people to connect with for a user experience research project. We want to learn more about how you navigate PublicLab.org so that we can improve your experience on the website. We are offering $100 stipends for selected participants* for one hour of your time.

**What does my involvement mean?** 

You will participate in a short usability test of the Public Lab website that will take 20-25 minutes long. In this usability test, you will share your Public Lab web browsing screen with an interviewer who will watch you navigate the website as you talk through how you use it. There will be a short interview 10-15 min afterwards that will explore your background, and your interest in Public Lab. 

**Why is this important?**

We want to make sure Public Lab is a place where you can come and easily find what you're looking for and accomplish your goals. We believe that if we listen to you, and watch how you navigate through tasks, so we can make changes to the website to improve your future Public Lab experience.

**Who can do this?**

We are looking for a diverse group of ten-twenty participants from the United States in this project, particularly those who are new to Public Lab. If you are interested, please click on the link at the bottom of the page and fill out the form. We will be in touch! 

**What will I need to participate?**

You will need a computer with internet and a microphone, (we can test this with you ahead of time) and an hour of time. If you are selected, we will do our best to work around your schedule and can work with you to make this process as smooth as possible. 

**How will I get the money?**

Once our session is complete, we will send you a check for $100.
