###Setting the camera to time-lapse mode

There is a small button on the bottom of the camera on the inside where my finger is pointing below.

The button slides. Left is "off," middle is "test," and right is "on." To set the camera in time-lapse mode make sure the button is in the middle in "test" mode.

Press the "Menu" button to turn on the camera and pull up the menu:

On the main menu, press the down button continuously until you find "Time Lapse" option, which is beyond the immediately visible list of options and press "OK." Select "on" then you will see a screen that will allow you to set the amount of time you want in between each photo taken. the left hand side is in hours, the middle is minutes and the right is seconds.

You can set the hours, minutes and/or seconds by using the small up/down arrows which only appear when you highlight the hours, minutes or seconds. You can set to have the camera take as few as one photo per day to as many as one photo per second. When you have finished setting the time, press the "ok" button. When you are done with that, press the menu button again.

Now you are ready to take time-lapse photos. **When you set your camera out, make sure you move the button on the bottom all the way to the right to "On."**

The middle "test" feature can help you make sure you're capturing everything you want in your photo by showing you blue and red lights, (for moving in and out of range- blue for in the camera view, red for out), but it will not take photos. For the camera to take photos it must be set to "on."
