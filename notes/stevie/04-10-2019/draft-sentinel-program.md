Back in September, a number of people from around the Midwest who are fighting frac sand mining issues hosted a couple check in meetings on how things were going, sharing notes on some projects to date (you can read about the conversations [here][1] and [here][2]). We also had an opportunity to loop in on pathways forward people were seeing that were new, or could use some more attention. 

I want to post an update on one of the projects that came up in those September conversations. With support from a number of groups and individuals, we've started to work on the Sentinel Program, originally conceived of by @Pat. This project is aimed at making reporting suspected violations from the frac sand mining industry easier to do.  

So far on this project we have:

- Collected materials people have used in the past in filing suspected violations, 
- Compiled a list of violations that could be observable by people, 
- Collected resources on where materials can be reported to,
- Compiled a reporting form with information on what could be collected to support people's observations, and
- Created a draft reporting form folder. 

I wanted to share out the materials so far, and am looking for edits, ideas, and further suggestions. You can comment below or in the [doc itself here.][3] We'll also be going over some of this material at the event on [Saturday in Arcadia][4].
