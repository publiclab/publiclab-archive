I'm looking to set up a few activities that people could try in testing out data loggers in the water. Some of the ones Iâ€™ve been thinking about are: 
 
- running them in a bucket of water, 
- two loggers in the same place, and 
- for something more field based, an upstream, downstream test. 
 
Does anyone know of an activity posted or one that could be pulled together?
