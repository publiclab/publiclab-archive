#### About Public Lab

By democratizing inexpensive and accessible do-it-yourself techniques, Public Lab creates a collaborative network of practitioners who actively reimagine the human relationship with the environment.

#### About the Fellowship

This Fellowship is part of the [Oil & Gas Water Fellows Trio](https://publiclab.org/wiki/fellows) and is an opportunity to research and document water monitoring methods used by people to collect evidence on the environmental impacts of the oil & gas industry.

The major goals of this Fellowship are

1.) To research and post documentation on Public Lab on methods used by watershed groups, watchdog groups, states, universities, and individuals to organize and advocate for improvements on water quality issues in areas affected by the oil & gas industry.

2.) To connect with individuals who do this type of monitoring, conduct interviews, and document their stories and experiences related to this work on [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org).

3.) To work in collaboration with the Hardware and Community Fellows to draft and compile materials for a "Research Area Review" on water quality monitoring on [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org).

#### You will:

- Identify methods used by water quality monitoring groups who are working in states with oil & gas extraction issues.
- Draft research note documentation on [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org) detailing use cases for specific methods people use for water quality monitoring.
- Interview, compile, and share monitoring and advocacy stories on [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org) from people who have used water monitoring methods related to oil & gas concerns.
- Develop a wiki page that highlights the different ways that people do water quality monitoring and design advocacy campaigns, in a way that helps someone choose one approach over another.
- Identify ways for people with concerns around water quality to get started in monitoring.
- Engage the Public Lab community in-person and remote on questions and resources related to methods used in water quality monitoring.
- Support the work of the other Oil & Gas Water Fellows by helping to match concerns communities share around contamination to study designs, and monitoring tools that could be appropriate to use.
- Work with the Hardware and Community Fellows to run a "Research Area Review" for water quality monitoring, including soliciting input from peer groups on the state of water quality monitoring, updating documentation on [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org "http://publiclab.org/") related to current water quality monitoring methods available through the Public Lab store, seed and help answer questions for others to help answer on water quality monitoring, and organize and participate in an OpenHour interactive seminar on the state of water quality monitoring in relation to oil and gas concerns.
- Join the Public Lab Oil & Gas Slack channel.
- When possible, attend a weekly Fellows call or check in with weekly project updates.
- Maintain and adhere to nonprofit policies and procedures, Public Lab values, and the [Code of Conduct](https://publiclab.org/conduct).
