This week, Wendy Johnson & Jim Tittle of Midwest Pictures, LLC released their new documentary "[Promise in the Sand][2]" about frack sand mining in the Driftless region. The 24 minute piece follows the communities still struggling with the economic, environmental, and human health impacts of this arm of the fracking industry. Friends featured in this piece include the Swenson family (@dswenson), and Hank Bochon (referenced in the [Community Science Forum: the frac sand issue here][3]) of www.lookdownpictures.com. "Promise in the Sand" is a follow up to Midwest Pictures' first documentary on the frack sand mining issue, "[The Price of Sand][4]," that was released in 2013. It also comes on the heals of Dr. Thomas Pearson's recent book, "[When the Hills are Gone: Frac Sand Mining and the Struggle for Community][5]."
