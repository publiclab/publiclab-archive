# New Orleans Training Event! 

###Event details
At this event, we will learn about Public Lab aerial mapping. We will go over how aerial mapping works including the tools we use, technologies that help us build maps and best practices to make your project successful. We will also spend time building our own rigs for the local mapping events to follow! 


###Meetup Specs.
**When:** Thursday, September 18th, 5:30-7:30 _Light refreshments provided._

**Where: **Propeller Incubator 4035 Washington Ave, New Orleans, LA 70125

**Should I bring anything? **
We will build camera rigs for mapping. If you have an extra 2 liter bottle, repurpose it here for your new camera rig. Also, if you have a small digital camera you'd like to practice setting up your rig with, bring that along too! 


###Background
This event is a training session for people interested in learning about aerial mapping. It will be useful to those interested in participating in the [Urban Waters Restoration Mapping Project]( http://publiclab.org/wiki/gulf-coast) starting in October.
