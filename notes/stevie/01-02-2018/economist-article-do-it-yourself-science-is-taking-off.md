Public Lab and some DIY science friends (Hey @maxliboiron, @eymund, @shannon and @warren !) were recently featured in a piece in The Economist. Check out the article entitled "[Do-it-yourself science is taking off][1]."

Happy New Year to all, and a special welcome to everyone who has found Public Lab and DIY science projects through The Economist piece!
