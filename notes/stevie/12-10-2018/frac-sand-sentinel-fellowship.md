The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (Public Lab) is a community, supported by a 501(c)(3) non-profit--which develops and applies open-source tools to environmental exploration and investigation. By democratizing inexpensive and accessible Do-it-Yourself techniques, Public Lab creates a collaborative network of practitioners who actively re-imagine the human relationship with the environment.

Frac Sand Sentinel is an informational newsletter highlighting resource links, news media accounts, blog posts, correspondence, observations and opinions gathered regarding local actions on, and impacts of, the developing frac sand mining and processing industries. 

This fellowship is a joint opportunity from Public Lab and the Frac Sand Sentinel for an individual to work on compiling and drafting materials for communities to collect and file reports on suspected permit violations from frac sand mining companies. The two major goals of this fellowship are:

1) To sort, and organize materials that would go into a reporting form folder and update information on where reporting information should go.  

2) To share methods for how to file reports publiclab.org for others to follow online.  

**The Fellow will:**

- Research community reporting methods from existing materials, 
- Create materials for reporting which include information on how to monitor for violations, report suspected violations, and follow up on reports made,
- Post materials to a frac sand accountability methods page on PublicLab.org, 
- Compile materials into easy to print documents that can be used in training events, 
- Update a printed database for where reporting information should be sent,
- Engage the broader local and Public Lab community through the Public Lab google groups and online forum on questions and resources related to monitoring violations and frac sand mine development activities, 
- Gather available community data on frac sand mine impacts and develop a summary of these data for public distribution,
- Assist in publications of the Frac Sand Sentinel, a regular online publication about the frac sand issue,
- Attend a weekly Public Lab staff call,
- Assist as notetaker with upcoming rural “Project Outreach” events when available,*
- Maintain and adhere to nonprofit policies and procedures, Public Lab values, and the [Code of Conduct][1].

_This fellowship is not location restricted, and does not require travel, however opportunities for attending and assisting with local events in Western Wisconsin will be available during this time._

**Skills, knowledge, and abilities required:**

- Excellent communication skills in online, written, and verbal formats;
- Ability to work collaboratively, both in-person and with remote colleagues, to envision and promote positive change, and to be supportive of others;
- Ability to facilitate activities amongst a highly diverse community of people from many different fields and experiences;
- Technical proficiency (with full support from colleagues)--ability to learn, disseminate, and teach about technology and reporting in the context of advocacy.
 
This fellowship will be hosted through Public Lab. Public Lab is committed to a diverse, multicultural work environment. We encourage people with different ability sets, people of color, and people of diverse sexual orientations, gender expressions, and identities to apply.
