_We’re compiling resources to help people host Barnraisings!_ 

There are a lot of really creative ways people can captured notes, photos, resources, questions, and even write event publications. Do you have activities to help people do this? Or best practices on documentation at events? [Post an activity][1] on how to do this or [edit this wiki page here][2] where we're compiling these resources and add in your ideas!
