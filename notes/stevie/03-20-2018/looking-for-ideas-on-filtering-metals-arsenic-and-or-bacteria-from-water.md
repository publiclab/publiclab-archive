A friend just shared [an article with me about "Mesopaper.][1]" Evidently filter "uses three layers of paper made from bamboo fiber, with ceramic granules sandwiched between each layer; the granules, manufactured from clay, have tiny pores small enough to capture heavy metals like arsenic, lead, or mercury, while letting water through, along with nutrients like calcium and magnesium."

The article goes on to say "a six-pack is $6.99; one 9″ diameter sheet can filter about 22 liters or six gallons, depending on how contaminated the water is."

Has anyone ever worked with "Mesopaper" or have any ideas on this method of filtration?
