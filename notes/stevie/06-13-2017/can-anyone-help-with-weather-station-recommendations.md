Hi there, I'm posting on behalf of Groundwork New Orleans. Notes from them below:

"We are working with the Green Team to design, build and install solar powered charging benches to create more resilient communities in the face of climate change. The benches will collect usage data and climate data. The weather station will be separate but would **need to be solar powered as well. The students will be collecting the data so [we're] definitely [looking for] something user friendly.** Please let me know if you need any additional information."
