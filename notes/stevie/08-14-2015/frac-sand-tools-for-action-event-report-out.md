###Advocacy Strategies
We spent some time identifying what advocacy strategies have been successful facing the frac sand issue in the past, and ideas for new advocacy approaches in the future. working to strategize on the best approaches we should take, we voted to sort out how easy and effective each approach would be. Below is a table of what we came up with:

###Next steps identified from this event in moving forward include: 
####Follow up on Easy/Effective strategies
- @mathew and @donblair will continue their work on low cost dust and water sensors with the aim of: A dust sensor that can be used to raise awareness in the community and bring attention to the company for more over site. A water sensor that detects changes in turbidity or conductivity will be developed that will indicate when photos should be taken to record runoff events. 
- @gretchengehrke will look into making review papers that are easy to read, use and understand.
- @gretchengehrke and @pat will work with local officials to develop a protocol for collecting photographic data on runoff events which includes the information that needs to be gathered and who it should go to.
* @mathew will work with a Public Lab Organizer to develop a training or materials for people to gather existing aerial images of mining sites from open government databases. 
- @stevie will share out information on Public Lab's methods of aerial mapping with the Midwest google group.</br>
- @pat will continue her efforts in writing letters to legislators and town board members and everyone will encourage their constituents to do so. 
- Everyone will think further about the advocacy strategies outlined and those that could be added to this list and followed up on.
