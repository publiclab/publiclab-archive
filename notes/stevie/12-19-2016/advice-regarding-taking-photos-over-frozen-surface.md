###What I want to do or know
Experimenting with using a trail camera to capture photos of a wetland where a frac sand mine is going to be coming in. Looking for advice on taking photos over a frozen surface. Anyone have ideas on how best to do this? Has anyone handled glare, or frozen conditions or have ideas about it?
