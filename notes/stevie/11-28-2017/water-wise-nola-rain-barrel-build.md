_Sharing a note (and above image) from [Water Wise NOLA][1]::_

Water Wise NOLA is participating in the Big TREEsy Giveaway on Saturday, December 2!

Water Wise will be offering an abridged 15-minute version of its standard do-it-yourself [rain barrel build][2] _(Publication by Hilairie Schackai at Water Wise NOLA)_ workshop at Parks and Parkways for $25. Yes, the $25 includes the rain barrel! 

Its mini-tutorials will run every 30 minutes between 8:30 and 11:30 a.m.During this time, no power tools will be used. All barrel modifications will be precut. There will be no deep dives into rainwater harvesting. Instead, participants will simply be assembling their barrels from a “kit of parts”—and Water Wise will be sharing a few essential tips on how to install and maintain a rain barrel. 

Water Wise has ONLY 24 BARRELS available! So if you want to come to the workshop and build a rain barrel to take home, please register ASAP. This is a first-come first-serve opportunity. The first 24 people to register will receive a barrel at the workshop.

[Click here](http://bit.ly/rainbarrels_bigtreesy_dec2) to register for the mini rain barrel workshop tutorial. Only one rain barrel per household, please.

Registration closes on Wednesday, November 29, at 2 p.m.

For questions you may email Hilairie Schackai at hschackai@rechargenola.org. Please put "big treesy rain barrels" in the subject line.
