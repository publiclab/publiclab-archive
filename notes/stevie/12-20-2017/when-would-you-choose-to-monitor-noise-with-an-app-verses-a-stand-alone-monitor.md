I recently asked a question about [resources for monitoring noise pollution][1] and heard back from people about a number of [available apps][2], and a couple monitors (a [digital sound level meter][3] and the [softhook][4] Raspberry Pi sound-streaming device). I'm wondering

- What are situations when one might be better than the other? 
- How do their data compare? 

Other information on comparisons would be helpful as well.
