Public Lab will be hosting a get together for anyone interested in practicing a site survey and hotspot particulate matter sampling in New Auburn, WI on Friday March 31st. We’ll start with a breakfast-brainstorm and head out from there! 

###Who should come?
Anyone with a desire to explore frac sand mining, monitoring, photography or anyone just looking to meet up and spend some time hiking around the [New Auburn Recreation Area.](https://publiclab.org/questions/mathew/03-15-2017/can-the-new-auburn-wi-recreation-area-be-used-to-identify-downwind-dust-from-great-northern-sand)

###What will we do? 
We’ll meet for breakfast and spend some time planning out our photo survey, and hotspot monitoring. Then we’ll head outside and explore the Great Northern Frac Sand Mine in New Auburn from the nearby recreation area and publicly accessible roads. We’ll plan on doing a photo survey of the site and test out [hotspot monitoring techniques](https://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/04-06-2016/mapping-dust-hotspots-with-low-cost-monitors) using a low cost sampler [pDR-1500](https://publiclab.org/wiki/pdr-1500).

###Why are we doing this?
[Photo monitoring](https://publiclab.org/wiki/photo-monitoring) and sites surveys are a good way to scope out an environmental issue and question. Hotspot sampling can help to identify where pollution is highest and lowest around a site at a given time. This can be helpful for developing future monitoring strategies, and learning about how pollutants react to things like topography and weather in a local area. By refining these techniques we can both document the mine, and better understand how these methods (photo surveys and hotspot monitoring) can be used and refined to work in other places. 

###Where and when? 
We’ll meet Friday, March 31st at 10am at the Sunshine Cafe (151 E Main St, New Auburn, WI 54757). After breakfast and planning, we’ll head outside for the survey around 11. Join on for as long or short as you’d like! We’ll aim to wrap up by 3pm and stop for snacks and lunch as needed. (it could be challenging to meet up after the group has gone outside, but feel free to call to try to catch up: 603.273.7027) 

###What to bring: 
Your ideas and questions! Also, it will probably be on the colder side, and we’ll hopefully be spending a good bit of time outside hiking around. Bring warm clothes, and comfortable boots that will keep you warm and dry in the snow.
