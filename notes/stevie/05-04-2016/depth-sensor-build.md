Public Lab, IDIYA, and Water Works invite you to participate in a flood sensor build challenge!! 

Flood sensors could help New Orleans track where street flooding is occurring throughout the city. Join other concerned citizens, students, the maker community, technologists, and tinkerers who are coming together to explore building a solution to our city’s chronic street flooding. This multi­day event is free and open to the public.
