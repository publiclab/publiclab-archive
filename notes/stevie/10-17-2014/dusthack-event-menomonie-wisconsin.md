###Explore and experiment with dust monitoring tools! 

**When: Monday October 27th, 5:00-8:00**
**Where: The Hundredth Monkey Maker Space in Menomonie, Wisconsin. **

The tools used to explore dust and silica levels in air are prohibitively expensive for people and many require expensive lab tests for results. We're interested in exploring other monitoring methods that will reduce the cost of monitoring and increase people's assess to this important data! 

We'll have a [DustDuino](http://publiclab.org/wiki/dustduino), a spec. and a [Dylos](http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/06-12-2014/diy-dust-monitoring-dylos-in-wisconsin)! 

**Some of the questions we might explore include:** </br>
- How do tools such as the DustDuino work under different light conditions? </br>
- How does humidity affect these tools? </br>
- Is there stable housing we can use to prep tools for outdoor use? </br>
- How does sampling with the different tools compare? </br>
- How can we make these tools more user friendly?</br>
- How can we make the data more accessible? etc.
 
**Together, we will brainstorm how to make dust monitoring more accessible! **
