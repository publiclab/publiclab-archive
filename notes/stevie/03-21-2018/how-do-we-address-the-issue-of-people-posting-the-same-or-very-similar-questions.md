### Please describe the problem (or idea)

 I have found myself and others accidentally (or unknowingly) posting questions that are the same or very similar to those posted by other people. Here are a couple things I'm thinking about on this: 

- The simplicity of posting material as a question reduces the barriers people have in getting material out up, but does not prevent duplicates.
- I know I could have avoided this by searching through questions with the tags I was planning on using, but not everyone would know to do that.
- If similar questions are posted, the answers to those are stored in different places. 
- Sometimes, the different ways people ask questions are nuanced. Another way to think of it is that sometimes answers people post on one issue, apply to other questions asked.

Here's an example of somewhere that this has happened: 

- https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/01-09-2018/what-are-different-methods-of-measuring-water-turbidity
- https://publiclab.org/questions/stevie/03-21-2018/how-do-i-choose-a-method-for-monitoring-turbidity

_You can see how these are slightly different, but could have similar answers._ 

What are other things to consider on this issue? And what are ways we might work to address it?
