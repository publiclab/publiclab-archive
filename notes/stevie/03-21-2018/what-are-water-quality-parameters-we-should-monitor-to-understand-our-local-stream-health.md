I'm interested in learning more about what water quality parameters we should be looking into if we're interested in keeping an eye on the health of our local stream. 

- Are there standard parameters we should use?
- Are some parameters better indicators of health than others? 
- Are parameters universal or are there factors we should consider based on where we are or local pressures? 
- Where can we find more resources or materials on this topic?
