There has been a lot of information published on concerns related to radon in indoor air. I'm wondering why this is specific to indoor environments? 

  
One reason I'm interested is because there is a proposed quarry next to my house. We have high levels of radon in the groundwater already. If they are blasting and exposing this rock to air, should we be worried about radon in our outdoor air as well now too?
