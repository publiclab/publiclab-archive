##Hold the showers: 
April _pole mapping_ brings May... _wetland maps!_

**Where:** Meet us at Propeller </br>
**When:** Saturday, April 18th at 11am.  </br>
**Why:** We've been working on building a better pole for pole mapping. (Follow our work by clicking the polemapping tag, and others who have been on this quest as well!) </br>

At this event we will bring our new, improved pole into the field for testing, experimenting and mapping. Also, we'll have a sneak peek at a NEW pole that could be coming to the Public Lab store! Will it be as awesome as ours?! Lets find out. 

Plan on traveling to the [South Shore Marsh Restoration Site](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zAUs3DxxU-HU.kg6ZtKnDD4DY) and possibly revisit Bayou St. John's Scenic Urban Waterway with us. </br>

I'll bring the snacks, you bring your sneakers! Questions, ideas, comments? Email stevie@publiclab.org
