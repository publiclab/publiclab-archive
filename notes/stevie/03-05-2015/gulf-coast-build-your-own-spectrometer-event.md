####Public Lab and IDIYA are hosting a “Build your own spectrometer” event!

Colored light is given off from all materials and is often a blend of different colors. A spectrometer is a device which splits those colors apart, like a prism, and measures the strength of each color. Spectrometers can be useful in examining everything from the make up of your beer, to oil testing and food grade sampling. Spectrometers tend to have price tags in the thousands, far too expensive for most of us. However, at this event you will you will not only learn how to use a spectrometer, but make one yourself with a Public Lab Spectrometer Kit. 

We are offering attendees a discount on the Public Lab Spectrometer Kit. Sold online for $45 (plus shipping), we will offer the new kit for $35.
