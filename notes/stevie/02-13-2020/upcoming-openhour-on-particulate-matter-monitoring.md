Hello!

Public Lab will be hosting an [OpenHour](www.publiclab.org/openhour) on Particulate Matter monitoring Monday, March 2 at 1 pm ET/ 12 pm CT (see [your timezone here](https://everytimezone.com/s/1ae68ae2 "https://everytimezone.com/s/1ae68ae2")).

We'll explore advancements in sensor technology, and discuss reasons why community groups might [choose one method for monitoring over another ](https://publiclab.org/wiki/choosing-a-method-for-particulate-matter-monitoring) given their interests and goals. (We'll update this wiki with info from the call!)
