## Interested in microplastics? We're looking for you! 

There's a group based out of southern Wisconsin who is looking to start a project monitoring for microplastics.  They're interested in hearing about other people's experiences, talking about lessons learned, and best practices as they work on setting up a monitoring program. They will be working with BabyLegs, but other microplastic monitoring experiences and interests welcome! 

##Join us Thursday, July 2 
We have a zoom line set up for 6pm et/ 5 ct. Come listen and/or offer ideas!
