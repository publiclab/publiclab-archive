May 23rd, Public Lab is partnering up with the [Backyard Gardener's Network](http://backyardgardenersnetwork.org/) to do aerial mapping of Bayou Bienvenue! 

Backyard Gardener's Network is hosting their monthly Super Saturday on May 23rd from 2-5pm. Following this event, we will be traveling down to Bayou Bienvenue to map the waste water treatment outlet and the lookout off Florida Ave. 

Join Backyard Gardener's Network in this community celebration between 2-5pm, or simply meet us to come map Bayou Bienvenue at 4:30 (meeting at Guerrilla Garden, 600 Charbonnet Street). 

See you then!
