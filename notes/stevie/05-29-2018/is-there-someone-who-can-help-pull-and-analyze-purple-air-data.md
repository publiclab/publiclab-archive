Hi! 
There's a group in Mobile County Alabama who has been using the purple air monitors, but they haven't had the ability to go through the data to both pull it and look for trends.  I'm looking for anyone is interested in helping them out- review it and look for trends or interesting points.

I noticed @guolivar had a nice post on these monitors a while back. I've also been hearing interest on them from another group in Wisconsin. It would be great to learn more about them!
