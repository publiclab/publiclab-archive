Hi all! 
I've had a question recently from a friend in Mobile, AL who is working with someone experiencing an increase in exposure to dust from a nearby roadway. They are interested in collecting some visual data around accumulation of dust. I know a few people on here have explored sticky pads, observed accumulation of dust on glass and other materials. Is there anything specific you would recommend they use to observe this?
