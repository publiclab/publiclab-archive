#### What I want to do or know

We have been [using a few of these cameras](https://publiclab.org/wiki/timelapse) in the field to do environmental monitoring, but it seems a bit challenging to get them into the time-lapse mode instead of the motion detection mode. Has anyone done this? Can you provide some instructions?
