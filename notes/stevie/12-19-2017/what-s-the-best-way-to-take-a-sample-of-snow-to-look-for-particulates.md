With the new [basic microscope kit][1] in the works, I've been thinking of sampling methods that could be used to look at different materials. I'm particularly interested in imaging particulate matter samples. In the Midwest (WI, and IL mostly) there has been a [frack sand mining][2] boom in the past decade. The particulate matter that blows off these sites is a big concern. I'm wondering if there's a way to take a sample of snow and capture particulate matter imagery? I'm wondering:

What would be the best way to get a sample? 
What would the sample need to be stored in for melting and transport?
How do you turn that sample into something that can be viewed with the new microscope?
