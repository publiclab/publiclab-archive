_Community question from Jen Davis in Ontario_ 

My sister moved into a house a while back on the second floor. There is a sewage like smell that emits from the basement of the house that shows up intermittently, sometimes faint and sometimes very strong- we haven't noticed a pattern to it. It doesn't smell like rotten eggs, so we don't think it's sulfur, it smells distinctly like fences.  The house floods every 4-5 years and the landlord has refused to clean up the basement. My sister, and the family who lives below them, seem to be nose blind to the smell now, although myself, and other visitors to the house smell it.  

We haven't been able to get assistance moving from this apartment, and the landlord hasn't answered to our concerns about this smell.  There are small children who live here, and a young woman who is expecting. We're hoping to know more about what this smell might be, and any environmental/human health concerns around it. We think the smell might be hydrogen sulfide. We're also looking for any information sources we can bring to a judge to talk about the environmental health concerns around this to get the landlord to deal with this problem.
