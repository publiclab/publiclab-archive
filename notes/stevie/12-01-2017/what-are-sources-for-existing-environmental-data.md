I recently listened to a workshop by EPA on the ECHO database (Enforcement and Compliance History Online). This made me wonder about other existing sources of environmental data. 

- What are sources of existing environmental data?
- How do you know where to look for what?
- How do they compare: Are there some that are more accessible, accurate, or easy to use than others? 
- What are the gaps in available data?
