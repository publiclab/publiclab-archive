On the Live Call yesterday we were discussing the use of the [basic microscope](https://publiclab.org/wiki/basic-microscope) project to view particulate matter samples (the specific example we were talking about has to do with the [frac sand](http://www.publiclab.org/wiki/frac-sand) mining issue, and visualizing particulate matter coming from that industrial practice.)

On the call @Wicca posed the question of how these images would be useful for advocacy. I wanted to see if anyone else had ideas for this or comments on it. @kgradow1 and @dswenson both shared some ideas on the call.
