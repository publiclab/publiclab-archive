###What I want to do or know
My group is fighting an industry that's been a bane in our community's side for a long time. They are planning on growing and we have once chance to appeal this proposed growth. We have a lot of people against this and we're trying to figure out the best way to approach our public comment. We're mainly thinking about:

- With the bureaucratic system we're dealing with, what are the key points to focus on in the hearing?
- Should we all make the same key points, or task different individuals for making different points?
- Are there any good tips, things we should do, or things we should particularly avoid?
