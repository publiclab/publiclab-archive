###About the event:
In this workshop, participants will learn the basics of balloon and kite mapping to collect aerial images and build out maps. After meeting at Docville farm for an introduction to mapping, participants will travel to the St. Bernard Parish Wetlands Assimilation Project to learn about the project and map it together. We will then return to Docville Farm for lunch. After lunch we will collaboratively build out maps with the images collected that morning. Participants will learn about and use Public Labâ€™s free open source software called MapKnitter to stitch images taken from the morning flights into maps. Finally, we will brainstorm and discuss the uses of mapping in community science applications. 

Goals for workshop include:

- Cultivating community science thinking.
- Learning about low cost accessible monitoring techniques and practices.
- Connecting with broader community science practitioners across the Gulf of Mexico.
- Documenting environmental projects.
- Visualizing and communicate data on local environments.
