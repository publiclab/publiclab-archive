On April 23rd, Public Lab hosted the [Exploring Dust and Water Monitoring Tools Event](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/04-04-2016/event-in-eau-claire-wi) in Eau Claire, WI. This event was a follow up to the [Tools for Action](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/08-14-2015/frac-sand-tools-for-action-event-report-out) event back in August. 

During this event we reviewed the Advocacy strategies everyone identified from the previous event and updated them::

        <td>Effective</td>
        <td>Aerial images of changing landscape</td>
<td>A lot of work has been done on this by Hank of Concerned Chippewa Citizen. Interest now in: volumetric measurement, evaluation of Method 9 through images, use of thermal imagery to identify seeps and runoff areas.</td>

        <td>Effective</td>
       <td>Images of runoff in streams</td>
<td>Images from streams had been collected by Lee Boland who reported his images to the county who was then able to take action on the runoff violations. <td>

        <td id="td_id_6" class="td-class-6">Easy</td>

        <td>Multi-pronged approach- economic impacts of road use, impacts on tourism etc.</td>
<td>A good bit of support from the group. For example, Buffalo Co stopped a mine from coming in because of the impact on tourism. Also, now that facilities are shutting down, losing jobs.</td>

  <tr id="tr_id_6" class="tr-class-6">
        <td id="td_id_6" class="td-class-6">Medium </td>

        <td>Low cost monitors to engage the public and put pressure on the company for more oversight</td>
<td>People were less interested in the Passive PM monitoring for the work that would go into it and what the advocacy results they would see coming from it, though they encouraged students to take on the project and identifying hotspots would be helpful.</td>

**New Sections were added:**

- Interested in the low cost water sensing that involved Turbidity and photography. 
- EPA Method 9 monitoring for dust, was of high interest to the group as a new advocacy strategy.

**Deeper discussions were then hosted on:**

- [EPA Method 9](https://publiclab.org/wiki/visual-pm#Smoke+School+Certification)
- [Low cost dust sensing](https://publiclab.org/wiki/passive-pm)
- Low cost water sensing (checked out the [turbidity monitor](https://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/11-01-2015/turbidity-sensor-prototype)!!)
- Aerial photography and [photographic monitoring.](https://publiclab.org/wiki/frac-sand-action-oriented-resources#Photographic+Monitoring) 

**Other discussion topics:** 

- Concern around abandoned mines and whether or not mining companies will honor their reclamation plan, and whether or not the reclamation plans are sufficient. 
- Closing mines paying the taxes they have due.
