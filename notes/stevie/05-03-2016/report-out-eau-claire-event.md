On April 23rd, Public Lab hosted the [Exploring Dust and Water Monitoring Tools Event](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/04-04-2016/event-in-eau-claire-wi) in Eau Claire, WI. This event was a follow up to the [Tools for Action](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/08-14-2015/frac-sand-tools-for-action-event-report-out) event back in August. 

During this event we reviewed the Advocacy strategies everyone identified from the previous event and updated them::

        <td>Effective</td>
        <td>Aerial images of changing landscape</td>
<td>A lot of work has been done on this by Hank of Concerned Chippewa Citizen. Interest now in: volumetric measurement, evaluation of Method 9 through images, use of thermal imagery to identify seeps and runoff areas.</td>

        <td>Effective</td>
       <td>Images of runoff in streams</td>
<td>Images from streams had been collected by Lee Boland who reported his images to the county who was then able to take action on the runoff violations. <td>

        <td id="td_id_6" class="td-class-6">Easy</td>

        <td>Multi-pronged approach- economic impacts of road use, impacts on tourism etc.</td>
<td>A good bit of support from the group. For example, Buffalo Co stopped a mine from coming in because of the impact on tourism. Also, now that facilities are shutting down, losing jobs.</td>

  <tr id="tr_id_6" class="tr-class-6">
        <td id="td_id_6" class="td-class-6">Medium </td>

        <td>Low cost monitors to engage the public and put pressure on the company for more oversight</td>

**New Sections were added:**

- Interested in the low cost water sensing that involved Turbidity and photography. 
- EPA Method 9 monitoring for dust, was of high interest to the group as a new advocacy strategy.

**Deeper discussions were then hosted on:**

- [EPA Method 9](https://publiclab.org/wiki/visual-pm#Smoke+School+Certification)
- [Low cost dust sensing](https://publiclab.org/wiki/passive-pm)
- Low cost water sensing (checked out the [turbidity monitor](https://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/11-01-2015/turbidity-sensor-prototype)!!)
- Aerial photography and [photographic monitoring.](https://publiclab.org/wiki/frac-sand-action-oriented-resources#Photographic+Monitoring) 

**Other discussion topics:** 

- Concern around abandoned mines and whether or not mining companies will honor their reclamation plan, and whether or not the reclamation plans are sufficient. 
- Closing mines paying the taxes they have due.
