In November, 2019 the Orangetown Justice Court found API Industries, Inc. (Aluf Plastics) guilty of violating Orangetown Town Code with respect to odor emissions on five separate occasions in November and December 2018, yet in the days immediately following this conviction, the odors have intensified. The recognition of five odor occasions is a drop in the bucket. Since 2016, CA4O estimates that there have been over 1400 odor complaints from members of the community.

@CA4O is interested in hearing strategies for keeping people engaged on this issue. They are concerned that since there's been a ruling, people will move on from the issue, but the fight isn't over, and it's important to keep pressure and momentum on this issue.
