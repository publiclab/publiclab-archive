### What I want to do or know

Is it possible to log the data from a dustduino without a wifi network?

What is the approximate cost of a full unit?

How long(ish) do they take to assemble?

### Background story

I am trying to put together a small air quality monitoring project as part of a science outreach program, I am looking to buy a dozen PM2.5 sensors and place them round my local area, in gardens, parks ect and present the findings in a local science fair.

I am a scientist, with experience of using aerosol measurements, air quality modelling ect but little experience of taking measurements!

Thanks,
