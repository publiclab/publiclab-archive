We are working on a project with remote forest communities in Panama with the Almanaque Azul Foundation over there. We will be facilitating participatory mapping of their local forest reserves, and we will train local teams to keep collecting data and keeping their maps updated. So we will be testing Mapeo ([www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo/](http://www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo/)) for data collection and QGIS ([www.qgis.org](http://www.qgis.org)) as a general purpose desktop GIS application.

However QGIS is pretty full on in terms of features and user interface, and some of our community partners have limited experience with desktop computers. We would ideally like a (free) desktop GIS that has a user interface more like Mapeo (which is based on OSM's iD). Something that would allow people to load raster and vector layers and do basic styling at least, so they can quickly produce maps for print or display.

Does anyone have ideas on whether this exists or if folks might be interested in developing a custom UI for QGIS for participatory rural cartography?
