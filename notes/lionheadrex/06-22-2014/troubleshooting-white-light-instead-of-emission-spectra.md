###What I want to do
Fix my spectrometer (I only see a white light instead of an emission spectra)

###My attempt and results
Built it, observed no emission spectra and instead saw a bright white light; tried to block out light getting into the box, that did nothing; tried letting more light in the box (from the sides instead of the slit), strangely, that lets me see what looks like an emission spectra at an angle. 

###Questions and next steps
Why do I see a bright light?  Based on a question from Liz Barry in a google groups post I'm guessing I messed up the DVD insertion step, but I'm not sure what the next step is in fixing it.

###Why I'm interested
Because I want to fix my spectrometer.

###Other
You may notice in the image that my box looks like it can't completely close.  It doesn't (whoops).  It does get really close, and I wrap the fabric from a pair of heavy black jeans all the way around the box (except the opening where I want light to come in!), and it does seem to block all residual light.
