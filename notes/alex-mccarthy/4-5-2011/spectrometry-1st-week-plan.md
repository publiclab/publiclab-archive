1st week plan for research in low cost spectrometry for pollution detection

Build/Test:
•	Build a new spectroscope following current plans to better understand how to make the process more reproducible, easier.
o	Black PVC to reduce light interference in tube?
o	Control size of slit by using piece of paper to evenly space razor blades?
•	Design a standardized sample holder mounted to spectroscope for liquid samples
•	Test accuracy of spectrum by analyzing known spectrums: sunlight, printed color samples, dyes of known wavelengths
o	Try several cameras to see if discrepancies are originating from instrument or from cameras inability to take true color photos
o	Find actual color value of peaks on spectrograph; compare them to peaks in known spectrums.
•	Test dissolved oil of different concentrations, and relate intensities in spectrographs
Supplies: materials for new spectroscope (black PVC?), blank DVD

Goal: increase resolution of spectroscope
•	2 diffraction gratings? (Further spilt spectrum?)
•	DVD vs. CD? (DVDs have more grooves)

Research:
•	What PAHs specifically are typical of pollution in test location (gulf oil spill, Gowanus canal, ect)
•	Find spectrographs of these PAHs online, or from MIT
•	Obtain samples of these PAHs for testing?
•	What wavelength is the CD adsorbing?
•	Use spectroscope to analyze vegetation health?
•	Use spectroscope to find relative smog densities in cities?
•	Use spectroscope to find plankton density?
•	How useful is the sun as a reproducible light source for spectroscope?
o	Is direct light to bright? Use reflected, or filtered light to lessen intensity?
