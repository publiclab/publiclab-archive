Hello. I am actually doing a master in Barcelona of Design for the Emergent Futures. So I am going to the area of bioremediation with fungi mycoremediation system. Where I searching to remediate toxic with mycelium like the idea to create regenerative materials. So as a first step I train oyster mushroom to digest cigarette but form the street. Having a good result because the fungi break it down completely digesting it. But the problem is then when I want to prove that the fungi were able to transform the toxic of the cigarette butt in organic material I can't prove it with real data. So I am now struggling because they are some scientists that had told me that is impossible that the toxic are still there worst know in the mushroom infecting nature. But I see that they are other many scientists like you that have proved that fungi are able to bioremediate and transform toxic inorganic materials. 

  
Bioremediation its a real solution for toxic or waste? Can you help me how to prove the effectiveness? And if you can send me your experiment process it would be very useful for me. 

Thank you.
