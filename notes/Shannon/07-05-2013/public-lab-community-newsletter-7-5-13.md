This week in the Public Lab community newsletter, meet our new board member, take a second to support the Kickstarter, get ready for a barn raising in the wetlands of Louisiana and read about infrared imaging work being done at urban gardens, farms and landfills. Enjoy!

**Thank you and last day to support the Kickstarter!** Thanks to everyone who helped us meet, and exceed, the $65k stretch goal with the [Infragram Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/infragram-the-infrared-photography-project). We're excited to launch the Infrared Photography Project and are glad to see that there are over 1,500 others that are as well. The Kickstarter ends at 7am est tomorrow (Saturday) morning, so now is the time to get in last minute pledges. There is also an [Infrared Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plots-infrared) that you can get involved in to interact with others interested in near-infrared imaging.

**Welcoming a new board member.** We're happy to announce that Catherine Bracy, who runs [Code for America's international program](http://codeforamerica.org/international/), has joined the Public Lab board. Learn more about Catherine and other board members at [this page](http://publiclab.org/board). 

**Barn Raising 2013 save the date.** The Public Lab Gulf Coast group can't wait to welcome you all down bayou! We've settled on October 4-6, 2013 for the annual community Barn Raising in Cocodrie, Louisiana. More information coming soon, but in the meantime, read up on the [2012 gathering](http://publiclab.org/wiki/barnraising) or [watch the video](http://publiclab.org/notes/scaramel/6-13-2013/video-kitemappers) from Caterina Scaramelli. 

**Google Summer of Code update.** The first Google Summer of Code project updates are being posted and are available at: [http://publiclab.org/tag/gsoc](http://publiclab.org/tag/gsoc).

**Five Borough Farm, Saugus Landfill and Cloverleaf Farm project update.** Follow the Five Borough Farm project rolling out new tools for gardeners and farmers in NYC -- lots of [Infragram experiments](http://publiclab.org/tag/5BF) in the last week. Folks working around the [Saugus Landfill](http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-05-2013/saugus-landfill-overflight-photos-with-infragram) in Massachusetts and at [Cloverleaf Farm](http://publiclab.org/notes/gonzoearth/07-02-2013/multispectral-gopro-at-cloverleaf-farm) in Davis, CA also posted a couple of updates on infrared experiments. 

**Hackaday Infragram coverage and Maker Faire KC.** The Infragram was featured by Hackaday in an article titled _[Seeing plant health in infrared](http://hackaday.com/2013/07/03/seeing-plant-health-in-infrared/)_ and Public Lab participated in [Maker Faire Kansas City](http://www.makerfairekc.com/) where we [gave a talk](https://twitter.com/Shipleycom/status/351019674051428352/photo/1) alongside OpenROV and Makers Row. 

**Fireworks.** A couple of posts went around yesterday asking about using the Infragram or Spectrometer to look at fireworks. Did you? If so, please post a research note or [mail the Infrared or Spectrometer groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plots-infrared/3sDDuzuM26M) and share your experiment!

**Foldable Spectrometer news.** [New packaging](http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-05-2013/new-foldable-spectrometer-packaging) for foldable spectrometers is complete and they are also now available on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DSA70TS). 

**Growing fast.** Over 1300 people are now on the "publiclaboratory" mailing list, and almost a thousand on "grassrootsmapping" - you can follow their growth here: [http://publiclab.org/wiki/mailing-lists#Graphs](http://publiclab.org/wiki/mailing-lists#Graphs).

As always, if anything was missed, please email the lists, post a research note, or message shannon@publiclab.org for inclusion in the newsletter next week. Have a great weekend everyone! Shannon
