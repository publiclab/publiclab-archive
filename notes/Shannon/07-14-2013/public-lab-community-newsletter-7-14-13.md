In the Public Lab newsletter this week, listen to a story on challenging a nuclear power plant permit with kite imagery, sign-up for the 2013 barnraising, pre-order  an Infragram filter pack and check out new infrared photography and spectrometry projects being done by the community. Enjoy!

**Nuclear waste site permit challenged.** Using images collected via kite mapping, organizers are challenging a permit for new construction at the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Plant in Massachusetts. [Listen to the full story on WBUR](http://www.wbur.org/2013/07/10/pilgrim-nuclear-waste-permit).  

**New website launched.** Public Lab has done a complete transition to publiclab.org. Check out the [new site](http://publiclab.org/dashboard) and provide feedback or report issues to web@publiclab.org.

**Barnraising 2013 registration now open.** A [logistics page](http://publiclab.org/wiki/barnraising-2013) is up and [registration is now open](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FmmZFUUn2fOe-xI9-gtWdge8C-nXCTS9G0D977YOwAE/viewform), we're looking forward to welcoming you in Louisiana! If you're interested in helping to organize the barnraising, whether you plan on coming or not, please sign up for a committee on the barnraising page or email shannon@publiclab.org.

**Kickstarter wrap-up.** Thanks again to the 1,500+ backers who helped raise over $71,000 to launch the Infrared Photography Project! Here's an [update](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/infragram-the-infrared-photography-project/posts/535035) on what you can expect next if you were a backer.

**Infragram Filter Pack available for pre-order.** We've had many requests for filters now that the Kickstarter is over. You can pre-order yours [here](http://store.publiclab.org/collections/diy-infrared-photography/products/infragram-diy-filter-pack) with an estimated ship date of August 2013.

**Public Lab Affiliate Program.** Joining the [Public Lab affiliate program](http://publiclab.org/wiki/affiliates) is a great way to support the Public Lab non-profit, and earn some revenue yourself. We're looking for new Affiliates who would be interested in placing ads about Public Lab Kits on their own sites, and earning 5% of the revenue from click throughs. Contact retail@publiclab.org with questions. 

**Media mentions.** Limn, a popular audience journal in Science and Technology Studies, just released a new issue with an [article by Public Labbers](http://publiclab.org/notes/Sara/07-12-2013/limn-issue-with-article-on-public-lab). Kaya Simmons, a student at Northeastern University, has been working on developing the thermal fishing bob, check out an [interview with him about the project](http://publiclab.org/notes/Sara/07-11-2013/great-video-from-northeastern-university-about-kaya-simmons-and-his-work-with-public-lab).
