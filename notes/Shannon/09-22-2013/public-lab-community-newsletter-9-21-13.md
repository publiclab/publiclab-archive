This week in the Public Lab community newsletter, come visit Public Labbers at Maker Faire NYC (today!), read about a project aerial mapping in Louisiana and find out how you can support the Public Lab nonprofit. Enjoy!

**Public Lab at Maker Faire NYC.** For all our friends in NYC who are headed to Maker Faire today, stop by the [Public Lab booth and come to the Public Lab panel](http://makezine.com/2013/09/15/explore-grassroots-science-at-maker-faire-new-york/) starting at 3pm on the [Make: Live Stage](http://makerfaire.com/location/make-live-stage-a_zone-c/).

**Barnraising 2013.** Only two weeks away, registration is technically closed, but if you'd really like to come, we'd love to have you! More information on the barnraising [here](http://publiclab.org/wiki/barnraising-2013) and/or you can contact liz@publiclab.org with questions.
