In the newsletter this week, check out updates from Google Summer of Code projects, browse the work done on near-infrared imaging at LEAFFEST and get ready for the 2013 Public Lab Barnraising. Enjoy!

**Announcements**

[GSoC](https://groups.google.com/group/plots-gsoc) ends in 1 week -- soft “pencils down” tomorrow. More updates to come, but check out a post on the GSoC project to [find the closest matched spectra from the database](http://publiclab.org/notes/Sreyanth/09-14-2013/finding-closest-match-spectra-from-the-database-gsoc-final-post).

**Upcoming events **

Barnraising 2013: [Travel stipends](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/publiclaboratory/fj4W-ddDt6Y) are still available, make sure to [reserve a spot today](http://publiclab.org/wiki/barnraising-2013)! 

There is a Waag Society/Public Lab program in Amsterdam for infrared plant analysis and kite mapping this upcoming week, taught by Cindy Regalado and Jeff Warren -- get in touch on the plots-amsterdam@googlegroups.com list if you're interested in participating.

**New and ongoing projects**

LEAFFEST resulted in a lot of intense camera testing related to the Infragram project, and has yielded a variety of helpful research: [http://publiclab.org/tag/leaffest](http://publiclab.org/tag/leaffest)

The “Sky Camera” app developed by Mohit Meena is out for testing. Feedback can be provided (and is requested) on the plots-gsoc mailing list: [http://publiclab.org/wiki/sky-camera](http://publiclab.org/wiki/sky-camera) / [http://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc-2013](http://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc-2013)

Keep an eye on the new [Amsterdam wiki page](http://publiclab.org/wiki/amsterdam) created this past week to get an idea of Public Lab happenings in the region.
