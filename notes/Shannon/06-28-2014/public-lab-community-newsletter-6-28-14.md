This week in the Public Lab community newsletter, grab your copy of the “international” Grassroots Mapping Forum (GMF), contribute your thoughts on trash in the next edition of the GMF, check out project updates from coastal Maine to the Czech Republic and get ready for the first OpenHour, focused on aerial mapping. Enjoy!

**Announcements**

Edition 5 of the Grassroots Mapping Forum is now out! This publication focuses on “international” projects from across the globe and includes essays, photos and maps from Israel, Spain, Uganda, Belize and China. Pick up a copy by visiting the Public Lab store: [http://store.publiclab.org/collections/publications/products/grassroots-mapping-forum-issue-5-the-international-issue](http://store.publiclab.org/collections/publications/products/grassroots-mapping-forum-issue-5-the-international-issue ) 

Interested in writing an essay for the next Grassroots Mapping Forum? In the 6th edition of the Forum we will be examining trash. We make things, we discard things, we reuse some things. This Forum will be a place for anyone in the community to share their reflections and musings related to trash and waste. Read the call for submission [here](http://publiclab.org/notes/MollyDanielsson/06-23-2014/call-for-submissions-for-grassroots-mapping-forum-6-trash).
