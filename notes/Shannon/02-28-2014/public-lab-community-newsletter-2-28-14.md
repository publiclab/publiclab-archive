This week in the Public Lab community newsletter (hang in there, its a long one!), check out an opportunity to join the Public Lab nonprofit team, get involved in Google Summer of Code, hear about progress made at SNOWFEST in Vermont and much more. Enjoy!

**Announcements**

The Public Lab nonprofit is hiring! We’re looking for a dynamic person to join our team as [Outreach Manager](http://publiclab.org/notes/Shannon/02-24-2014/join-the-public-lab-nonprofit-team-job-posting-outreach-manager). We’re looking for someone who is enthusiastic about technology, environmental health and education, has experience doing community outreach, wants to travel and will be a great addition to our collaborative global community! Applications are due March 12th and questions can be sent to shannon@publiclab.org. This position is based in New Orleans, Louisiana. 

Public Lab has been accepted to Google Summer of Code 2014! Last summer we had three fantastic projects by students in the GSoC program: [http://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc-2013](http://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc-2013). Now’s the time to brainstorm some new projects: [http://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc-ideas](http://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc-ideas) -- join the discussion on the plots-gsoc list, which you can join on that page.

We are also looking for mentors for GSoC; please email jeff@publiclab.org if you're interested or would like to learn more. It's not a huge time commitment and it can result in some extremely helpful advances to some of our web tools. 

We’re happy to announce that the [Public Lab nonprofit has received support from the Rita Allen Foundation and the Betsy and Jesse Fink Foundation](http://publiclab.org/notes/Shannon/02-27-2014/public-lab-receives-support-from-the-rita-allen-foundation-and-the-betsy-and-jesse-fink-foundation) to expand the incredible work happening in the Northeast region of the United States!
