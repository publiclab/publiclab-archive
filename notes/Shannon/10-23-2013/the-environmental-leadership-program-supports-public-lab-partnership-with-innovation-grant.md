# The Environmental Leadership Program Supports Public Lab Partnership with Innovation Grant

Thanks to the generosity of the [Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation](http://www.grdodge.org/about-us/), the [Environmental Leadership Program](http://elpnet.org/what-we-do) (ELP) has awarded an Innovation Grant to Public Lab, [Ironbound Community Corporation](http://ironboundcc.org/) and Phil Silva of [Cornell Civic Ecology Lab](http://civicecology.org/) for a project called _Building a model for community garden management through innovative action, monitoring and evaluation._

The Environmental Leadership Program supports a network of over 500 emerging and established environmental leaders through a fellowship program based on visionary, action-oriented and diverse leadership. The innovation grant went to a collaborative partnership established between ELP Senior Fellows Phil Silva (Cornell), Ana Baptista, Cynthia Mellon (Ironbound) and current New England Regional Network Fellow Shannon Dosemagen (Public Lab). 

**Project Scope**

This project will create a test case for adaptive co-management in an environmental justice community in Newark, New Jersey, using a suite of tools and methods for environmental monitoring developed by the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (Public Lab). The result of this project will be to create a case study that will inform management practices at the Ironbound Community Corporation urban garden and will be replicable for other urban gardeners to use at their sites. Public Lab will incorporate the use of near-infrared imaging techniques, including pole photography and aerial mapping - where tethered kites or balloons with infrared and visible light cameras attached, are sent overhead to take images of garden plots. Near-infrared imaging will give community members and volunteers the ability to monitor plant health in the garden and make management decisions based on the data collected. By the end of the project, participants will be able to use online, open source, stitching software, MapKnitter.org, to create multiple image maps of the garden site. The outcomes of this participatory action research project - a detailed case study and a urban gardening toolkit - will be shared with a national audience, offering insight and inspiration for similar efforts to use adaptive co-management in urban environmental stewardship work.
