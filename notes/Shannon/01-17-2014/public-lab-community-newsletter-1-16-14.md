This week in the Public Lab community newsletter, learn more about the launch of the Homebrew Sensing Project, join a new mailing list for Public Lab Los Angeles and get ready for Toolshed Raising part 2 in Boston. Enjoy!

**Announcements**

We’re happy to announce a [partnership with Ioby](http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-15-2014/announcing-an-ioby-public-lab-partnership) to crowdfund local community projects! Featured this week is the [Refinery Flare Monitoring project](https://www.ioby.org/project/refinery-flare-monitoring) by Dan Beavers. This exciting proposal seeks to develop and install a series of prototype 24-hour monitoring stations based on the Public Lab spectrometry kit to attempt to identify contaminants such as heavy metals in gas refinery flares.

If you missed the news earlier this week, we’re happy to announce that Public Lab received a Knight Foundation, Knight News Challenge: Health grant for the [Homebrew Sensing Project](http://publiclab.org/notes/Shannon/01-14-2014/public-lab-launches-new-initiative-to-affordably-detect-pollutants-with-open-hardware-tools).

If you’re in or around Los Angeles, or just love the city, there is a new mailing list specifically for you! Join here: [http://publiclab.org/wiki/los-angeles](http://publiclab.org/wiki/los-angeles)
