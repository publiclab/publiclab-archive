This week in the Public Lab community newsletter, check out holiday specials on kits, read about water-based mapping work being done and catch up on the smartphone "backpack" spectrometer project. Enjoy!

**Announcements**

[Hack your holidays with Public Lab!](http://publiclab.org/notes/liz/11-14-2013/hack-your-holidays-with-public-lab) During the holiday season, enjoy $5 Public Lab intro kits that you can try out with some of the winter ideas suggested by the community. If you're not sure what the DIY science enthusiast in your life wants this holiday season, one of the new [Public Lab gift cards](http://store.publiclab.org/collections/gifts-donations/products/gift-card) might be a perfect choice!

Catch up on the progress that has been made with the smartphone spectrometer in a [Kickstarter update](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jywarren/public-lab-diy-spectrometry-kit/posts/663898) posted yesterday. You can now [pre-order yours](http://store.publiclab.org/collections/spectrometry/products/smartphone-spectrometer), ready to ship before the holidays.

Pre-orders are also now available for the [Infragram webcam](http://store.publiclab.org/collections/diy-infrared-photography/products/infragram-webcam), shipping in January.

A new wiki page showing [how to post a Public Lab event](http://publiclab.org/wiki/post-an-event) was added.
