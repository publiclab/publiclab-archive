Public Lab and the
UC Davis Center for Community and Citizen Science are happy to announce a
recent partnership with support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The
two-year project launched in December 2016\. 

The central
questions that this project seeks to answer are whether and how doing community
science can support deeper involvement in civic participation and democracy.
This is an opportunity to understand the experiences of individuals and groups,
working together both in-person and online, to address environmental challenges
that affect people. The team will examine what forms of environmental community
science methods, contextualization, and support may engender increased
confidence in scientific concepts, and increased civic engagement.

This project will
address the following questions:

1\.
Under
what conditions, and through what mechanisms, can engagement in science lead
individuals and community groups to become involved in larger social or
environmental issues and civic actions?

2\.
What
aspects of the Public Lab model are replicable and transferable, and what
audiences are most appropriate to reach with this model?

We hope that
insights from this project can demonstrate a methodology that can be applied
across different audiences and contexts. This project will focus on adult
participation, but the team will use results of the research to begin
strategizing resources aimed at K-12 audiences, and will explore the influences
of formal and informal learning structures and opportunities for current and
future civic and scientific engagement.
