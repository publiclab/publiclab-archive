**National Academies' Gulf Research Program Awards $3.2 Million in Capacity-Building Grants to Benefit Coastal 
 Communities**

WASHINGTON -- The Gulf Research Program of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine announced today the recipients of 12 capacity-building grants, totaling almost $3.2 million. These competitive grants support community organizations as they conduct science-based projects designed to benefit their coastal communities from the Gulf of Mexico to Maine to Alaska.

The projects will use a variety of different approaches to address challenges faced by coastal communities. Some of the projects will focus on training residents in coastal communities to participate in citizen science and environmental monitoring projects in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas. Others will create and deliver educational programming, resources, and tools designed to help communities build resilience in the face of disasters, coastal flooding, and climate change.

Approaches range from building capacity for more disaster-related trauma and mental health services in southwestern Alabama to working with communities to build their resilience to the environmental and economic effects of disasters and environmental change along the Gulf, East, and Alaskan Coasts.

The projects pair scientists and other experts with community leaders to encourage information-sharing and foster community sustainability. In many cases, awardees plan to share the tools and approaches they develop to benefit others locally, regionally, and nationally.

> "The Gulf Research Program is committed to investing in community-based organizations that have strong ties to the people they serve," said Maggie Walser, director of education and capacity building. "One of the program's priorities is supporting science that benefits coastal communities and helps them prepare for future health and environmental challenges. This broad suite of new projects aims to do just that -- while also strengthening organizations that play a central role in connecting people with the services, resources, and science-based information they need."

The capacity-building projects were selected after an external peer-review process. More information about the award recipients and their projects can be found at [http://www.national-academies.org/gulf/grants/funded-projects](http://www.national-academies.org/gulf/grants/funded-projects).

The National Academies' Gulf Research Program was established in 2013 as a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It seeks to improve understanding of the interconnected human, environmental, and energy systems of the Gulf of Mexico and other U.S. coastal areas. The program funds studies, projects, and other activities using three broad approaches: research
and development, education and training, and environmental monitoring. To learn more about the Gulf Research Program, including grants and other funding opportunities, visit [http://www.national-academies.org/gulf](http://www.national-academies.org/gulf).

The National Academies are private, nonprofit institutions that provide independent, objective analysis and advice to the nation to solve complex problems and inform public policy decisions related to science, technology, and medicine. They operate under an 1863 congressional charter to the National Academy of Sciences, signed by President Lincoln.
