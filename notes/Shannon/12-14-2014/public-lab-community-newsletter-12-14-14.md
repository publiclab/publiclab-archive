This week in the Public Lab community newsletter, read an article from ProPublica on mapping land loss in Louisiana, take a look at the new foldable spectrometer design and check out the MultispeQ beta, coming soon. Enjoy!

**Announcements**

The Public Lab Cambridge/Somerville holiday party was a big success! We had 30+ people attend for a combined open shop and tool intros plus 15-20 who stayed for festivities. Coqui and spectrometer demos, intro to local mapping initiatives, plus lots of tasty food, good company and general hanging out and merriment, made for a great gathering!
