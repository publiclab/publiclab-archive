OpenHour Monday, July 14 at 8pm est: Spectral Analysis During this OpenHour we will be discussing spectral analysis: How can it be used? Where can the science of spectrometry take us in the future? [Jeff Warren](http://publiclab.org/profile/warren), Public Lab Research Director, will be discussing spectrometry and its applications for oil sampling and [Amy Soyka](http://publiclab.org/profile/amysoyka) will discuss color theory, and her project to test dust and water samples from the Latrobe Valley following a mine fire. Bring your research, your ideas, and your questions and join us for [OpenHour](https://plus.google.com/events/cp03t0jqgptuvaseuvts7p3h4q0)!
