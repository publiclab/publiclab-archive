In the Public Lab community newsletter this week, get updates on projects happening from Spain to Louisiana, dig in to a conversation on indoor gardening and open hardware and check out numerous new research notes on topics ranging from underwater plume sampling to Arduino based underwater sensor platforms. Enjoy!

**Announcements**

Anyone in the Austin, Texas area? We’ll be organizing a Public Lab meet-up between the dates of 3/7-3/11. If you’re in the area and interested in meeting other Public Labbers or have ideas about where we can meet/map/enjoy some time away from SXSW, please send a message to shannon@publiclab.org.

The Citizen Science Association (CSA), has just launched and is pleased to announce free, inaugural membership: [CitizenScienceAssociation.org/membership](CitizenScienceAssociation.org/membership)

**Upcoming events**

The Citizen Cyberscience Summit is this week in London! [Check out the schedule](http://lanyrd.com/2014/citizen-cyberscience-summit/schedule/) for talks and workshops by Public Lab organizers including Cindy Regalado and Hagit Keysar.

Although Ignite Philly appears to currently be sold out, for those in Philadelphia, here’s an upcoming event where Public Labbers will be giving a talk on balloon mapping in the Philly region: [http://publiclab.org/notes/SeanKMcGinnis/02-13-2014/ignite-philly-13](http://publiclab.org/notes/SeanKMcGinnis/02-13-2014/ignite-philly-13 ) 

**New and ongoing projects**

Mapping of Barataria Bay in Louisiana is underway. With the [generous support of Patagonia Clothing Company](http://publiclab.org/notes/Shannon/09-20-2013/patagonia-clothing-company-supports-gulf-coast-mapping-of-barataria-bay), Public Labbers are taking to the water and mapping at twenty sites around the area. Read more about the February 9th mapping trip here: [http://publiclab.org/notes/eustatic/02-12-2014/barataria-2014-february-9th](http://publiclab.org/notes/eustatic/02-12-2014/barataria-2014-february-9th) 

Interested in indoor gardening? Here’s a new project to examine concepts in open hardware tools for indoor gardening: [http://publiclab.org/wiki/new-concepts-for-oshw-in-indoor-gardening](http://publiclab.org/wiki/new-concepts-for-oshw-in-indoor-gardening) 

Check out a research note by Public Lab organizer, Scott Eustis, on mapping urban flooding in New Orleans: [http://publiclab.org/notes/eustatic/02-11-2014/new-orleans-city-park-stormwater-wetland](http://publiclab.org/notes/eustatic/02-11-2014/new-orleans-city-park-stormwater-wetland) 

Here’s a wrap-up from Public Lab mappers in Castelleon, Spain who completed a three-day workshop earlier this month: [http://publiclab.org/notes/pablo/02-12-2014/mapping-with-balloons-in-castellon-and-building-community](http://publiclab.org/notes/pablo/02-12-2014/mapping-with-balloons-in-castellon-and-building-community).
