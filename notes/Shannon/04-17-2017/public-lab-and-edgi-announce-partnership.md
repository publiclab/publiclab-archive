**Public Lab and Environmental Governance and Data Initiative partner under a fiscal sponsorship and commitment to open environmental data**

Public Lab and the Environmental Governance and Data Initiative (EDGI) are happy to announce that Public Lab will act as fiscal sponsor to EDGI in support of their mission to leverage research and online tools to monitor, document and respond to the attempts of undermining evidence-based environmental governance.

The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) and Public Lab have shared values of responsible environmental management and governance, public accessibility of data, and public engagement in environmental decision-making. EDGI is working to preserve vulnerable data and information that is at risk of being removed or restricted from the public eye, and making that data available to the public at large. EDGI is also committed to monitoring and reporting on any changes to federal environmental policy, sense of mission, funding, capacity, and website content. By documenting and making this information available to the public, EDGI seeks to enhance federal environmental accountability and foster responsible environmental management and governance. EDGI seeks to maintain and heighten public access to open data.

EDGI provides services that will help inform Public Lab's work, as EDGI will keep a keen eye on the changing regulatory landscape of oil and gas regulation, environmental justice, the clean water act, and many others. Effective community science efforts will need to stay abreast of these changes so that community expectations are in line with governmental capacity and legal duty. A map of reductions to federal environmental data collection and governance is also an opportunity to map how citizen science data collection and civic engagement might be leveraged to most efficiently protect endangered communities and natural resources.

EDGI licenses all materials produced with an open license (CC-BY-SA 4.0) and is committed to large-scale public dissemination of findings -- including both published and informal late-breaking findings. The EDGI multi-modal (website, twitter, blog, op-eds, white papers, 100 days report, over 30 (to-date) archive-a-thons across North America) outreach strategy holds the circulation of information on environmental data and governance to be a top priority.

Questions about this sponsorship can be directed to Shannon Dosemagen, Public Lab Executive Director ([shannon@publiclab.org](mailto:shannon@publiclab.org)) and Nick Shapiro ([shapiro.nick@gmail.com](mailto:shapiro.nick@gmail.com)) of EDGI.
