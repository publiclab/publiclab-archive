# Public Lab community newsletter 4.14.13

After wrapping up another great week, we're excited to hear from people about future needs for map annotating, view the entries coming in for Spectral Challenge and read about mapping projects in Brazil, Nicaragua and Panama. Enjoy!

Map annotation survey. Public Lab has been building the ability to annotate maps into [MapKnitter.org](https://mapknitter.org/). Currently, you are able to embed a photo or video, add points and create closed and colored shapes. As we further develop the functionality, we'd appreciate your feedback on ways that you would use annotations in your work. You can fill out the seven question survey by visiting the [Public Lab website](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/Shannon/04-11-2013/public-lab-map-annotation-survey). 

Grassroots Mapping Forum Issue Three: Organizing. The new issue of the [Grassroots Mapping Forum](http://publiclaboratory.org/forum) is hot off the press! Read an article from Hagit Keysar on Grassroots Mapping Jerusalem, an interview with Cindy Regalado of the University College London ExCiteS program and check out a full color map of Occupy UC-Davis. 

Spectral Challenge. The [Spectral Challenge](http://spectralchallenge.org/) is close to a month from the end of Stage 1. Read more about entering and supporting to get involved. 

Wired UK feature on balloon mapping. A quick [article on Public Lab aerial mapping](http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2013/03/how-to/how-to-make-balloon-maps) from the print March 2013 issue of Wired UK. For more detailed instructions, check out the [aerial mapping page](http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/balloon-mapping) that includes a material list, tutorials and a pre and post flight checklist. 

Youth led digital mapping in Brazil. Check out the [new note](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/ives/4-10-2013/cedaps-realiza-oficina-de-mapeamento-em-eus-bio-cear) on an event to train sixty people to work with youth to identify sites of environmental risk in their communities and map them with new technologies, including Public Lab aerial mapping. 

Boulder staff meeting. Public Lab staff completed the annual Spring meeting this past week in Boulder, Colorado. Time was spent discussing the new website, upcoming near-infrared Kickstarter and barn raisings during 2013. We're looking forward to sharing plans and incorporating suggestions from the community in the near future.
