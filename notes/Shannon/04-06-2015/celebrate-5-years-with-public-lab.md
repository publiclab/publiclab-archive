# Celebrate 5 years with Public Lab!

Five years ago this month, I was working in New Orleans with the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an organization that acts as a watchdog towards the oil and gas industry in Louisiana. April 20th of 2010 marked a turning point in my life, and the lives of many others, as we rapidly had to figure out how to address the largest oil disaster in U.S. history. The end of April 2010 also marked an opportunity for me to meet several of the other soon-to-be co-founders of Public Lab -- Jeff Warren, Stewart Long and Adam Griffith -- and launch a large-scale project to spur community engagement by mapping the oil disaster from the ground up. 

Well, we all know what became of that project. The Public Lab nonprofit is taking April 6 through May 6 (the day the first aerial map of the BP disaster was completed) to reflect on the event that prompted our community science movement to be born and to celebrate the work and progress of the Public Lab community in making science accessible, affordable and engaging.

In honor of our 5th anniversary, our goal is to raise $1,500 through our [Sustaining Member program](https://secure.lglforms.com/form_engine/s/x6zFryMJIAhNZ1bC56XAgw) between today and May 6. These funds help us keep the lights on and servers running and support our core effort of working with communities on innovative solutions to environmental problems. As a THANK YOU to everyone who contributes, we’re offering $5 off all memberships during the campaign, so there’s no better time to get that great [Public Lab t-shirt](http://publiclab.org/notes/Becki/11-25-2014/sustaining-member-t-shirts-are-in) you were eyeing.

Thanks again for your past support and your future consideration. I’m looking forward to the next five years! Shannon
