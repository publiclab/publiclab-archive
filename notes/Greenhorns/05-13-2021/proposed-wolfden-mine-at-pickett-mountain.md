# Proposed Wolfden Mine at Pickett Mountain

### A Canadian mining company, Wolfden Resources Corporation, has proposed a polymetallic mining operation on 6800 acres near Pickett Mountain. They claim that they will safely mine the area for Zinc, Lead, Copper, Silver and Gold. The state has yet to grant Wolfden's rezoning request, but local opposition is already building around fears of groundwater contamination.   

  
While the company claims that its mining methods are safe, experience has shown how rarely miners can extract their minerals without negatively impacting the local environment.   

We are interested in developing methods for studying the water quality in the area surrounding the proposed mine. Should the mine be approved, we want to be able to document how local water quality is affected by the mining operation. We are seeking advice and suggestions from other activists and citizen-scientists who have experience studying the impacts of mining on water quality.
