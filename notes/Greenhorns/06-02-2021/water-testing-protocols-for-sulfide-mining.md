We're looking to offer free water testing for community members near a proposed polymetallic sulfide mine. According to my research, we should be worried about the mine's impact on concentrations of lead, copper, zinc, arsenic, and cadmium, as well as how the possible leakage of sulfuric acid effects water pH. 

  
Does anyone have any other experience with this type of mining, or know of other people or organizations who might help us refine or expand our focus. Water testing is very expensive so we'd like to not be testing for anything superfluous.

  
thanks!
