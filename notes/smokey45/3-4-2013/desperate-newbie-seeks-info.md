Hi folks,
I'm just going to put this out there. I am an artist and new to this website. So I feel way out of my league. However, I am interested in detecting pollution in water for an upcoming project. To get me started, I want to know if I can use the Spectrometry Kit to say measure the stuff in ground water near my house AND will the posting of this information allow a newbie like me to see what is in the water? For example, if I take the image of the water and post it to the site where you all are sharing the data, how will I know what the image means? I hope I am not insulting all of you with my lack of knowledge but I just can't seem to answer my own questions after days of looking at this site. Btw, I LOVE the idea that someone is working on reading the prime point for Kambuchi. 
cheers,
Smokey
