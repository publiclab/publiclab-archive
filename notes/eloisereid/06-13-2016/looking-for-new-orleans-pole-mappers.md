Looking for New Orleans Pole Mappers

Next Week: Tuesday, June 14th, Wednesday the 15th and Thursday 16th I am looking for people who are interested in volunteering with my summer camp class in Gentilly.

We are generally learning about environmental justice and climate change in New Orleans and next week are going to start some Pole Mapping.

Tuesday, we are building our camera rigs so if you want to come help out and have cameras to donate for around 10-20 rigs that would be awesome!

Wednesday, we are going to attempt to attach the camera rig to the bamboo pole and start our first attempt at mapping on the Arthur Ashe campus.

Thursday, we are going out on campus another time and hopefully getting any kinks we run into smoothed out.

Friday, we are going to take a field trip, to either the lake or Bayou St. John and map around there!

Are you interested? Can you help? I am going to attempt my first pole mapping project this weekend and then teach it to children next week.

Email or call me or respond here eloisereid@gmail.com, 8027937704

Thanks!
