###What I want to do-Improve the water quality of Flushing Bay, Queens, New York

###My attempt and results- With the Water Trail Association and The River Project as parent organizations we have been taking samples and analyzing the quality of the water in Flushing Bay for the past 2 years. The water contains high levels of bacteria due to the 2 large CSOs which dump raw sewage into the Bay during rainfalls.

###Questions and next steps-We are having a shoreline Friends and Family Day on May 10th from 11am-3pm.  Please join us!  

###Why I'm interested- The Empire Dragon Boat Team, of which I am a member, practices on Flushing Bay 5 hours per week.
