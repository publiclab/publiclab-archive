I am in need of a thermal camera that isnt $$$$  and can be mounted on a UAV and have video (NTSC) output for FPV flying  . I have only found 2 that are close to my price range. If anyone has an opinion or knows where else I can look please let me know. Thanks so much! These are the ones so far.

the groupgets also says they have a private campaign that has these other ones for $2000

If you know anyone who has one let me know I want some personal experience from someone before I buy.
Thanks
