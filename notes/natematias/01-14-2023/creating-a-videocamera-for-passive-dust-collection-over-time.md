Hi everyone,

  
I'm wondering if anyone has advice or pointers on acquiring or creating a device that can record passive dust collection over time while I am riding by bicycle, maybe on a reel of some kind?  I'm very grateful to the community for [this guide on passive dust collection][1].
  
Context: I'm organizing a bike tour through the San Joaquin Valley in California. If it all comes together, we will be doing some storytelling and mediamaking about environmental justice questions, including air quality. 

  
I'm interested to bring along a device that does passive collection particulate matter along the way. In the ideal case, it would be possible to identify roughly when we encountered the particles.  The system does not need to correlate closely to other monitoring technologies, though it would be nice if it were internally consistent with its own observations, controlling for bicycle speed.
  
Is anyone aware of a system or design for a passive particle collector that can record particles onto a reel, and is reliable/small enough to bring on a 700+ mile bicycle ride? If I need to do it on a DIY basis, I've been thinking about [speed-modding a cassette player][2] to make it **very** slow, cutting open an aperture in the side of the case, and adding sticky tape reels instead of a cassette. I would then point the aperture forward when riding the bicycle. 

But if someone else has already solved this, I would love to hear ideas!

Note: I am a social scientist who knows a lot about statistics & code, and a few things about air pollution. I can fumble around electronics well enough to mod a system, but not really design or create something new from scratch.
