# About Public Lab

Public Lab is a community, supported by a non-profit, that develops and applies open-source tools to environmental exploration and investigation. By democratizing inexpensive and accessible do-it-yourself techniques, Public Lab creates a collaborative network of practitioners who actively reimagine the human relationship with the environment.

#### About This Role

Join our team and work to bring about a healthier and more equitable world through community science, open technology, and the pursuit of environmental justice.

This position is ideal for an early career evaluator and/or researcher who wants to be part of a fast-moving team that is developing, advancing, and sharing community science practices around the world. It's a role for someone who is driven to question the results---whether intended or unintended---of strategy and tactics, as well as develop tools that make visible the culture in which program delivery occurs.

The Organizational Learning Associate is part of Public Lab's Organizing & Research team, which ensures that people who come to Public Lab in pursuit of environmental justice are able to connect with others online and/or in-person to achieve locally meaningful outcomes. The Organizational Learning Associate will anchor evaluation and organizational learning processes to assess the impact, both planned and unplanned, of Public Lab programming and culture. The Organizational Learning Associate integrates learning practices and insights across all teams to speed the emergence of collective intelligence. Critically, the Organizational Learning Associate will be an integral part of navigating the cultural challenges of equitable knowledge production and exchange on projects happening in and adjacent to Public Lab. To do this work, the Organizational Learning Associate will disrupt the researcher/subject relationship in favor of collaboration and mutually beneficial and relational discourse, and from this relational position, anchor the design and generation of the varieties of data needed to document the scope and nature of the impact of Public Lab's model.

- Testing and implementing additional appropriate means for seeking and transmitting feedback throughout the Public Lab ecosystem and the broader movement. Encouraging a culture of feedback and short feedback loops
- Analyzing results
- Presenting results and insights publicly, and in greater detail to internal teams
- Supporting program teams to incorporate their own organizational learning and feedback practices and to implement what they learn
- Supporting the sustainability of community projects through grant writing and other fundraising initiatives
- Supporting the writing of white papers on project methodology
- Supporting the writing of peer-reviewed articles on community science

#### Experience and Training:

- **Trained in program evaluation** including design, and interviewing and analysis methods.
