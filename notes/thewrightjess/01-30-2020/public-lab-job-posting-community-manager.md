# About Public Lab

Public Lab is a community, supported by a non-profit, that develops and applies open-source tools to environmental exploration and investigation. By democratizing inexpensive and accessible do-it-yourself techniques, Public Lab creates a collaborative network of practitioners who actively reimagine the human relationship with the environment.

#### About This Role

Join our team and work to bring about a healthier and more equitable world through community science, open technology, and the pursuit of environmental justice.

This position is ideal for a mid-career organizer who wants to be part of a fast-moving team developing, advancing and sharing community science practices around the world. It's a role for someone with heart, who will elevate and center frontline communities in Public Lab's network, and build lasting relationships.

The Community Manager is part of Public Lab's Organizing & Research team, which ensures that people who come to Public Lab in pursuit of environmental justice are able to connect with others online and/or in-person to achieve locally meaningful outcomes. The Community Manager will seek out and learn from case studies around the world where community research led to victories over environmental injustices. The Community Manager facilitates high-level collaboration among people facing similar issues in different locations, from diverse backgrounds, and with varying expertise. The Community Manager fosters relationships among people navigating challenging environmental concerns, growing a research community.

The Community Manager will work to ensure the Public Lab strategic objectives for growth in frontline community engagement and diverse community development are met. The Community Manager will work to improve the community science process at critical moments: when community-generated problem statements are used to shape contributions by distributed collaborators, when critiques are incorporated, and when stories of impact are told. The Community Manager will become proficient in assembling and deploying environmental monitoring equipment, and in the collection and handling of data for use in local advocacy campaigns. The Community Manager oversees the regularly scheduled weekly, monthly, and annual public activities offered by Public Lab's Organizing & Research team.
