Hydrogen flames are generally colorless.  Very little emission is within range of visible light. Oxyhydrogen flames of gas produced by a common duct reactor are brightly luminous.  Conventional rationale says that there should be no difference, yet people who have seen this flame say it looks very different. So lets get a spectroscopic plot of the light from the flame. As far as I know nobody has ever done this.

In the above monograph,  eight tests of the effect of oxyhydrogen gas were conducted on Diesel engine efficiency in dynamometer labs. Results varied widely. There is no clear reason why this should be.  Perhaps flame spectroscopic data could be used as a variable to normalize these results. 

This technology could increase efficiency of Diesels on ships, trucks and locomotives reducing green house gas emissions by millions of metric tons but it needs to be better validated. For proposals on further research [click here](http://www.hho-research.org)
