hi all,

  
I am using pictures taking with a camera modified with infragram's NDVI lense (red filter I think) to derive NDVI as: (R-B)/(R+B). I'd like to know if I can calculate the average NDVI in a picture, or a selected area in a picture using infragram's sandbox. Should use a different software for that?
