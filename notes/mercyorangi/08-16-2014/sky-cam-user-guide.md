##2. Photo Acquisition Mission

###Starting and ending a photo acquisition mission
1. Buy a kite or a balloon or a drone - provides low cost, easy to use and safe methods for capturing aerial images.

2. Attach an Android phone, having the Sky Cam Application, to the kite/balloon/drone (as opposed to needing airplanes and/or satellites).

3. Build a simple ‘housing’ for your phone using a plastic bottle or an equivalent; to prevent against large dust pebbles or direct sunlight or rain drizzles (ensure the camera’s view is not obstructed by the housing).

4. Find an area to map; should meet regulations defined at balloon mapping regulations (See "Processing Aerial Photos" below).

5. Now, launch the Sky Cam application on the phone, lift your balloon, kite or drone and fly!

6. Sort your images stored in the phone’s SD card under a folder named “SkyCamFolder" or as sent to the email ID provided in the settings.

##4. Sky Cam Settings in detail

1. Time period - this is the time interval the camera will take to capture successive photographs.

2. Email ID - the email address where the photos taken (and metadata i.e. latitude and longitude) will be emailed to.

3. Exposure Value - ensures that the subject of the photo is at the center of the light scale (optional).

4. Threshold Value - this makes it possible to highlight objects in an image through the separation of light and dark regions.
