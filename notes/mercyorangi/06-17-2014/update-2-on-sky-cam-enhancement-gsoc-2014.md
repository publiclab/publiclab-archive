###Streaming photos to a 2nd mobile device
For the past 10 days, I have been working on having the photos taken by the camera on a 'drone' to be streamed to a 2nd phone. This was after consultation and feedback from my previous research note. 

As such, having to get into your mailbox to access the photos will be a 2nd option to those who feel the need to.

###My attempt and results
My first attempt on getting a photo taken and immediately streamed to a 2nd device is what I am currently looking into.

I am getting 'broken' images, or rather broken image links, on the 2nd device, so I still want to crack the bug. If it persists for longer, I'll be posting some 'call for help' in the next few days.. Hoping not :-)
