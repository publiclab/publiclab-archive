###The user guide..
An elaborate user-guide has been added to Sky Cam. Under Homepage >> 'Guide' menu >> Sky cam guide

My aim here was to try and pull more users to explore and use this amazing app, hence the need for breaking down the application and its go-abouts.

Any ideas to further make Sky Cam as open-ended as possible for the user are highly welcomed.. 

###Link to .apk file
Please test the app and all feedback is highly welcomed :) .. [.apk file here](https://github.com/mercyorangi/sky-camera/blob/branch2/bin/Sky%20Cam.apk)

So far, I have tested the app on a Samsung Galaxy S2, Android version 4.1

Will be interesting to see how the app responds on other phones + Android versions

###The app icon..
A new app icon has been designed for Sky Cam too.. takes the app's theme color + a rough sketch of a bird flying with a camera.

Any views on improving it are highly welcomed!

###Work-plan for remaining GSoC2014 days
+ Work on app behavior when screen orientation changes
+ Create a technical guide for future collaborators of Sky Cam
+ Finish on code documentation, in terms of inline code commenting/elaboration
