##Abstract
This project mainly deals in improving sky cam android application in functionality(backend) and design, frontend. The project describes how some features will be improved and integrated with existing features.

##The needs my project fulfills
- Eliminate the need to configure the camera settings all the time
- Create a home/landing page instead of launching the camera immediately.

##How my project will meet this need
The plans I have during GSoC 2014 will help me achieve this. They are outline below;
1. Create a homepage for Sky Cam, with the main features as icons to be selected by the user
2. Add a feature for low power mode by disabling the screen during a flight
3. Improve the Sky Cam action bar, icon alignment and arrangement, and so as to follow a specific theme

##Milestones
