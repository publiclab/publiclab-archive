I would like to know documented experiences on the development of a community science app in which the community also engages in the design process. Sort of like the [participatory-action-research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_action_research "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_action_research") approach, applied to the development of technological tools.  
Thank you!!
