Recently I am using Python for my all data science related assignments and even for any mathematical problem. Recently I have known about Julia which is completely new language and has more maths friendly syntax, even it is using c# s compiler so definitely, it would be much faster than python, so the question is about what can we trust on julia over python, even I would say that python has the bigger community support  as compare to Julia.
