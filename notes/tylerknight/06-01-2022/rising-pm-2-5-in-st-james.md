Another month of data, another month observing high PM 2.5 events in St James Parish.

Last month we reported data from March to April from the three Public Lab Air Monitors around St James. This month, we have more data from April to May, including a long, elevated event starting the day before Mother's Day, and continuing for five consecutive days. As always, you can continue to track PM 2.5 from our deployed Purple Air monitors from the [Purple Air Map](https://map.purpleair.com/1/a/mPM25/a10/p604800/cC0#11.15/30.0071/-90.8466).

Similar to last month, the average PM 2.5 at all three sites over a 30-day period was less than 12 μg/m3\. A reminder, 12 μg/m3 is the EPA annual standard for PM2.5 exposure, while 35 μg/m3 is the 24-hour standard. The average PM 2.5 at all three sites rose compared to the previous month, with Vacherie again showing the highest average of 9.26 μg/m3\. This is a disturbing trend, as the average creeps ever higher, exposure increases and the air becomes unhealthier to breathe.

Also like last month, a significant amount of cumulative time at each site had concentrations above 12 μg/m3 - 9.3 days at Vacherie, 7.8 days at St James, and 5.3 days at Welcome. While no spikes were observed as high as those seen in the previous month, with maximum concentrations at all three sites seen around 50 μg/m3, there were more spikes above 12 μg/m3 overall compared to last month.

The length of high PM 2.5 events also increased. Last month, the longest elevated event was around 19 hours. This month, however, PM 2.5 concentrations started climbing on May 8th and lasted until May 13th. While the more than five days of concentrations over 12 μg/m3 doesn't exceed the annual standard, that's a troubling amount of time to be exposed to high concentration PM 2.5\. On May 8th, a community member reported visible smoke from many plants in the area, including from Nucor Steel and Mosaic Fertilizer, which could be potential sources of particulate matter emissions during this event.

Both increasing average PM 2.5 and increasing duration of elevated events is a concerning trend to see. We will continue to monitor the data for trends, and encourage anyone who notices visible emissions or elevated concentrations of PM 2.5 to reach out with their observations.
