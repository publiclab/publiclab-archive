In our 6th edition of Grassroots Mapping Forum we will be examining trash. We make things, we discard things, we reuse some things. Many in the Public Lab community have spent countless hours observing trash whether intentionally or not. This Forum is a place for anyone in the community to share their reflections and musings related to trash and waste.

GMF#6 will feature Mathew Lippincott's outline of [detritivore designs](http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2013/04/detritivore-design-how-to-use-trash-to-create-scalable-tech-solutions109/), using abundant waste products to make scalable technology solutions.  With Public Lab's kits,"We’re developing a platform on top of ubiquitous trash, using its persistent nature to escape the ephemerality of the startup culture in which we design." We will also feature an article by Pablo Rey Mazón of Spain's [Basurama](http://basurama.org/en/). Basurama explores trash, waste and reuse in all its formats and possible meanings. 

We have room for several more articles and I would love to hear from you.  

Let me know if you're interested by July 3rd so I can determine word lengths for everyone. Final pieces will be due to me Friday, July 25th.
