I'm looking for precedents upon which to base language about how data can be co-owned by communities and university researchers in environmental or health studies (especially when there is personally identifiable information attached to the data).

  
I found [this](http://www.duq.edu/academics/community-engaged-teaching-and-research/faculty/community-engaged-research) website that lists co-ownership as a key value of community science, but not really any rubrics to follow.  Hopefully there are a lot of great examples out there and we can make a wiki with these resources. 

  
Thanks!
