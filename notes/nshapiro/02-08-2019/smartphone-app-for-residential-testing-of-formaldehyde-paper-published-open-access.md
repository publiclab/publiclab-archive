We're excited to announce that the exposure chamber validation and field test of our open-source and low-cost formaldehyde monitoring system has been published in _Building & Environment_. [Here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132318307248) is a link to the open access article. With the abstract and highlights below.

## Highlights

**•A
low-cost, easy-to-use screening tool measures chemical contaminants
indoors by combining smartphone technology with a color-changing badge.**

**•The app was developed using a community-based approach.**

**•This
enables simpler in-home contaminant measurement, with implications for
environmental health professionals and citizen scientists.**

## Abstract

[Chemical contamination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/chemical-contamination "Learn more about Chemical Contamination") is ubiquitous in the [indoor environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/indoor-environment "Learn more about Indoor Environment"), but measurement options are often limited outside of research studies. This is especially true for [formaldehyde](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/formaldehyde "Learn more about Formaldehyde"),
a known carcinogen and irritant. The goal of this project was to
develop a novel screening tool: a smartphone-based app that can be
paired with low-cost colorimetric badges for detection of indoor
formaldehyde. The target users include citizen scientists, concerned
citizens, public health nurses visiting homes, and researchers with
relevant measurement needs. The [user interface](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/user-interface "Learn more about user interface") was designed using a collaborative [development model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/development-model "Learn more about Development Model").
Badges were exposed to air for 72 h, and the user takes images that are
analyzed in the phone. The app itself measures illumination (lightness)
to determine [color change](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/color-change "Learn more about Color Change"), which was associated with formaldehyde concentration (R2 = 0.8811, _P_ < 0.0001).
The detectable range was 20--120 ppb and the standard deviation of
readings was 10.9 ppb. Warnings were integrated into the app to address
current limitations, including sensitivity to extreme [lighting conditions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lighting-condition "Learn more about Lighting Condition") and elevated (\>80%) [relative humidity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/relative-humidity "Learn more about relative humidity"). Co-exposure to [acetaldehyde](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/acetaldehyde "Learn more about Acetaldehyde") or a VOC mixture did not interfere with measurement (_P_ = 0.93, _P_ = 0.07, respectively). Overall, this screening tool can provide inexpensive, [accessible information](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/accessible-information "Learn more about Accessible Information") to users about their formaldehyde exposure, which can inform further testing and potential [remediation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/remediation "Learn more about Remediation") activities.
