Hi Everyone,

We are hosting an Open Call on Tuesday, January 16th at 3:00 pm ET, to discuss an ongoing project developing a smartphone app that quantitatively determines formaldehyde concentration based on a passive colorimetric sampling device. Please join us! You can read more about the project here: [https://publiclab.org/wiki/smart-form](https://publiclab.org/wiki/smart-form) and [https://u.osu.edu/smartform/](https://u.osu.edu/smartform/). In the Open Call, we'll discuss background of the project and dive into how the app works, and how we can use it. One of the reasons we are so excited about this project is the potential for this program to be applied to a variety of colorimetric tests for hazardous gases, allowing for much more quantitative results than are usually achievable from a colorimetric badge or tube. [Here](https://youtu.be/VpkeoIRmpOk) is a short video of how to use the app in its current iteration. 

We'll discuss the feasibility of the app or derivatives of it to be applied to other color-change systems. Join by computer or phone 3:00 - 4:00 pm ET (UTC -5) Link to join: [https://zoom.us/j/415220636](https://zoom.us/j/415220636) +1 408 638 0968 (US Toll) or +1 646 558 8656 (US Toll)
