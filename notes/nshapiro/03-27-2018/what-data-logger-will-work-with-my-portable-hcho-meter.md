Hi! I'll be doing some environmental monitoring of formaldehyde (HCHO) next month as part of the [SmART-Form](https://publiclab.org/wiki/smart-form) project that is developing a low-cost formaldehyde detection system. In a couple of the homes we're going to be analyzing HCHO levels in real time to see how those real time levels compare to the system we are developing, which takes an average over three days. To do this we are using an Interscan portable HCHO meter. [Here's](https://www.gasdetection.com/wp-content/uploads/4000_series_digital.pdf) the manual.

The meter has an output of the following specification: : ¼" phone jack for Analog recorder output connection. Typically 0-100mV. Tip --positive, Ring -- ground.

What [public lab stocked](https://publiclab.org/wiki/data-logging) data-logger would work best with this application?

Kind thanks for your help!
