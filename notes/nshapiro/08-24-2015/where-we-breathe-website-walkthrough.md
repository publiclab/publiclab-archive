###Where We Breathe

For the past year-and-a-half @warren [Nicole Novak](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicole_Novak) @mmmelissa @shannon @becki and I have been working on developing a web platform that will serve as a meeting point for people quietly enduring chronic formaldehyde (HCHO) exposure. Currently the website is only for manufactured homes, which have higher levels of HCHO than conventional homes, but hopefully soon the project will be expanded to all homes. It is a site where people can, together, leverage their own bodies as evidence of the ongoing harms of HCHO exposure (see a [paper ](http://www.culanth.org/articles/781-attuning-to-the-chemosphere-domestic)we just published on this) through an epidemiologically validated survey and work together to analyze the data and share their stories in non-quantified ways. Where We Breathe is a place where community science, digital storytelling and community organizing meet. 

We have been largely working on [github ](https://github.com/publiclab/wherewebreathe)to get a basic version of the site up, but we are reaching a point where its ready to share with the Public Lab community. Below I've embedded a walkthrough of the website so far. We're extremely proud of the work we've done so far, attempting to reconcile both the needs of valid data collection and community self-determination of research questions, but we still have a lot of work to do. 

Let us know what you think!
