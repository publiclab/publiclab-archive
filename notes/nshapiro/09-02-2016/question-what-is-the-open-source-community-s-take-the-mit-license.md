###What I want to do or know

Is the [MIT Open License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) fundamentally different than CC licences that do not claim to be copyrights? Is it essentially the same as Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License?

###Background story

I'm working with a collaborator who is trying to get their open licences in order and one of their collaborators at MIT was interested in using the MIT license and I wanted to see if there would be any reasons for encouraging them to use a CC license before that license is applied at the end of September.
