A public interest lawyer in Louisiana contacted me to inquire about the best and least expensive way to test for mold so that she can advocate on behalf of her clients and against slum lords. Does anyone on this list have any suggestions, be they commercial test kits or university lab collaborations? 

I've been wondering this myself as mold is such a ubiquitous concern and governmental regulators that I or my collaborators have spoken with seems to pretty universally dismis the results of DIY mold tests.  I know some doctors recommend the ERMI (Environmental Relative Moldiness Index) or HERTSMI-2 tests that document genetic material in dust swabs but don't enumerate mycotoxic concentrations. Would love to hear others' experiences with this!
