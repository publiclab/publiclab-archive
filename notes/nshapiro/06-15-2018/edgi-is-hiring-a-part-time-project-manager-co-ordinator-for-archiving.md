Position Summary

The [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org/) (EDGI) is searching for a Remote Project Manager for a 12-month, three-quarters time contracted position, to help us set the direction of archiving projects, direct development, and coordinate with volunteers and other organizations around our Archiving Working Group. The position will begin in September and is potentially renewable for an additional 9 months.

Video call interviews will be conducted June 26-27\. Candidates will need to make themselves available on those dates. EDGI will make every effort to provide reasonable advance notice of interview schedule.

About EDGI

The Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI) is a network of academics and non-profits addressing potential threats to United States federal environmental and energy policy, and to the scientific research infrastructure built to investigate, inform, and enforce them. EDGI is a distributed collaboration operating under the fiscal sponsorship of the non-profit, [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/), with volunteer members across North America. EDGI working groups:

- monitor changes to tens of thousands of web pages across U.S. federal agencies (such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy) to trace how environmental data, information, and their presentation change;
- interview long-time federal employees to provide a human and nuanced perspective on impacts of the current administration on agencies;
- run public campaigns on and analyze environmental, energy, and climate policy and regulation, focusing on changes in agency's governance of scientific information and data;
- develop community-driven processes for archiving, stewarding, and sharing data (especially environmental data), with the aim of building just and sustainable relationships between data and communities (this is the working group you'll be working with); and
- recognize the many conflicting justice concerns that data manifests and aims to bring together research communities to struggle together across these differences with a commitment to intersectional justice.

Location

Remote. You must be legally able to work in the United States.

Term

This is a grant-funded position with a salary of approximately $4000/month. The Archiving Remote Project Manager will work approximately 30 hours per week (three-quarters time), with some flexibility from week to week and an expectation of higher commitment levels during busy periods. This is a contracted position for one year, with the possibility of renewal for the remainder of the grant period, approximately 9 additional months. The first three months of the contract will be considered a trial period.

- Organize community events to prototype and refine archiving practices and projects
- Lead creation of public "User Journeys" detailing challenges for maintaining public access to environmental data
- Manage process of "Problem Mapping" to understand different assessments for determining how public environmental data is "vulnerable"
- Re-launch EDGI's Archiving Toolkit with reusable resources for groups engaged in similar activities
- Represent EDGI within the Data Together partnership and bring new organizations into the project
- Write the Archiving portion of the monthly grants progress report for our fiscal sponsor, Public Lab
- Coordinate with EDGI's financial team regarding Archiving expenses

- Good written and verbal communication skills
- Availability to work across North American time zones during business and off-peak hours to support remote volunteer development community (we use Slack and Zoom extensively)

- Adherence to policies and procedures; support for[EDGI's mission, vision, and values](https://envirodatagov.org/about/mission-vision-values/), which include justice; environmental and human health; intersectionality; anti-facism, anti-racism, and anti-oppression; accessibility; participatory knowledge making; and responsivity and proactivity
