Does anyone have tips for making masks more effective w a beard? I'm asking at the request of people on the inside that have beards for religious reasons and have cellmates that are all over the facility (w confirmed cases) for work. All the advice I see is "just shave it" but that shouldn't be the only way.  Theyâ€™re sleeping w their mask on, terrified.

I've seen articles about some masks being made in isreal to accommodate beards but haven't seen any plans. the masks used in prison are non-medical grade, made of cloth. ![image description][1]
