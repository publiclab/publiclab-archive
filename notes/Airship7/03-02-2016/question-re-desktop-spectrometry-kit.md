###What I want to do or know

Is the Desktop Spectrometry Kit useful at measuring and quantifying the amount of light of various wave lengths, present in a given light source?
I see that these kits were used to study the light absorbed by various materials. Is this tool useful at measuring the type and quantity of light emitted by various light sources?
  
###Background story

I wish to quantify the amount of light of various wavelengths present in a light source. I am just looking at visible light spectrum. My goal is to examine the light emitted by various forms of street lighting in order to identify potential sources of light pollution.
