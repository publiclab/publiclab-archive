This YouTube video shows the process of building a model, exporting it, cleaning it, and transforming it to the proper scale. While these procedures are illustrated at the scale of excavation, the procedures could be applied to larger objects like pits or piles. Perhaps these methods will serve useful for others needing low cost options for scaled 3D reconstructions.
