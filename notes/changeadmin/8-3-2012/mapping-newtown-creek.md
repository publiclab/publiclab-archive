Image from our first attempt at kite-mapping Newtown Creek with Liz Barry and the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science. (Change Admin studio in the background). Over the next few months, we will be systematically mapping Newtown Creek, and using the data to engage in environmental and public space interventions. Let me know if you're interested in supporting or participating.
