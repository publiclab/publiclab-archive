# Rotating magnetic field induced currents in human body -ANALGESIC EFFECT - X device

Research purpose : to investigate the influence of the rotating magnetic field generated by a spinning neodymium sphere, on human body. Generating rotating magnetic fields with a single permanent magnet inducing an electrical field in the human body. **To create a new class of small, low-cost devices for magnetic stimulation of nerves and muscles, using high speed rotation of permanent magnet , generating a sustained sinusoidal electric field using very low power.** (source power bank , usb port 5 V X 5500 mAH)

**How does it work ?** Our cells are specialized to conduct electrical currents. Electricity is required for the nervous system to send signals throughout the body and to the brain, making it possible for us to move, think and feel. The elements in our bodies, like sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, have a specific electrical charge.

Almost all of our cells can use these charged elements, called ions, to generate electricity.The contents of the cell are protected from the outside environment by a cell membrane. This cell membrane is made up of lipids that create a barrier that only certain substances can cross to reach the cell interior. Not only does the cell membrane function as a barrier to molecules, it also acts as a way for the cell to generate electrical currents. Resting cells are negatively charged on the inside, while the outside environment is more positively charged. This is due to a slight imbalance between positive and negative ions inside and outside the cell. Cells can achieve this charge separation by allowing charged ions to flow in and out through the membrane. The flow of charges across the cell membrane is what generates electrical currents.

Cells control the flow of specific charged elements across the membrane with proteins that sit on the cell surface and create an opening for certain ions to pass through. These proteins are called ion channels. When a cell is stimulated, it allows positive charges to enter the cell through open ion channels. The inside of the cell then becomes more positively charged, which triggers further electrical currents that can turn into electrical pulses, called action potentials. Our bodies use certain patterns of action potentials to initiate the correct movements, thoughts and behaviors.

**A disruption in electrical currents can lead to illness**. For example, in order for the heart to pump, cells must generate electrical currents that allow the heart muscle to contract at the right time.

With other words the HUMAN BODY IS "A COMPLEX CHEMICAL BATTERY ".

The magnetic field, generated by the X device, produces weak electric currents in the body. As soon as exposure to the field ends, these weak currents stop; therefore, the body does not accumulate any current. A fixed time-varying field may induce notable currents at the macroscopic level but much smaller ones at the cellular level - a human body generates between 10 and 100 mv.

**FLUX DENSITY AT A DISTANCE Z TO THE SPHERE**

z = 0 mm =\> B = 8115 Gauss = 0.811 Tesla

z = 10 mm =\> B = 3059 Gauss = 0.306 Tesla

z = 20 mm =\> B = 1467 Gauss = 0.147 Tesla

z = 30 mm =\> B = 813 Gauss = 0.081 Tesla

z = 40 mm =\> B = 490 Gauss = 0.05 Tesla

**FREQUENCY (Hz)**

frequency (Hz) = RPM x P/120\*\*

P = number of magnetic poles = 2

RPM = 8000 =\> **133,33 Hz**

Time-varying magnetic fields induce currents in living tissues 
in accordance with the Faraday law of induction.  

The strength of the field at the Earth's surface ranges from less than 30 mictoteslas (0.3 Gauss) in an area including most of South America and South Africa to over 60 microteslas (0.6 Gauss).

Several laboratory studies have been conducted with human 
subjects exposed to sinusoidally time-varying magnetic fields with 
frequencies in the ELF range.  

Time-varying magnetic fields generate internal electric 
currents.  For example, 3 T/s can induce current densities of about 
30 ÂµA/m2 around the perimeter of the human head.
