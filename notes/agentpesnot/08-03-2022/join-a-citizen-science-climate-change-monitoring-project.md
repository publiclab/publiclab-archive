Hey! I recently came across the [Dream sensor](https://supersensor.myshopify.com/) and thought it might be of interest to the people in this community. It's a sensor to monitor greenhouse gases (GHGs). All the GHG data will be put on a map so that companies know exactly where to direct efforts to reduce GHG emissions, which reduces global warming.

  
It seems like a great way to monitor the air quality around me while helping a greater climate effort. I just submitted a reservation for a sensor - anyone interested in joining?
