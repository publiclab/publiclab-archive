For the first [research area review](https://publiclab.org/wiki/reviews) of this year, we're focusing on **mining land reclamation**. We'll examine what reclamation is and the avenues that community scientists might pursue within this topic--from monitoring sites undergoing reclamation to participating in regulatory processes.
