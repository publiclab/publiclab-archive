We're about halfway through the [research area review on soil contamination](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/01-25-2021/research-area-review-on-soil-events) that we started in late January. What's happened since we started and what's still to come? Read on for a brief update!

### New materials and resources

Below are some new questions, activities, and wiki pages on Public Lab that came out of conversations with community members:

- Question: [What are other ways to assess soil contamination, besides directly measuring contaminant concentrations?](https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/02-05-2021/what-are-other-ways-to-assess-soil-contamination-besides-directly-measuring-contaminant-concentrations)
- Question: [Does anyone have experience with remediation of contaminated soils? What are some different options?](https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/02-09-2021/does-anyone-have-experience-with-remediation-of-contaminated-soils-what-are-some-different-options)
- Question: [Are there ways to trace detected soil contaminants back to the polluting source?](https://publiclab.org/questions/amocorro/02-10-2021/are-there-ways-to-trace-detected-soil-contaminants-back-to-the-polluting-source "https://publiclab.org/questions/amocorro/02-10-2021/are-there-ways-to-trace-detected-soil-contaminants-back-to-the-polluting-source")
- Activity: [How to find out past and current uses for an area of land](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/02-19-2021/how-to-find-out-past-and-current-uses-for-an-area-of-land) - A getting-started activity for people interested in eventual soil testing.
- Wiki page: [Bioassay](https://publiclab.org/wiki/bioassay) - Resources on another way to assess soil contamination. Includes links to a guide on a DIY bioassay procedure using lettuce seeds!

### Conversation spotlight

The Public Lab community has responded to the questions posted above with fantastic ideas and insights. In case you missed it, [this comment by ](https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/02-09-2021/does-anyone-have-experience-with-remediation-of-contaminated-soils-what-are-some-different-options#c28208 "https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/02-09-2021/does-anyone-have-experience-with-remediation-of-contaminated-soils-what-are-some-different-options#c28208")@DanielleS on bioremediation is chock full of information and includes a link to an excellent factsheet she created on "Bioremediation for Urban Gardeners." Check it out!

We've been holding weekly Open Calls to talk about soil and are keeping [notes on soil-related updates in this notepad](https://pad.publiclab.org/p/opencall).

### What's next

- Our OpenHour on March 8, 8:30am PT / 11:30am ET, on **[(Soil!) Stories from the Underground](https://publiclab.org/openhour#March+8,+2021,+11:30am+ET,+%28Soil!%29+Stories+from+the+Underground)**. We'll gather with community members to share our stories and collective learning moments around investigating soil.
- We'll continue to **post new resources and update existing pages** on soil contamination. Look out for materials on evaluating soil test results and remediation.
- We're still having **soil-themed [Open Calls](https://publiclab.org/wiki/open-call "https://publiclab.org/wiki/open-call") every Tuesday** until March 30\. Drop in any time!
- We're getting ready for our **soil review wrap event** on March 31 when we'll share highlights from the whole review. Look out for an event post with details soon.
