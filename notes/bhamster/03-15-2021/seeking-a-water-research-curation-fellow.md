_About Public Lab: Public Lab is a community, supported by a 501(c)(3) non-profit, that develops and applies open-source tools to environmental exploration and investigation. By democratizing inexpensive and accessible do-it-yourself techniques, Public Lab creates a collaborative network of practitioners who actively reimagine the human relationship with the environment._

### About the Research Curation Fellowships

Research Curation Fellowships enable individuals with experience and interest in an environmental health topic related to air, water, soil/land, or community organizing and advocacy to grow both their personal knowledge, as well as a larger network of collaborators within that topic area on Public Lab's platforms. Research Fellows will work individually in their research area, and as a cohort among other Research Curation Fellows to share knowledge and best practices across topics.

### Water Research Curation Fellowship---Specifics

This fellow will work to support research on Public Lab related to water broadly, with attention to several subtopics in more depth such as pollutants (e.g., herbicides/pesticides and fertilizers, heavy metals, thermal pollution), state or federal regulations around water, and approaches to accessible technologies for water quality monitoring. Candidates with experience in any of these topic areas are encouraged to apply.

**The major goals of this Fellowship for each topic area are to:**

1. Network with scientists, technologists, and/or organizers working in the environmental topic area and invite contributions to Public Lab's community science resources in this area.
2. Organize quarterly virtual events where contributors and other interested community members can connect on the environmental topic.
3. Co-organize a once annual, three-month period of focused outreach and content development in their focus topic area with Public Lab's Research Coordinator, culminating in a half-day event featuring research highlights, community conversations, and demos or live builds of environmental monitoring tools.

### Commitments in this Fellowship

**Getting started:**

- Attend the [March 31 Research Area Review event for Soil & Land](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/03-04-2021/digging-into-soil-research-public-lab-virtual-event-on-soil-contamination) to see what a "State of the Community Science" event for a topic entails (see this component of the Fellowship below).
