We're interested in approaches that could apply in situations where affected residents might not have continuous access to cell phones or wifi.  

This is a complementary question to conversations about how to use text notifications to communicate air quality data ([example here](https://publiclab.org/questions/purpleairfan/10-04-2021/are-real-time-pm-2-5-push-warnings-from-the-purpleair-possible)).   

Thank you for any ideas or examples!
