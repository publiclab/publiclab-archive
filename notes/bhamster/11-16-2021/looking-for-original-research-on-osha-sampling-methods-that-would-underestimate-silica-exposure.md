Hi! An inquiry came in about material on the [silica monitoring wiki page](https://publiclab.org/wiki/silica-monitoring#OSHA+sampling), which states:

> The sampling techniques outlined by OSHA for occupational silica exposure would systematically underestimate silica exposure in non-occupational ambient settings

Is there original research or other sources that inform this statement about erroneous estimates? Any tips or leads would be greatly appreciated!
