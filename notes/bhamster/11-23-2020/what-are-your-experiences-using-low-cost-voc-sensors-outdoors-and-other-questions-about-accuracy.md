I'm hoping to build off previous posts about volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors ([here](https://publiclab.org/questions/stevie/02-28-2020/does-anyone-have-experience-assembling-low-cost-voc-kits-using-adafruit-s-voc-sensor) about the CCS811 sensor, and [here](https://publiclab.org/questions/stevie/02-06-2020/are-there-any-other-professional-instruments-that-measures-different-voc-besides-pid-photoionisation-detector) about PID sensors), and synthesize information on low-cost VOC sensors for the current [research area review on outdoor air quality](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/10-20-2020/research-area-review-on-air-quality).

**What are people's experiences using low-cost VOC sensors outdoors?**

A couple of air quality researchers I've talked to say that currently available low-cost metal oxide (MOX) and photoionization detector (PID) sensors don't produce accurate data.

A few related questions:

- What can cause these VOC sensors to produce inaccurate data?
- What can/do people use these low-cost VOC sensors for? E.g., initial investigations into relative total VOCs, etc.
- What's needed to improve the accuracy of low-cost VOC sensor data? E.g., hardware improvements, calibrations/corrections, etc.?

Thanks for any insights folx can share!
