The next topic we'll be reviewing and updating on Public Lab is...**microplastics**!

### What's the purpose of the review?

We'll update the microplastics wiki page and other related pages on the Public Lab website so that **newcomers will know where to begin in microplastics monitoring, tool development, and advocacy.**

### What will we do in the review to reach this goal?

We'll turn to Public Lab and other resources to learn about and synthesize information on:

- Currently available and emerging **approaches and methods** to monitor microplastics pollution in water
- Which **communities** might be impacted by microplastics pollution
- **Advocacy** that communities can do with microplastics pollution data
- What's still **unknown** in microplastics research and potential **next steps**

...and more as we uncover new information and challenges.

### When will we do the review?

Over the next several weeks until late September 2020\. Over that time, we'll have opportunities to share resources and challenges, and to synthesize together.

### Why did we choose microplastics?

We chose microplastics based on interest from communities in Public Lab and beyond. After this review, we'll regularly review other topics in a similar way, and will be seeking community input on which topics to prioritize next.

### What are some ways to help or follow along?

- Have you heard of microplastics monitoring projects happening in your community or elsewhere? Please share!
- Do you have knowledge, experiences, or stories to share on microplastics monitoring, tool development, or advocacy? Please share those, too!
