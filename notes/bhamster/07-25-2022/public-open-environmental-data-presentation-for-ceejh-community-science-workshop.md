In November 2021, @bhamster presented at a workshop on "Democratizing Science", part of a community science workshop series organized and hosted by Rachel Casteel at the [Center for Community Engagement, Environmental Justice, and Health (CEEJH)](https://www.ceejh.center/).

The presentation on **"Public & Open Environmental Data"** covered what kinds of public environmental data exist, examples of where to find public data based on your goals, some limitations with existing data, and ideas on putting public data to use.

The presentation slides ðŸ“Š are below, and a [video recording ðŸŽ¥ of the workshop and participant discussion is available here](https://umd.zoom.us/rec/play/BKHahoWoBvuAs8HjbQSS7kS94TmHU58QPgPidArYeue9broB1-ThD5VGKqaMelCFLC91CZsb94VvtMH0.7g2xnzDLJyQZ5daJ?startTime=1637362817000&_x_zm_rtaid=EYwU0e3mR9CKqRGM1BtfeQ.1658771721086.af38697e039b3d584cb3d86b6b2747bb&_x_zm_rhtaid=186).
