This builds off a question that[@abbykinchy](https://publiclab.org/profile/abbykinchy) asked during the [soil research area review kick-off call ](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/01-25-2021/event-welcome-to-the-soil-research-area-review)and one of the [current challenges](https://publiclab.org/wiki/soil#Current+Challenges:) identified on the soil contamination wiki.

  
Typical analytical techniques that soil testing labs use to measure heavy metals and organic contaminants in soil samples can get expensive. Maybe as a complementary or screening step, what kinds of methods and indicators could offer proxies for soil contamination?
