We've wrapped up our latest collaborative [research area review on mapping for community organizing and advocacy](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/04-27-2021/research-area-review-on-mapping-for-organizing-and-advocacy "https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/04-27-2021/research-area-review-on-mapping-for-organizing-and-advocacy")!

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
We created some new activities and wiki pages especially geared toward people who are getting started with local community science projects and place-based organizing. Here’s where you’ll find all the new and updated material:

This collaborative topic review started off in mid-May with a kick-off call ([notes here](https://pad.publiclab.org/p/opencall)). Joining the call were Public Lab community members in the early stages of investigating local concerns ranging from neighborhood air quality to pollinator diversity. We talked about project updates, questions and challenges, and how to participate in the research area review. This call and the lively Open Calls that followed each week helped to shape the focus of the research area review going forward. As questions came out of each conversation, we [posted questions and shared answers](https://publiclab.org/questions/tag/organizing).

**Thank you to everyone who shared knowledge, resources, time, and stories about mapping and advocacy during the review!** 🎉

## End-of-review events

In late June and early July we held several public events on mapping, organizing, and advocacy.

<br>

### 🗺️ Organize and advocate with maps! Wrapping up Public Lab's latest research area review

<br>
  
On this call, we featured the new activities and resources we created on mapping for organizing and advocacy. Julia, the Research Curation Fellow for Organizing and Advocacy, then created space for people on the call to continue dialogue on the topic. You'll find a [recording of the event and all the links shared during the call here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/reviews#June+30,+2021:+Mapping+for+organizing+&+advocacy+research+area+review).

### 🎈📷 Live build of a camera mount for balloon mapping

<br>
  
Alahna showed us step-by-step how to make a nifty device for attaching a camera to a balloon for aerial photography. We also learned about the history of balloon mapping kits at Public Lab and Alahna's balloon mapping tips and tricks. Check out a [recording of the live build and links sharing during the call here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/reviews#June+30,+2021:+Mapping+for+organizing+&+advocacy+research+area+review)!

### 🗣️ Mapping for organizing: Guest speaker panel

We took the theme of "Mapping _FOR_ Organizing" as an invitation to explore how participatory spatial notation---which includes a wide range of processes from community walking tours to aerial imaging to digital mapping---enables a community to combine their traditional and local knowledge as well as empirical observations of the world in order to build social bonds, develop shared problem definitions as well as shared vision → which translates to political power. This session brought together people from incredible, expansive projects that could have each presented in a dedicated event, so we chose to switch up the usual presentation format and instead do rounds of answering a series of prompts enabling us to see across projects: 
 
- _A surprising anecdote to bring the listener right into the essence of your work_
- _Your heartfelt motivation why you are called to this work, why it is strategic_
- _An insight into your tactics for technical mapping success_
- _An insight into your tactics for organizing for advocacy_
- _What of your many lessons learned do you feel the fewest other people know?_

Guest presenters included:   

- **Xose Quiroga** of [https://imvec.tech/](https://imvec.tech/) The Institute for Grassroots Monitoring of Contaminated Areas is a non-profit organization dedicated to the training and accompaniment of communities affected by contamination processes in their environmental investigations. Since 2015, the Institute also develops open and free environmental investigation methods and tools in an effort to bring forensic investigation techniques and tools closer to the affected communities. Through the portal https://regist.ro/en, IMVEC publishes the tools and methods, employing an ultra-lightweight web portal to facilitate access in areas with little or no internet coverage. Through a hidden portal in the Tor network, IMVEC makes available to the collectives that need it, a hidden digital work platform to protect the privacy and anonymity of the users, usually targeted by threats from environmental aggressors. The platform is accessible using the Tor Browser at the following link: http://o5ss65db4oowvkobyebvttphtlglc464icnwdjfziylfl55au2iyizid.onion/#english
- **Jeffrey Yoo Warren** (he/him) is a Korean-american artist, community scientist, illustrator, and researcher in Providence, RI, who collaboratively creates community science projects which decenter dominant culture in environmental knowledge production.

Jeff is a member of AS220 in Providence and served three terms on the Open Source Hardware Association board since 2014\. In 2010, he co-founded Public Lab, a community science network and non-profit dedicated to democratizing science to address environmental issues that affect people. After 10 years as Director of Research, he stepped down at the start of 2020 but remains involved as a project administrator and mentor of programs which support diversity, equity, and inclusion in technology.

Four hundred homes are covered in the buyout plan.
