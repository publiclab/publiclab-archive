## Event details

**When**: Wednesday, March 31, 8:30am PT / 10:30am CT / 11:30am ET / 3:30pm UTC / [other time zones](https://everytimezone.com/s/43a98de4). This event will run for approximately 1 hr 15 mins.

**Where**: <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/87113329611?pwd=WkxSNUpTcVdUbG16Y1dHbFQxOHZtZz09">Click here to Join Zoom Meeting</a>

**What**: a time to welcome each other to the topic of [soil contamination](https://publiclab.org/wiki/soil), highlights in research and advocacy, and ideas for what to do next.

This is another installment of Public Lab's quarterly virtual get-togethers around an environmental topic. We'll share highlights from the current [research area review on soil](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/01-25-2021/research-area-review-on-soil-events) and talk about ways that people can get started in investigating their soil. We'll save the last 30 minutes of the call for group reflection and discussion. 
<br>  

## Who is this event for?

**Anyone who's interested in soil contamination**, especially those looking for a supportive community as they begin researching local concerns about soil pollution and remediation.

If you're new to soil research, we'll highlight some accessible ways to start. If you're a seasoned researcher, experimentalist, or hardware developer, we'll also highlight some next step challenges in accessible soil research methods.
<br>  

## There's more!

Stay tuned for information about another event we'll have on soil community science _after this event on the same day_. A day of soil! More to come soon.
