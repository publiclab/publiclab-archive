This question came out of the [kick-off call](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/04-28-2021/event-welcome-to-a-research-area-review-on-mapping-for-organizing-advocacy) for the latest research area review on mapping for organizing and advocacy. Several people said that one of the biggest challenges encountered in their community organizing was first helping other people to become aware of a local environmental issue.   

Organizers from @LESBreathe, for example, shared that some residents who regularly visit East River Park in New York City were surprised to learn [it was closing](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/04-22-2021/soil-testing-at-a-massive-construction-site-in-the-lower-east-side).   

What are some ways that folx have used to raise awareness in this early part of community organizing?
