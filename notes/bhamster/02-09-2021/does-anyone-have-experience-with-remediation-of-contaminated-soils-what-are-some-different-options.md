I'm interested in what options there are for remediation after someone confirms that their soil is contaminated with heavy metals, hazardous organic compounds, or other pollutants.   

Phytoremediation, bioremediation with microbes? Building upon this question: [Are there lists of plants and the chemicals they can remediate?](https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/06-26-2018/are-there-lists-of-plants-and-the-chemicals-they-can-remediate)

Chemical treatments?

Physical methods? 

What kinds of areas or degrees of contamination are different approaches effective for? 

How do you know if remediation is or isn't working?

  
Thanks for sharing any experiences or ideas! I'll comment with ideas below and start a wiki if there's lots to gather and organize.
