I recently heard about data stories from @renee, as a way to create a narrative story around a set of data and make it meaningful.   

Does anyone have experience crafting a data story for their environmental data?   
We're hoping to build some resources around how to create and use data stories for the [research area review on air quality data](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/10-18-2021/delving-into-air-quality-data-for-our-next-research-area-review). Thanks!
