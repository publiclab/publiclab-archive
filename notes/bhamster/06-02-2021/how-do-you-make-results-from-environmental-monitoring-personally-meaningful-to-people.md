This question has come up a couple times during our recent Open Calls ([notes here](http://pad.publiclab.org/p/opencall)) on organizing and advocacy.

The folx at @LESBreathe, for example, are starting a community-led air quality monitoring project that will generate data on particulate matter in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. At first, they will collect baseline data on air quality before a major construction project begins.

**How can you make air quality results _mean_ something to community members so that they will feel encouraged to take action?**

Thanks for sharing any strategies that you've used or have experienced yourself!

Also, this relates to another separate question: [How do you turn results about environmental pollution into personal actions that people can take?](https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/06-02-2021/how-do-you-turn-results-about-environmental-pollution-into-personal-actions-that-people-can-take "https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/06-02-2021/how-do-you-turn-results-about-environmental-pollution-into-personal-actions-that-people-can-take")

These questions seem closely linked---wondering what things you can _do_ in response to environmental data once you know its significance.
