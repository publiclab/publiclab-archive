Join us on a call to kick-off a collaborative [research area review](https://publiclab.org/wiki/reviews) on **wastewater**. This includes "used water" that's created by residential buildings, businesses, and industries, and surface runoff from roadways and parking lots. We'll be starting the conversation around DIY tools to detect and document potential wastewater pollution in rivers, streams, and other water bodies that people might encounter. **If you have a local concern about wastewater or have used tools that could be used to investigate wastewater pollution, we'd want to hear from you!**

  
**WHEN: Tuesday, July 27, at 12pm PT / 3pm ET / 7pm UTC /** [other time zones](https://everytimezone.com/s/3022e65a), during Public Lab's regularly-scheduled [Open Call](https://publiclab.org/wiki/open-call).   

**WHERE**: We'll meet on Zoom.  <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/934187763?pwd=eVRFMHJ2UmlRZ3lwZnIwZ3dhWk5iZz09">Click here to join Zoom Meeting</a> 

**WHAT**: We'll meet each other and share initial questions and concerns about wastewater, and talk about how we can collectively create knowledge and tools to support community science research on this topic. We'll talk about what we'll do over the next few months of the research area review, and **how you can participate**! More details on the research area review to come soon.
