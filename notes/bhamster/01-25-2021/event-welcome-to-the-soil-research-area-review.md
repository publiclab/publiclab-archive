Join us on a call to kick-off a [research area review on soil contamination](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/01-25-2021/research-area-review-on-soil-events) and be a part of this collaborative project. **If you've used or created accessible tools for detecting soil contaminants, we'd love to hear from you!**
<br>
  
WHEN: **Tuesday, Feb. 2, at 12 pm PT / 3 pm ET / 8 pm UTC** / [other time zones](https://everytimezone.com/s/3d535d50), during Public Lab's regularly-scheduled [Open Call](https://publiclab.org/wiki/open-call).

WHAT: Come to talk about what we'll be doing over the next two months on the topic of soil contamination, and **how you can participate**!
