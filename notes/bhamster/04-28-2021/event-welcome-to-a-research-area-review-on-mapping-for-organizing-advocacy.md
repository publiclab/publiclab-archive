Join us on an open community call to kick-off a [research area review on mapping for organizing and advocacy](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/04-27-2021/research-area-review-on-mapping-for-organizing-and-advocacy). **Have you created maps or aerial imagery to mobilize people around a local environmental issue?** We'd love to hear from you!

**WHEN**: **Tuesday, May 11, at 12pm PT / 3pm ET / 7pm UTC** / [other time zones](https://everytimezone.com/s/16c7835d), during Public Lab's regularly-scheduled [Open Call](https://publiclab.org/wiki/open-call).

**WHERE**: We'll meet on Zoom. <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/934187763?pwd=eVRFMHJ2UmlRZ3lwZnIwZ3dhWk5iZz09">Click here to join Zoom meeting</a>

**WHAT**: We'll meet each other and exchange our initial questions and challenges for this topic, and figure out how we can collectively grow knowledge and skills towards community organizing and advocacy using mapping as a key step. We'll talk about what we'll do over the next two months of the review, and **how you can participate**! [More details on the research area review are here](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/04-27-2021/research-area-review-on-mapping-for-organizing-and-advocacy).
