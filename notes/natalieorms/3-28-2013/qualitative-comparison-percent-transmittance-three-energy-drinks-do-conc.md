<strong>Motivation</strong>

The motivation for analyzing different energy drinks is to determine the relative amounts, if any, of red food coloring present in the liquid.  Of the three drinks tested, both Monster and Red Bull do claim to have some red food coloring present. Neurosonic, however, still has a slight red color but claims to not contain any red food coloring. Using the Public Lab Kit spectrometer we are able to obtain spectra of samples of all three drinks and compare the percent transmittance of red light for the three drinks. Comparison of the transmittance of red light of liquids with and without food coloring provides us with a qualitative idea of the amount of red food coloring present in each energy drink, relative to a beverage that contains similar active ingredients, but no food coloring.

<strong>Method</strong>

A desktop spectrophotometer was assembled from the Public Lab Kit using the “Assembly Instructions” found at http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/dsk. Our group’s assembly of the instrument deviated from the protocol with respect to the removal of the IR filter from the digital camera lens; rather than removing the lens from the mount to access the filter, we found that upon heating the plastic, the filter could be removed more readily from the underside of the lens. This method of removal increased the efficiency of our assembly, and should be utilized for future constructions of the instrument.

A 7-mL sample of classic Red Bull, Monster Assault, and Neurosonic, respectively, was added to a clean, glass test tube and capped. The percent transmittance of each sample was recorded while the sample was held at a minimum distance from the instrument slit. An incandescent bulb served as the source for all of our experiments.

<strong>Materials</strong>

Desktop Public Lab Spectrometer Kit
Computer
Monster Assault energy beverage
Neurosonic energy beverage
Red Bull energy beverage
3 clean glass test tubes
Incandescent lamp

<strong>Analysis</strong>

The overlayed spectra can be viewed at http://spectralworkbench.org/sets/show/231

The Red Bull and Monster energy drinks show a much higher transmittance for red light than that of Neurosonic. Neurosonic has a relatively low and relatively uniform transmittance of light across the visible spectrum, although red light transmittance manifests relatively more intensely than other wavelengths. Since Neurosonic is a pink solution (see attached image of energy drink samples where the samples are, from top to bottom, Red Bull, Monster, and Neurosonic, respectively), this data makes sense. Monster Assault has a very high transmittance of red light that gradually decreases across the visible spectrum toward the green light, with nearly zero transmittance of the blue light. The Red Bull sample has two major peaks of transmittance at green light and at red light while gradually decreasing across the spectrum toward blue light. 

The Neurosonic energy drink can be used as a sort of baseline for the other two drinks due to the fact that Neurosonic does not have any red food coloring. In comparing the Red Bull to the Monster we can conclude that the Red Bull has a higher concentration of red food coloring. The transmittance of red light is much higher than that of the Monster. However, comparing the Monster to the baseline we can see that there is red food coloring present in a lesser concentration.
