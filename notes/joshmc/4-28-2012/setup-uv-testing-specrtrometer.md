Jeff Warren asked me to post some images of my setup for the UV spectra I posted on Spectral Workbench.  I'm having trouble getting the upload to work correctly, so I don't have a set including all the spectra from my tests.  Soon I'll probably just re-do the tests, but I'm waiting to get some more samples to test first.

Last night I used this setup to test UV passing through tap water, boiled tap water, All Free and Clear laundry detergent, and Clorox bleach.

Here are the spectra:

Update 8/12/12

Now that we dan download the CSV file for the spectra, I've imported the data for my UV tests into Excel, and have normalized each graph (each graph has the same total area under the curve, so they can be compared directly to each other.
