(As demonstrated by Public Lab)

---------

\* **Badges**: README badges - you can't miss them. Some community-oriented badges are `first-timers-only friendly`, `code of conduct`, `chat in different ways`, `newcomers welcome`, and the `contributions welcome` badge.

\* **Bots**: [Welcome bot](https://github.com/behaviorbot/welcome) especially.

\* **Chatroom**: have a chatroom, for example a [Gitter community](https://gitter.im/publiclab/publiclab "https://gitter.im/publiclab/publiclab").

\* **Cloud installation**: add support for cloud installation. They are platform agnostic, and downloading software isn't a requirement to contribute.

\* **Code community survey**: send out an optional, anonymous survey to your contributors at the end of the year to learn what works for them and what doesn't.

\* [**Code of conduct**](https://publiclab.org/conduct): just required.

\* [**Community Check-in**](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/master/doc/CHECKINS.md): have a weekly community check-in via a Github issue. Encourage any contributors to take the lead for the next week and open it.

\* **Contribution model**: implement a non-technical contributing workflow that sets the tone throughout your community. (See this post's main image).

\* **Contributor credit**: in releases, on your README, - wherever.

\* [**Contributors welcome page**](https://code.publiclab.org/#r=all)

\* **Emojis**: they're friendly.

**\* [FTOs](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-31-2016/create-a-welcoming-first-timers-only-issue-to-invite-new-software-contributors)**: (labels - `good first issue`, `first-timers-only`).

\* **[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)**: online IDE which simplifies code contributions and reviews by fully automating the dev setup. - Provides free open source plans!

\* **Groups**: collaboratively manage a repository, each focused in on a specific feature. Ex:

- `core-maintainers`
- `ui-maintainers`
- `tests-maintainers`
- `module-maintainers`

**\* Issue labels**: other useful issue labels: `add code links`, `help wanted`

\* **Noble cause**: choose a cause people want to get behind.

\* **Open Hour**: a community call scheduled monthly or weekly.

\* [**OSS Programs**](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/wiki/Open-Source-Programs): participate in OSS programs (Google Summer of Code (GSoC), Rails Girls Summer of Code (RGSoC), Outreachy, Google Code-In (GCI), and more).

\* **Social Media**: provide way for contributors to connect to your organization. Public Lab uses Twitter to thank new contributors for their 1st PR if they provide their Twitter handle.

\* [**Supportive Tasks**](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/wiki/Supportive-Tasks): Public Lab's supportive tasks improve the quality of issues for newcomers, encourage a cycle of reciprocity in the community, and engage non-code contributors. Amongst other things.

\* [**Teams**](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/11-08-2016/help-public-lab-s-software-grow-by-joining-a-supportive-team "https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/11-08-2016/help-public-lab-s-software-grow-by-joining-a-supportive-team"): more broad than groups, contributors take on specific roles across the whole community. Ex:

- @publiclab/support
- @publiclab/mentors

\* **Templates**: make it easy for new contributors to follow your community conventions and workflow with pull request and issue templates.
