I am working a project called [The Appalachian Mountaintop Patrol](http://publiclab.org/notes/LauraChipley/09-25-2014/sensors-for-collecting-environmental-data-at-mtr-and-hydrofracking-sites) (AMP)  that collaborates with environmental activists in Boone, Raleigh and Kanawha counties to document the experience of living in close proximity to, and the environmental contamination caused by Mountaintop Removal.

We want to install [trail cameras](http://www.cabelas.com/category/Trail-Cameras-Accessories/103867380.uts) near MTR sites to document blasting, record activity and chronicle how sites change over time. We are interested in the possibility of hacking one of these cameras to activate at least 2 minutes of video recording upon detecting a loud sound (a loud siren goes off before a blast). 

Questions: Does anyone in the PL community have an idea as to how we could go about this? Can anyone suggest an alternative to hacking a trail camera?

Thanks everyone!

For those who are interested, here are some links to drone documentation of a permit near the Kanawha Forest and of the Brushy Fork impoundment, that sits directly above the town of Eccles in Raleigh County.
