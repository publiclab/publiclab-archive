I'm working to develop a new project called Appalachian Mountaintop Patrol (AMP).

The Appalachian Mountaintop Patrol (AMP) is a collaborative, environmental watchdog multimedia education initiative that will train people in Boone County, WV to document environmental contamination resulting from coal / natural gas extraction in the Appalachian Mountains. Using small waterproof video cameras and environmental testing kits, AMP participants will take water quality measurements and film runoff from hydraulic fracturing and mountaintop removal (MTR) wastewater ponds that seep into local waterways. ‘Deer cams’ (motion activated hidden cameras used to track game) will be installed to monitor suspected gas well chemical dumping sites. Participants will also use drones equipped with cameras and air quality sensors to shoot video, gather GPS coordinates and measure environmental data in remote hydrofracking and MTR sites.  Additionally, AMP participants will record “video diaries” to illustrate the everyday experience of living in close proximity to environmental contamination.

Next steps:
This project will be a collaboration between people with diverse skill sets and backgrounds, including film/video, sociology, geography, mechanical engineering and environmental justice. I am looking to connect with potential collaborators working in environmental science, environmental toxicology and those who have experience flying drones.

Questions:
What kind of environmental sensors would be useful (and user-friendly for citizen scientists) for collecting data at Mountaintop Removal or Hydrofracking sites? (measuring air, water, soil quality)?
