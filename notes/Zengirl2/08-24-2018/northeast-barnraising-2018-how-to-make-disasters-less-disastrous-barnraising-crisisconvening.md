This Northeast regional Barnraising was like no other because it started with people exchanging stories
of disaster. It was an appropriate ice breaker since the first day was dedicated
to crisis convening. I shared my experience of an earthquake that hit while
I was at a caf√© in Philadelphia. I remember my inner dialogue went from "possible
subway work" to "nearby construction" to the gut instinct that this was an
earth shaking event. How much time did I lose arguing with myself? What would I do differently next time? As
others shared their encounters questions arose: How many people have
experienced natural disasters? What does emergency relief look like? What should
it look like?

It's hard to compare a small
earthquake that merely puts people on edge, to a hurricane with flooding that
causes loss of homes, jobs, food and electricity. Testimonies from flood
survivors, (who I'm now renaming flood wranglers) provided details of rising
waters and destruction in so many communities---New Jersey, Texas, Florida, El
Salvador and Puerto Rico. I know I was swept by the emotions of sadness, fear
and anger hearing about their situations. Yet there were also stories of
community leaders, bartering and rebuilding that brought hope. After another
day of Barnraising, the stories started to sound similar. In fact, you could
have exchanged locations and faces, but the same problems were surfacing.

- People were not
being helped
- Governments were
failing to respond efficiently (or not at all)
- Communications
failed
- Systems were not
in place for food and water

The greatest thing about a
Barnraising is that it not only provides a safe place to discuss problems, but
it also encourages sharing current solutions while working on new ones. One of
the best tools I heard presented was the common bicycle. They can be
used for transporting supplies and medical aids, as they are
nimble when most roads are jammed or impassible. Bikes are also able to be
hacked to become generators to recharge phones--that's something everyone
should have in place!![image description](/i/26344.jpg "NEWTable.JPG")

One of the sessions that got
me most excited was creating a "Communication Checklist". Solid ideas were put
on paper about the best ways to communicate during a disaster when electricity
fails. Details include using flyers with bold/cultural images to communicate
meeting places and times, connecting with community leaders, using libraries as
hubs, encouraging face-to-face communication and supplying printouts of
resources.![image description](/i/26345.jpg "RFP2.jpg")

Choices of resources are
often not controlled by communities, and one session addressed that problem by
creating a blueprint for a Rapid RFP (Request for Proposal). It includes a
transition/handoff plan, deliverables, timeline and transparent budget. This
entire process would help to ensure that a community receives the right help it
needs and would also put into place a checks and balances for how the process
is working out.

Checks and balances is
probably just the shadow of what I encountered on this Barnraising. The most
memorable part was hearing quavering voices as truths were shared across all
disasters including government mistrust, racism, receiving inappropriate supplies,
neglect, hunger, sickness and homelessness. Still
these discussions are so fresh in my mind and I'm so thankful for those that
were able to stand up in front of the group and be so honest. We need to hear
this---the world needs to hear this. So, what can we do to make disasters less
disastrous? Here's what I learned so far:

- Start making
connections with your community now to prepare---leaders and resources
- Despite mistrust,
we must work to communicate with government so they become partners
- Have a plan of
action for your household and family members including supplies
- If disaster
strikes a community other than your own, make sure you are invited to help by the community or from a trusted resource of that community. The history of the community is an important consideration and a great example can be found on [this post about the situation in Puerto Rico](https://publiclab.org/notes/joyofsoy/08-28-2018/show-you-can-be-free-in-a-colony#10/18.0000/-66.0000).
- Money doesn't
solve the problem in larger disasters---be ready to barter and share
- Use the
connections made at Barnraising to boost our network and join to help

We cannot
escape that all things are interconnected and I know that I'm still learning
how to ask for and accept help. For those that attended the Barnraising, please do
add in your thoughts on what you learned or what could be helpful in a
disaster. I remain in awe of flood wranglers and those serving in disasters.
