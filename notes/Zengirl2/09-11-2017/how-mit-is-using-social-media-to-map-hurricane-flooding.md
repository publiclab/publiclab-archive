MIT has created a platform to crowdsource flood information and map it according to a post on [The Verge][1]. It uses a chatbox to bring info from social media sources including Twitter, Facebook and Telegram. Created by MIT's Urban Risk Lab, [RiskMap](https://riskmap.us/) is a beta for Florida. 

> The goal is to provide up-to-date information on changing flood
> conditions from a large population of people. Presently, this test
> will only cover Floridaâ€™s Broward County, which is just north of
> Miami, and contains Fort Lauderdale

The platform has already been used in Indonesia and future plans include a similar platform for India.
