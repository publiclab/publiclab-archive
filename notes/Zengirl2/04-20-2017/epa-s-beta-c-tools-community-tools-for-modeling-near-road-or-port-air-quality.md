I just attended a webinar today from the EPA demoing their [C-Tools software](https://www.cmascenter.org/c-tools/) for modeling. For now they have two options: C-Line and C-Port.

  
**C-Line**

- Community Line Source Model
- Local air quality due to mobile sources in region
- Computes dispersion of primary mobile source pollutants using meteorological conditions for the region of interest  
- Can adjust variables for traffic type (diesel trucks), wind etc. for "what if" scenarios

  
**C-Port**

- Community modeling system for Near-Port
- Select port of interest
- Look at terminal pollution, rail, traffic, shipping lanes, ship docking locations, point-source emissions

  
It's meant for citizen science, so have fun exploring. **
