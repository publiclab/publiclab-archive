###What I want to do or know
I would like to know if it is possible to get a 3D map (orthomosaic) from using the balloon mapping method; like what you would get if you use a UAV/Drone (eBee, DJI Inspire). Or does the balloon mapping only create a flat 2D map without data on the terrain/topography?

###Background story
I work with an NGO, looking to map out villages of rural settlements in my country as a base for village development.
