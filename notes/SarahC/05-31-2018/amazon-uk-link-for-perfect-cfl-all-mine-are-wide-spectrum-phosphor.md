The lights I have that are still CFL and not LED are all streaked/wide spectrum lighting with undefined lines.

  
Look at this perfectly sharp one!

Mine looks like this - even with an eyepiece spectroscope I got from eBay:

As you can see the CFL has smeared blue lines. =(

  
I'd love to do a "One-click" on Amazon to get a CFL that has the very defined lines of cheap phosphor and bad filtering!

  
Please help!
