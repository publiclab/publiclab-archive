I have been trying to assemble the desktop spectrometer kit and had a few questions. I started off well , focusing the camera at a distance of 9" as shown in the figure below

I assembled the kit as per instructions and then to test the setup used a torch to shine light into the spectrometer I  had to shine the torch at various angles to get what is shown below

I am sure I am doing something wrong here . I had the following question . 
1) The slit for imaging seems to be off-center is that by design or have i done something wrong ? see picture below.

2) Is shining a torch is too weak a light source ? Need CFL or LED ? what is the minimum wattage of light source to be used ?

3) The DVD piece which I have used to create the grating had a lot of scratches is that what is causing a spectrum like this ? if this is the case how best can I get a new grating ? should i use DVD R ?
please let me know of your thoughts so that I can get going !

Thanks,
