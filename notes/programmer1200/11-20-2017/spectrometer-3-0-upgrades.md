# Spectrometer 3.0 Upgrades

Over the last month or so I had finally been able to sit down and start upgrading and building my Spectrometer 3.0\. Now the Spectrometer 3.0 is a great machine and was well designed but I had few changes and additions I wanted to add to it.The things I wanted to change are the mount that holds the camera and a cuvette holder that I could easily change the light sample.All the changes that I made are 3d printed and will be made available to anyone that would like to try them out.

  
The reason I changed the mounting method was I found the original mount to be not as fixed as I would like. It moved around and I had to re adjust the camera after moving it. So to fix this I designed the 65° and the 45° to be one piece, this eliminates the issue of them detaching from the Velcro. Now to keep this in back of the box I simply cut the piece of wood that Public Lab provided with the spectrometer and it kept it tightly in the back.

The next upgrade was the more complicated and time consuming but in the end it made the spectrometer extremely more useful because it allowed me to experiment with different water samples and oil samples. I could expose these samples to different specific spectrums and see what the results would be. For example I could take a sample of water from a local lake or river and do a comparison with a sample of distilled water. The adapter I built was formed around the spectrometer 3.0  and uses the cuvettes that Public Lab sells in their store. This adapter is held tightly to the spectrometer with four earth magnets in the spectrometer.

So far I built white led, UV, red laser, green laser modules. I thought they would come useful when examining different samples. If you anyone is interested in these upgrades i'll happily upload my files to thingiverse.
