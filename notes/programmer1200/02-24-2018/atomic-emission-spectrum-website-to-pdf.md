I've been very interested in finding trace elements in both water and air samples using the spectrometer and its good to have a the spectrum for each element so you can do comparison to the results of the spectrometer. Penn State has an interactive website with a periodic table that you can hit each element and it will bring up the spectrum.Although this is very useful , you have to connected to the internet to interact with it , their is no download option or offline option. So to solve this issue I downloaded the entire content of the website and brought this information to a PDF form where each spectrum is labeled with the Element. I hope some people find this useful.
