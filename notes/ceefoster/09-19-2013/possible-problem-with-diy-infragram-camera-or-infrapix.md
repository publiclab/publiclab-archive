I've been working with an Infragram camera that was made following the instructions on the website, and originally it appeared to work fine. However, I've noticed that in recent photos some of the buildings are colored like they living. 

I attached the image that I'm getting on the infrapix web app. The building is appearing in the green, which seems to be incorrect, but the sky and road are blue. There is hardly any differentiation among all of the plants. 

I also looked at the blue and red channel images that are generated, and the red channel correctly appears brighter than the blue channel, so I would say that the camera is functioning as it should. 

Is the camera functioning as it should? Why is the building green? Why is there little differentiation? I've also been using the ImageJ plugin and the colors seem skewed there as well. 

I can post more photos if needed. 

Thanks in advance for any help.
