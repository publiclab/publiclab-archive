cfastie posted an [important note about where infra blue photography needs to go](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/07-17-2013/infrablue-minutiae) and it got me thinking about viewing the different multispectral images together; I prefer an overlay environment. The following js slider approach seems to do this well 
 
[classycompare](http://www.class.pm/projects/jquery/classycompare/) 

The examples seem to work with touch screens, but only through tapping instead of sliding with the pointer on a pc/desktop. Perhaps there is a better solution for getting this functionality going. I dont think this site will currently support classycompare without some implementation but I really wanted to look at the nice example in overlay so lined these up really fast and made a gif.
