Oblique aerial panorama of the 2013 Berkeley Kite Festival at César Chávez Park. This was taken on Saturday(7/28) morning at around 10:30AM. We setup for the photography by facing East with San Francisco to our back and flying from beyond where all of the other kites were flying. We used both of the [Public Lab delta kites](http://store.publiclab.org/collections/mapping/products/kite-mapping-pack). People are still arriving to the event at this time, shuttling in on busses from Golden Gate Fields across the water. The annual festival is a great way to learn about kites with lots of demonstrations and tons of friendly kite flyers.
