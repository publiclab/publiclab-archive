Using this small tripod I had a very easy time pointing my camera in a consistent direction.

I simply wrapped the line around the tripod while open and closed it on the line and then used the velcro wrap to seal it tight. The line is looped around the top of the tripod joints in a way that prevents it from sliding along the line. It was easy to observe and test/adjust the angle of the ball mount at low altitude before flying higher. There is no stabilization here, but I had no trouble taking sharp images because the kite line is fairly ridged while flying. I had a very small amount of lateral back and forth sway from the kite which actually helped produce a panorama with a wider angle.
