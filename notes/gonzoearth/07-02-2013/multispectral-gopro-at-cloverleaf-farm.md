I ran dual image pairs (vis/nir) through Ned Horning's [Photo Monitioring ImageJ Plugin](https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin) from the [flight at Cloverleaf Farmstand in Davis, CA.](http://publiclab.org/notes/MicheleTobias/06-04-2013/farm-mapping-at-cloverleaf-farmstand-davis-ca)

I am pleased with the default NDVI imagery produced, however I am getting some ghosting with the NRG output. The cameras were in the same plane and just inches away from each other but enough  offset to cause the issue. I would like to experiment with preparing an image pair through manual overlay and crop before running through the plugin to see how that works out.
