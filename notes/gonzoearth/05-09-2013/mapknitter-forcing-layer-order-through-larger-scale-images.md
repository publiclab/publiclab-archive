MapKnitter currently has automated control over the layer ordering of the output mosaic. Order is determined by image extent size from back to front.

In this map I wanted to include the image of the mappers in a circle pattern on the ground. At first MapKnitter did not want to show the image in favor of a different image in the same scene that had a different angle. So, the image was cropped, giving it a smaller extent, and moving it to the top of the resulting output map and image mosaic.
