Public Lab organizer <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/people/patcoyle">Pat Coyle</a> recently <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/map/arroyo-mocho-neighborhood-livermore-california/2012-12-26">posted winter update</a> to a <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/map/arroyo-mocho-neighborhood-livermore-ca/2011-10-08">map of the Arroyo Mocho neighborhood</a> in Livermore California. You can use the map viewer to go fullscreen and look at the different maps together from the different times of the year. 
The link for fullscreen mode is at the top right of the map viewer, with the button to open layers just below. Here the December map is selected with the October maps beneath. The other map at the bottom is nearby but not within overlay of this neighborhood.
Right now you cannot rearrange the layer order or change the base map. We will continue to develop the Public Lab map viewer and archive in the new year.
