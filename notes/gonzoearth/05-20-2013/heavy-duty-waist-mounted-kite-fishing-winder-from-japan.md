Seeing a [note fromSeanKMcGinnis](http://publiclab.org/notes/SeanKMcGinnis/05-16-2013/line-reel-for-balloon-kite-string) on using an electrical cord winder reminded me of the of the really nice heavy duty line winder that Alex Mandel got from Japan. It is waist mounted and has a large winder with nice action on it.
