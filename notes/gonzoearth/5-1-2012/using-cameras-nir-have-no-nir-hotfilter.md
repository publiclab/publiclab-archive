for the [NIR imaging tool](http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/near-infrared-camera) project Chris Hillcox of http://balloonnews.wordpress.com/ and others have asked about using consumer cameras that do not have the NIR hotfilter installed to begin with rather than removing it as seen with the Canon Powershot. Apparently the GoPro Hero 2 does not come with the filter installed. The setup is different and out there for experimentation.
