This map was made from a vertical balloon flight where the camera did not move horizontally around the scene. It is important to use the ground level as the common denominator when registering the imagery. 

Discrete images were selected for their particular field of view on each building within the scene in an attempt to achieve a seamless map while allowing for distortion to occur on all of these tall buildings.
