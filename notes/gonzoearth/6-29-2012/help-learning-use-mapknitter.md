Get help learning how to use Mapknitter. the MapKnitter guide is found here http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/mapknitter

Have any questions about using the tool? We can go online with you over Skype and demonstrate how it works. If you have your own aerial images, we can use them. If you do not have any images but want to learn that is fine as well.
