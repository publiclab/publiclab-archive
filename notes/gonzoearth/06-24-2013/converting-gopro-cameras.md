I started collecting notes on modifying gopro cameras [here on this wiki page](http://publiclab.org/wiki/gopro-cameras). 
The platform seems very promising and appears to be quite easy to disassemble, however there is not very much documentation on the OEM multi-element lens. 
Still trying to sort out if it can be modified in place, or if a separate lens altogether needs to be used.
