Posting this tardy but I had a really good time flying kites at the annual Berkeley Kite festival with fellow Public Lab members MicheleTobias, Alex Mandel, and Alex Stoicof. Special thanks to Pat Coyle for letting me use his gear. The enormous kites that you see here are either tethered to trucks or heavy duty ground station/stakes. Funny  flying teddy bear kite in the background of the lead image.
