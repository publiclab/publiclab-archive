**This Week in Public Laboratory** 
Plenty of action this week including a new balloon kit, flame spectroscopy, a prototype rasberry-pi based dual camera, and a community feedback survey. 

**New Balloon Kit 1.5 UPDATE**
“As of today, we've changed up the balloon kit parts to address concerns and improvements. Its a better kit with more stuff for the same price!”

**Classroom Flame Spectroscopy**
From Public Lab member Straylight: “A group of students and I put the PLOTS spectroscope to use observing the spectra from solutions of common metal salts that were excited in the flame of a bunsen burner.”
