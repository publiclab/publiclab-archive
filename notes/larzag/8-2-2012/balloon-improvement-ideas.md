does it make sense to borrow some ideas from the folks that make these "air swimmers"?

Example: The AirSwimmer's body is made from a high-quality, durable nylon material that will stay inflated for weeks and can be refilled over and over again. 

also, use of Ultra Hi-Float Balloon Treatment - 16 oz. to extend the life of the balloon.
