_WIP_

This research note comes at the crossroads of the following works:

- Exposing The Invisible, [Bio-Investigation](https://kit.exposingtheinvisible.org/en/what/bio-investigation.html%29)
- [Hack2Eaux](https://wiki.kaouenn-noz.fr/hors_les_murs:hack2eaux), Kaouenn Noz Biohackerspace
- [Home Testing for Endocrine Disruptors](https://publiclab.org/wiki/environmental-estrogen-testing), PublicLab

You can also find a wiki page in Pubic Lab: "[Bioassay](https://publiclab.org/wiki/bioassay)"

## Purpose

The aim is to compile the available scientific resources on "seed bioessay tests" concerning water (tap water, river water, construction site runoff); to operate a scientific mediation to make this knowledge available to as many concerned people as possible; and finally, to design and make available a "home self-testing" protocol that is effectively reproducible and can be implemented with "the basic equipment available in a kitchen"⋅

> **Materiality concerns**:
> 
> Publishing methods, plans, protocols under a free and open source license is not enough to facilitate the learning of a solution.  
> The materiality conditions, i.e. the availability of materials, the costs of these materials, the logistics of supply; access to the internet¹ and all other difficulties must be considered as serious development factors.
> 
> A person living in a Western European city can have a supermarket, a pharmacy, a school or university, a DIY store within a geographical radius of less than 10km; as well as a sufficient minimum income allowing him/her to spend several tens of euros without threatening his/her diet or access to healthcare.  
> This situation is not a common standard for all people, neither in Europe nor elsewhere in the world¹.
> 
> Therefore, we consider that a proposed solution that does not consider these factors seriously is not a free solution, nor a viable solution.

## Protocol

### Materials

### Culture medium

> **Tips!** Germination rate gives a good indication of several contaminants
> including salt and chlorine. Make agar plates using the water and grow.
> One issue is high nitrogen is bad for us but good for plants so
> confounding variable

### Germination

### Observation

### Do documentation!

### Interpretation
