 Come and collect seeds in a corner of Rennes, Brittany, France.

We make them germinate: in water, but also in other substrates that inspire us, that seem interesting to observe, that we think could influence the taste of things. We observe, we let it happen, we taste (if possible), we note, and we try to learn and we do not take ourselves too seriously.

We will stroll, we will discuss, we will spot plants, “ blooming crops and weeds” in our neighborhood. We will above all take care of our socialities.
And some plants have seeds, and some seeds can be used in your kitchen, from 7 to 107 years. And even some of these seeds can be used to help identify the presence of heavy metals and/or endocrine disruptors in water and soil. 

> This is a common thread of this workshop:
Coming together and engaging in shared responsibilities on issues of water and soil quality, heavy metals, endocrine disruptors, PFAS, and how solutions are being knit together in solidarity fragility down the road from you.

**Louzaouiñ**

Verb in Breton language which means to treat, to bandage, phytosanitary, to cure, etc. (a disease, or to treat with a phytosanitary product)

It is already a fight to reappropriate our language, which was once forbidden and denigrated, and it is a pleasure to be involved in the vivacity of a culture. 

 Some scientists call this “Bioassay”. We are yokels and we don't speak well, we say removing “Louzoù” and then we do “Louzaouiñ”.

The use of plant seeds to investigate pollutants in water (and mapping of these plants at the same time), with also, in addition to knowledge reappropriation and investigation, sessions with animations in critical education method and sessions of BioFabbing, that is to say writing fiction while doing counter biology.

**When**

+ **Monday 24 to Saturday 29 October 2022**

Like the countertop in ugly café, it will be both a space for sociability, but also a space for tasting. For this, we will use the methods used for tasting wines, coffees, teas, honey, breads, depending on what speaks to us the most.

If this is not accessible to the most deprived and the most dominated, then it is neither radical nor revolutionary!

A “worksite” on the issue of water and soil pollution dealt with by the people who have their feet in those soils and waters.

For example, 1 week to, starting from scratch, make and write recipes, replicable in the kitchen by our grandmothers and very young without pre-established genre, from seeds of plants of the corner that we make germinate in water, then just photos and measure to the school rules of the roots.
A bit like a salad thought, picked, cooked, passed on, together.
