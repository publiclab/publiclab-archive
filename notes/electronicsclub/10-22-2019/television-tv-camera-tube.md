A **TV camera tube** may be called the eye of a TV system. A **TV camera tube **is a transducer that converts the variations of light intensity into the variation of electrical current or voltage, known as **video signals**. 

## Basic Principle of Camera Tube

An **optoelectrical converter** is used to translate brightness variations into an electrical picture signal. Different converter systems are available, but only pickup tubes with a 
photosensitive semiconductor layer are really important for TV 
technology.   

Any picture appears to be composed of small elementary areas of light or
shade, which are known as picture elements. The elements thus contain 
the visual image of the scene. The purpose of a TV pick-up tube is to 
sense each element independently and develop a signal in electrical form
proportional to the brightness of each element. Light from the scene is
focused on a photosensitive surface known as the image plate, and the 
optical image thus formed with a lens system represents light intensity 
variations of the scene. By making use of photoelectric properties, the 
image plate then converts different light intensities into corresponding
electrical variations.
