I got the new NDVI modified lens, but cannot get it into focus. If I 
screw it tight against the body of the camera, it's still too long. If I
open the camera body and place the lens inside the body, it is too 
short. The sweet spot would seem to be right where it cannot be.   

  
Here's the lens screwed in place, snugly against the camera body,  and a very blurry landscape.

Here is the same landscape with the original Mobius lens and a red filter in place:

Here is a better placement of the lens, but it should be a bit further out to give a sharp focus.

Finally here is the Mobius model involved:

I guess something has changed between models, as it's not possible to get the lens into a position where the focus would be sharp. I could cut parts of the plastic case off to make more room for the lens, but that would not seem like a good idea.
