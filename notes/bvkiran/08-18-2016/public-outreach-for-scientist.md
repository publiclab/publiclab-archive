We are lauching a new startup Pepperscience.com 

All guest are invited for the launch of our startup

      I am Dr Kiran, member of PepperScience.com. PepperScience is a new startup based on the belief that at present, science becomes more and more about climbing corporate career ladders and less and less about interesting journeys of the mind, so the public's distrust of scientists and their work seems to grow. 
      This alienation of general public from active participation from research has been source of inspiration to start an alternative platform, through which public can influence researchers to respond to the interests and needs of society.
      Our startup pepperscience is trying to solve this problem by creating a common platform for research community, fellow researchers and public to share new research advancements in research in the form of  laysummaries  and with ZERO BURDEN on the researcher!!!

It is based on core-principles of public participation, open access and meaningful research. 

That said, here it is your invite to Pepper Science - private beta.
