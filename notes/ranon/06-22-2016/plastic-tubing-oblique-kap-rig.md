###LDPE Tubing Rig

The design for this KAP rig came out of experimenting with low density polyethylene (LDPE) tubing to create a low cost DIY rig.

###Prototype

The current prototype uses four circular 3D printed spools which allow the camera platform to rotate up and down. 

###Continuing Development

A second spool is currently in development which will have notches to allow for incremental adjustments to the camera angle. Also in development is a method for attaching a shaft to the top tube or rod which can be used to connect a pendulum or picavet.

###Update 6/24

The top tube now has a joint to connect a picavet or pendulum,

also two gear shaped spools allow for incremental camera angle adjustment. The longer slot shaped spool allows the camera to be mounted further back to improve balance.

The current challenge is determining a structure that will protect against significant impact drops. I am experimenting with 5, 6, and 7 pointed outer spools to attach different lengths of tubing.
