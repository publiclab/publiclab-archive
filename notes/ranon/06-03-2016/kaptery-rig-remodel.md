###Why I'm here

Hi! 

My name is Ranon and I am an Autodesk intern here at Public Lab's Portland location for the summer. I will be working on low cost solutions to kite, balloon, and pole aerial photography camera rigs. If you all could give me feedback on what you'd like to see from me while I'm here, I'd love to hear from you!

###Redstone Kaptery Remodel

I have started out by remodeling the Redstone KAP rig designed by Chris Fastie using Autodesk Fusion 360. Using this workflow, I was able to rapidly replicate and make modifications to the existing model, as well as insert hardware components using CAD files downloaded from the McMaster-Carr product library.

###Saturn V Kaptery Exploded Model

I am also working on an exploded model of the Saturn V Kaptery rig, complete with  hardware that can be identified via product code in Fusion 360 and ordered on the McMaster-Carr product library. Hopefully by including all of the components in the rig, this model can be used to create a set of clear instructions for assembling the kit.
