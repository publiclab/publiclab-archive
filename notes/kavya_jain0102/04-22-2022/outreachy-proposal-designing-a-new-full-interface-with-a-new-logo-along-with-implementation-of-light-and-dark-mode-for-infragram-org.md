## Project description

_Infragram.org is a web-based tool for analyzing plants that help with near-infrared photography. It helps to improve the environmental impacts and helps the users to assess crops and the efficacy of agriculture practices. This project aims to redesign the user interface of Infragram. To make it more attractive and accessible for the users along with improving the UI/UX. This can be done by adding new features such as refurbishing the UI for better serviceability, A new logo, A proper header and footer, a  cross-browser drag and drop feature, etc._

### Abstract/summary (<20 words):

_Designing a New Full Interface with a New Logo along with Implementation of Light and Dark Mode for Infragram.org._  

_  
_

_  
_

### Problem

- _Starting from the very top, a new logo can be proposed for the Infragram tool as it seems very simple and regular.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        __![image description](/i/46431.png "Logo.png")_
- __Improper spacing on the toolbar due to which it is occupying a large space on the webpage. Also, the toolbar is found to be irresponsive.                                                                                                                                           ____![image description](/i/46432.png "Toolbar.png")______
- __The webpage lacks an organized header that is found in general websites these days.                                        ![image description](/i/46433.png "Header.png")__

_  
_

- __The description of the Infragram tool is missing. The user news to switch the tabs to read and know more about the tool.    ________![image description](/i/46434.png "Description_missing.png")__

_  
_

- __Guide through whether users can construct or buy their own modded cameras.__

![image description](/i/46438.png "Guide.png")_  
_

  
_  
_

- __The existing interface mentions the steps on the image area which disappear on clicking. This might cause the users to perform multiple clicks. A proper list of tasks is not provided._  
_

![image description](/i/46436.png "Steps.png")

  
_  
_

- __It lacks a collection section where users can get a pile of clicked images at one stop.__

_  
_

- __A community section can add more weightage and attraction so that the users can have discussions, ask queries, seek or get help along with keeping a track of upcoming activities. _  
_

![image description](/i/46441.png "Community.png")_  
_

  
_  
_

- __A drag, drop, or upload feature must be there so that the users can even analyze the health of plant images already saved on their devices.__

_  
_

- _The workflow of Infragram to it should be added so that the users get a better understanding of its internal working. _

_  
_

- __A proper footer can help the users connect with the organization through various social media handles or even connect with the contributors and community through the chatroom._  
_

![image description](/i/46443.png "Footer.png")_  
_

  
_  
_

- _E__xceptional users cannot recognize differences due to their low vision. Therefore proper color combinations can make it more offering for each and every user. Some color contrast can be improvised along with adding buttons with the help of bootstrap._

![image description](/i/46444.png "Description_missing.png")_  
_

  
_  
_

- _Using labels for the specialized people inside the source code is important so that they can recognize what that logo implies and what is its purpose._![image description](/i/46445.png "labels.png")

  
  
### Project GoalsDesigning a New Full Interface for Infragram  

**  
**

The existing interface looks simple and regular. To improve its UI/UX, the following changes can be made along with adding new features to it -

### Experience

_In my first year of under graduation, I entered the world of open source through Hacktoberfest and GirlScript Winter Of Code'21\. Since then my journey has always been very enjoying and offering. I believe in the fact that one should always contribute to the open-source. Being an open-source enthusiast, I have participated in several open-source programs such as GWoC'21, SWoC'21, Hacktoberfest'21, Diversion, etc. I had bagged Second  Position in __GirlScript Winter Of Code'21, all over India in the domain C/C++._

_These programs have helped me learn, contribute and deal with the errors. Open-source taught me patience and confidence in myself._

_I am familiar with web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have developed several mini-projects during my learning. Apart from that, I am also focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms in C++. I primarily code in programming languages like C++ and Java. I am proficient in Content Writing and UI/UX Designing. I'm extremely inspired by the things around me that help me to build amazing interfaces for websites. _

_I developed a real-world application using Full stack Development. Apart from that, I'm good at writing Technical Documentation and easily understandable code._

_All my projects can be found here:  __[https://github.com/ikavyajain](https://github.com/ikavyajain)_

_I am comfortable using Linux and Windows, version control using git, and Visual Studio Code (for every other language) as my default editor due to the large repository of extensions they feature._

---------

### Teamwork

_I have actively participated in group projects and hackathons in teams. I enjoy meeting new people and learning from them. While I have been actively contributing on Github since last year, I have encountered several difficulties but lack the ways to approach help but now thanks to Public Lab, I can seek help from the mentors. This mentorship will help me step forward through my Technical journey. I believe in the fact that together we can achieve more and love to work in teams, therefore in the past few years, I had incorporated Teamwork skills in myself. I would love to efficiently contribute to Public Lab and its other open-source projects after this Program as well. I think as much as I contribute to the open-source as much I learn, grow, and explore._  

---------

### Passion

_I'm an enthusiastic and social person who loves to work with utmost dedication and aspire to become a role model for my peers. I have always been fascinated by Open source contributions and their offerings. I love to contribute to countless Open-Source projects and learn from them as I grow. Public Lab is one such organization that severs the best tools for the users and I'll be grateful to contribute to uplifting the project by designing a new interface for it. Open-Source is a means of sharing source code online and globally so that anyone is free to modify and update it for the betterment of society. Public Lab is a means through which I can learn and contribute to user-friendly tools like Infragram. The community is really appreciable and helpful. The contributors can ping anytime regarding any queries without any second thought. The solution to it is provided with minimal or no time. Working in Teams and learning from fellow applicants is another reason I love this community. I would love to connect and be a part of this amazing community in the future and will be a constant contributor to Public Lab._  

### Audience

This project is aimed to redesign a new full interface for [Infragram.org](http://infragram.org/) at Public Lab, which will help to meet the environmental needs of gardeners, farmers, environmental activists, researchers, conservationists, etc. It will help the users to analyze plant health with their Do-It-Yourself Kit so that they can assess crops and the efficacy of [agriculture](https://publiclab.org/tag/agriculture) practices. The near-infrared feature of this affordable camera also helps in wetland analysis and knowing the management of soil and fertilizers to improvise their treatments.

### Commitment

_I shall be working full-time on the source code and the improvement of the interface on weekdays (Monday to Friday) and will be able to work 40+ hours a week. My active hours would usually be between 10 AM IST (4:30 AM UTC) to 2 AM IST the next day (8:30 PM UTC). It'll be convenient for me to work anytime during these hours of the day. I'll assure you that there will be no absences, I'll actively contribute to the community as well as the projects. Apart from that, I'll completely stick to my commitments and the decided timeline. If any changes will be added, I'll work extra hours._

_My new session begins around the first week of August but that will never be a negative impact as I'll be attending that for a maximum of 2-3 hours so it won't be a hurdle during my internship period. I will not have any examinations during this period. Also, I've managed my tasks and timeline in an efficient manner to wrap up and complete the interface with additional changes within respected time. Therefore, I will surely have sufficient time to stick to my commitments._
