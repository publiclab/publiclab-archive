## Project description
I would love to work on email notification overhaul. The project was opened in 2014 and nobody has ever since taken up the issue. Some of the features that I would love to work on include:
- Reply by email to comments.

Main problem is that the application does not have a means of communication for users. They have to communicate through Google groups.

## Needs
I need the following resources:
- Guidance of a mentor.
- Internet connection.
- Documentation

## Setup
I have already forked and set up all the resources needed to get me going on my local machine.
The link to the repository is: https://github.com/mridulnagpal/plots2

## Experience

How I have learned about writing software; 
I was first exposed to writing code in a three-month boot camp between May- August 2016.
I have been improving my skills through writing projects, contribution to open source software, teaching my fellow coursemates, going through code tutorials and documentation and also participating in quizzes such as Code Wars.

**Contributions to Public Lab:**
I have already familiarized myself with the welcome page and so far these are the contributions I have made:
https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/commits?author=StlMaris123
https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/1357#issuecomment-289909995

## Teamwork
I have worked with Agile Ventures team, Lake Hub team and my course mates during group project. Working in teams(especially Agile Ventures) has boosted myself confidence a great deal, I am comfortable asking questions and interacting with other team members. Working with deadlines has also helped me to be more organized and more sufficient. 

##Passion
Public Lab is a great project that  provides a platform on which I can enhance my skills. Looking forward to being  steps closer to a senior developer by the end of the internship. The community at public is very supportive and friendly and I would like to continue working with them.

## Audience
This project will have a great impact on the end users. They will have the power of choosing the platform on which they would wish to be notified such as comments, subscriptions or likes. They also donâ€™t have to visit the website in order to reply to their comments as they can do this over the email. This will making it more welcoming and friendly to the users.

##Commitment
I do  understand this is a serious commitment, equivalent to a full-time summer job. I do pledge my full time commitment to the above project till the end .
