I'm working on a pro-bono project to improve the user experience on Public Lab's site. I've spent some time in the past few weeks learning about and evaluating the Questions page for ways to improve the UX/UI. 

  
I typically like to have a small set of research/design questions that I refer to throughout the design process. Looking at the Questions page, here are a few guiding thoughts:

  
1\. Assuming that a user's goal on this page is to (1) ask a question, (2) answer a question, or (3) explore the discussions, how does the page facilitate (or slow down) these goals?

2\. Can the page be reframed to give askers more agency over the discussion?

3\. On what other pages are the questions relevant, and in what context should they be embedded?

  
I used Mural, a brainstorming and collaboration tool, to create a virtual board of questions/comments about the UX:

I also checked out design patterns on analogous sites. I looked at Stack Overflow, Quora, Slack (asynchronous chat), Reddit (threading), and Instructables for common, intuitive experiences in discussion-based domains.  

  
In the next couple of weeks, I'll be ideating and sketching some ideas for features/layouts that will address some of these comments.
