The camera I received in my kit is different than the one shown in the assembly. It appears to be working when I plug it into my laptop, and the scale is normal, but when I try to calibrate with the fluorescent bulb, I can only get one half of the spectrum to show up. From one direction, the red, green, and yellow beams appear, and if I flip the camera 180, I see the blue side, but I can't make them appear at the same time. Suggestions?
