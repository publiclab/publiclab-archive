**Goodmorning everyone.
**
I am interested and following your research on NDVI.
I have written previously but then, because other problems, I could not deepen.
I bought a Point & Shoot Mobius with red filter and the parameters already properly set White Balance, from PublicLAB.
I want to get aerial imagery NDVI for agriculture.

I downloaded ImajeJ, followed all instructions and Photo Monitoring plugin installed.
Load the test image, and then from the Plugins menu, I select Photo Monitoring / single image processing from index
displayed image.
At this point it opens the "panel of doubts"

In the "Enter Variables" panel, which settings / values ​​I set? Which should I choose Index Type for calculation
suitable to my Mobius? What .Lut I choose?
.... So that panel Enter Variables, are driving me crazy!
Then help me figure out where to take the relative scale colors appear in the image?
I hope not to bore you too much with these problems by beginner and maybe to soon share some evidence
serious.
Attaching screenshoot and
