Hello everyone, I bought at publiclab , a Mobius with red filter Rosco # 19 and custom White balance , to have aerial photographs NDVI .

I did download of Fiji and added monitor plugin . I did some testing but I do not understand whether right or not .

Can you help me figure out the correct steps in Fiji to get to a NDVI image correct ? Thanks and forgive my English
