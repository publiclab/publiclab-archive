###What I want to do
**I want to get Aereal (UAV) prescription maps for precision farming**


###My attempt and results
As a first approach , I purchased in PublicLab , a Mobius Point & Shoot filter Wratten # 25red and a custom white balance.
Good compromise between lightness and result but slow too extreme for aerial mapping and too many problems in the shadows. Too many aberrations.
I recently changed a Canon Helf 130is with Kodak Wratten # 25 Red and made white balance ​​several tests.

SOME SHOOTS and ImageJ Outputs using NDVI_VGYRM Lut :

What do you think?
Some advice?
In the meantime, I purchased a Canon PowerShot SX260 HS , with GPS for the conversion .
In both Powershot , I installed CHDK ( http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK ) to have additional features such as INTERVALLOMETER and many other extra Canon features.
If I obtain satisfactory results , I will proceed to the flight test.
