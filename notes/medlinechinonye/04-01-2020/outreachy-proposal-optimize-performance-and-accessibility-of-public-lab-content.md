# **Problem**

This project will help to fasten the
performance and accessibility of Public Lab Content. This will make it
user-friendly, increase it's speed and also enable new comers use it so easily.
With the help of standards this will be achieved. As a fresher in the Public
lab site, it is difficult to know how to navigate through the site or to
understand the next step to take. The introduction of carousel, audio and video
contents and a well colored background site will be of great use. This project
will be classified into two steps:

**Step 1: Scanning the current Website and
Upgrading its Performance**

With
the help of webpagetest, the public lab website was examined, the waterfalls
showed a large number of js files, image and css files. The website can be
improved by creation of new and different files (css, js, images, html,etc.)
for past projects or years, deletion of unused files and compression of files
in-use for example using zip compressor. The Below is an image of the
webpagetest. The publiclab.org website can also be improved by including
carousel, audio or video sliders, frequently asked questions, pop-ups for the
Outreachy.org page for easy reach, a colorful landing page, pop-up or tags to
show a task to be done and the use of a better database management system such
that when one types, the likely word or most sought words appears.

**Step 2: Enhancing the
webpage for a user-friendly friendly experience**

To achieve this, the
webpage will allow a better format that allow major commands to be taken such
as increase in font size, change of font style, allowing users to print or save
in formats of their choice. Also, the public lab content will be modified in
such a way that allows out-going users comment on their experience. Creation of
a whatsapp or telegram social media handle to ease communication for public lab
members

# **My contribution to
Public Lab**

I have interest on environmental issues and
that is the reason I joined Public lab where I can use open source to solve
problems. I have made contributions to the Public lab and these are my pull
requests which have been merged.

# **Experience** I am an experienced teacher of Science. I am
also good at html and CSS. I am also good with js codes. 

  
****

# **Teamwork** After, my classes at the She-hacks coding boot
camp of February 2020, I have been able to teach over 5 girls and these girls
have thought others too.

As an Alumini of YALI Africa, I have joined
other members to educate the public especially girls on the importance of
quality education, good sanitary lifestyle and avoidance of early girl-child
marriage.

A big thanks to all my mentors at public lab
for their guidance and support.

# **Passion** I am passionate about
the environment, sounds and responses observed by positive and negative effects
on it.

****

# **Audience** This project will help
first timers on the public lab webpage to navigate through effortlessly. It
will also encourage a video or audio such that a newcomer lands on the page and
gets excited that he or she has learnt something new.
