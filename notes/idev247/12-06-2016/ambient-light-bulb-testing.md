###Situation
I’m looking to compare different types of light bulbs for brightness, and color range. An example light bulb would be the [Phiips Hue](http://www2.meethue.com/en-ca/productdetail/philips-hue-white-and-color-ambiance-starter-kit-a19)

###Main Question
Do you think the [Desktop Spectrometry Kit 3.0](https://publiclab.org/wiki/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0) would be able to measure the color spectrum of a lightbulb, and its brightness?

###Secondary Questions
* If the Desktop Spectrometry Kit does not work, do you know what relatively inexpensive tool type could be used?
* If it can measure brightness, will I be able to compare two light bulbs? (will webcam exposure change?)
* I was thinking of building a white box inside a black box to isolate ambient light. Good idea?

###Background story

I’m new to the spectrometer world. I did quite a bit of research but I'm still not sure what tool needs to be used. I think it might be a spectrometer based on what the 
[Sekonic C-700-U SpectroMaster Color Meter](http://www.sekonic.com/united-states/products/c-700-u/overview.aspx) does. For a personal project I definitely don't want to spend $1,000+ on this.
