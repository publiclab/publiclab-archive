###What I want to do
[Sean McGinnis](http://publiclab.org/profile/SeanKMcGinnis) and I wanted to share our experiences and enthusiasm for balloon mapping and the Public Lab.
###My attempt and results
We got on stage at Johnny Brenda's bar/restaurant in Philadelphia and talked for five minutes while slides changed behind us every 20 seconds. I think it went okay...[take a look](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQtwIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dr3kYhACkEn4&ei=Itw_VK2dDMKRgwTX_4DQCA&usg=AFQjCNEUAbpfoqlc2Py76JobI72ZD8kthA&sig2=IdWypEAc-ueJoT9415h5iA&bvm=bv.77648437,d.eXY)
###Questions and next steps
How can we transform this kind of talk into broader Public Lab participation?
###Why I'm interested
We wanted to more people to learn about the possibilities of the Public Lab.
