Excited to begin my project! This week I soldered pins to my Raspberry Pi and started to get familiar with the software. It was a bit overwhelming at first but I am feeling much more confident now that I have used it a couple of times. I pulled together some articles to begin putting together the idea for my project and started a document for my research proposal as well.
