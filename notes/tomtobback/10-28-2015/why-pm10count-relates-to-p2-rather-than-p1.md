Hi guys, thanks a lot for sharing your excellent project; I have a question related to the Dustduino code (i posted this question earlier on the 'sketches' page). I understand how you get to countP1 and countP2, but then you relate PM10count to P2 (number > 2.5micron) - i don't understand why it is not more accurate to say that PM10count relates to P1 (number > 1micron) because PM10 should include all the particles up to 10 micron. Is there a reason you use P2 for PM10? For PM25count i understand why you take P1 - P2. Would appreciate your comment- thanks- Tom
