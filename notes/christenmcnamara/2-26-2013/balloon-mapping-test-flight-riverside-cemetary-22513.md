Date: Monday, February 25, 2013
Time: 9:00am
Location: Riverside Cemetery, Asheville, NC
Riverside Cemetery is a National Historic Site, located in downtown Asheville, NC on 73 Acres of beautiful rolling hills.
Weather:  Overcast & winds at 6-11 mph
Cameras: Cannon 10 megapixel & Nikon 17 megapixel
Who: City of Asheville GIS Analysts - Scott Barnwell & Corey White; Adam Griffith from PLOTS and WCU; myself - Christen McNamara from NCSU-Student and City of Asheville.

Mission: to collect aerial images for the Riverside Cemetery Mapping Project.  

Yesterday's Launch was a practice run for our Image Collecting trip on March 8, 2013 with students from Isaac Dickson Elementary School.

Results: we obtained some great images, inexpensively and we had a lot of fun doing it!  We stitched about 20 that we liked in Microsoft ICE and about 20 seconds later we had a pretty good layout.  We will continue to process the images, and hope to get some more great ones with our Community Outing next week!

We learned a lot on our test run; mainly about our cameras and the importance of electrical tape.  We learned that 4 people is not too many when working with a weather balloon and to keep an eye out for trees!
