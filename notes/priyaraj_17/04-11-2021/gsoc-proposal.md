## Project Description:

  
Abstract / Summary (<20 words):

The project focuses on the enhancement of the existing content management system. This will involve fixing or improving a collection of systems, features, and issues.  
  

# Problem:

What problem(s) does your project solve?

Currently, the existing content management system encounters few problems due to the growing community of educators. The objective is to tackle a collection of systems, features and issues focused on educational users and involving feedback from the community of the educators. The new features to be added include improvement of autocompletion results, a listing of drafts on profile pages, detailed tooltips on maps, a system for pre-approved posting for students that can bypass the moderation system, and a refined display of coauthored posts on profile pages. These features will make the experience of the users more effective and easy.  
\*\*

# Project Goals and their implementations:

1. Include Usernames in Autocompletion results:
2. The autocompletion results will show the usernames used recently or who were active recently on the website with full wildcard matching.
3. This will be easily done with some SQL and API changes.
4. Something similar to this.
