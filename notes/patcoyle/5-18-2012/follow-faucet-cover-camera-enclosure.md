Sal Cangeloso <sal@geek.com> posted a neat article on his experience with his Kickstarter balloon mapping kit and suggested redesigned camera holder to address slipping camera problem.

He wrote, "Hey Jeff, Seems like you're the go-to guy for publiclaboratory (thought I had bought the kit from kickstarter/mathew lippincott), anyway, just wanted to send the above link your way. I enjoyed working with the balloon kit and plan on using it again soon. I went with a different option for holding the camera, though I'm going to keep experimenting on that front."

When I expressed interest, he wrote, "I'll try to track down some more pics of the camera holder. It's essentially just a piece of plastic with a foam insert designed to stop outdoor faucets from freezing in the winter. I got luck b/c the size made for a perfect press-fit with my clunky old camera. Then I used rubber bands to hold on the stabilizers and to act as a secondary security measure in case the press fit failed.

The faucet cover is by Nation Wide Products. They are available at Lowes and Home Depot:

Exact model is here (on top), the durable model has the plastic shell:

The Lowes here in Livermore, CA had them, so I picked up three of each and checked out the A490, A495 and iPhone fit in them.  I also visually compared them to the 3-camera rig prototype I've been using. See photos at:

Appealing found approach. While I have not tried it, the attachment to balloon or kite line doesn't appear as straightforward as with the soda or juice bottles I've used. Reinforced strapping or Tyvek tape loops might work. The hard-shell unit is a right cylindrical shape, so the camera is flush with the top of of the cavity. The size accommodates the A490/495s, but not an iPhone. Need to address camera attachment and openings and penetrations out the top of the enclosure so the camera doesn't rock or wobble against a knot of rubber bands, etc. The soft shell unit is tapered and provides a solid, non-rocking attachment base for a camera drawn up snug into the enclosure, e. g., with rubber bands. However, it doesn't have the rigid shell and attaching a tensioned rubber band to the outside of the base may need a clip to avoid tearing out the foam body. 

It offers a nice inexpensive variant to have in the tool kit.
