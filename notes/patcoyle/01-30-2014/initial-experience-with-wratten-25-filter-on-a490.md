# Initial experience with Wratten 25 filter on A490

###What I want to do
Change external filter on A490 from Rosco 2007 to Wratten 25. Try it for NDVI. 

###My attempt and results

First testing image examples, were shot after custom white balance in shade using red file folder:

Additional test images show comparable NDVI images in my front yard, shot with Rosco 2007, with improved white balance, and the new Wratten 25 filter; processed with Ned Horning tool with the Chris Fasti lut.
