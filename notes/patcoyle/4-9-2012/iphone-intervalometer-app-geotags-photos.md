I just wrote to the http://www.screensmudge.com blog, "Very pleased to find your CameraSharp app ($1.99) supports geotagging. I just tried it and confirmed the EXIF and gps info is written to the photos in continuous mode. I had tried a couple other intervalometers, but found they didn't do this. Your app offers an attractive capability for people doing simple aerial photography with kites and balloons. They can fly an iPhone with your app in continuous mode and get a set of georeferenced images to make into maps. Nice.
