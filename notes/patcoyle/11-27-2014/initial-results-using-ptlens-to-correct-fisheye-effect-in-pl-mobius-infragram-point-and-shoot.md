###What I want to do
Correct fisheye effect in images from PL Mobius Infragram Point and Shoot. One tool is [PTLens ($25)](http://epaperpress.com/ptlens/purchase.html). 
###My attempt and results
Based on conversation with Stewart Long and his experience with GoPros, I used my neighbor's garage door to provide an image with a grid feature. I then used the 10-free-image trial version of PTLens to apply fisheye correction and crop the images. Used Adobe PS to make a panorama from the infrablue images. Used Ned Horning's Fiji Photomonitoring plugin to process the infrablue panorama to NDVI.

###Questions and next steps

Explore settings and use of the PTLens software. Explore other software solutions to address the fisheye effect. Consider replacement lens options for the Mobius.

###Why I'm interested
The fisheye distorted images are difficult to stitch into maps.
