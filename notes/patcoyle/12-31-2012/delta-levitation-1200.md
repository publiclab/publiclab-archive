During break in rainy weather on Boxing Day, flew Delta Levitation around the neighborhood with A-1200 in juice bottle rig, shooting in continuous mode. Camera shifted in housing so images oblique enough that have quite a bit of distortion in the result. The uncropped images of the Delta in flight and in the image gallery show the impingement of the bottle edge due to the shifted camera. Looks like adding physical stops or bumpers inside the housing and trimming the bottle back would help.
