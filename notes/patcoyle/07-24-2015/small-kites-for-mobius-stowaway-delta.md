###What I want to do
Continue to explore smaller kites for use with Mobius Infragram plant cam. See prior [note](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/07-20-2015/small-parafoil-kite-for-mobius-camera) and [note](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/07-17-2015/more-re-small-pocket-sled-kite-for-mobius-camera) and [note](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/07-14-2015/smal-pocket-sled-kite-for-mobius-camera).

My prior notes document experience with the the pocket sled which was marginal and the Premier Parafoil 5 which was very useable in a small form-factor package. 

This one presents the initial result with the Prism Stowaway Delta, a very capable 5' delta that breaks down to 18" package. Based on the pull, this kite looks like it will also lift our typical single camera Canon point and shoot in a juice bottle rig.

###My attempt and results
The Prism Stowaway Delta flies better with tails. I used the ribbon tail that came with it and 15' fuzzy tails from [Brooxes KAP](http://www.brooxes.com/), as shown below:

This video is a little dizzy-making but shows the image sequence from the flight at 24 fps. It is an interesting take on what the platform captures:

Main image shows exported image from Mapknitter and the color and grey-scale NDVI images from Ned Horning's Fiji photomonitoring plug-in.

###Questions and next steps

As before, tried Gimp lens correction and stitched a few images in MapKnitter. The alternate lens option looks more attractive, if a suitable non-fish-eye one works out.

###Why I'm interested
As noted in prior posts, portable, even if not "pocket-sized" aerial photo mapping tools have a place in our tool kits.
