Flew a short test flight in Livermore CA with repaired Delta spar pocket, dual A1200s in bottle-bottom rig, Digispark triggered CHDK. 

<a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/patcoyle/2-21-2013/initial-experience-sx260hs-gps">I first reported on this spar pocket QC issue in update to note on initial experience with SX260HS.</a>

This was just a test, nothing was optimized: the picavet rig was not balanced with weights to improve orientation, the IR camera was low on batteries and stopped early into the flight, there was no gps tracker on flight. Several of the >300 images (nominal 5 sec interval) were oblique enough that there were issues in the resulting map.
