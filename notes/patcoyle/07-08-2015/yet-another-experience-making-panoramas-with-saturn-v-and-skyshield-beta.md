###What I want to do

Continue to explore making panoramas with the Chris Fastie and Don Blair Arduino controlled Saturn V and SkyShield beta with pan and tilt and CHDK for aerial panoramas. I've reported my [subsequent](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/06-20-2015/additional-experience-with-with-saturn-v-and-skyshield-beta) and [initial experience ](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/06-04-2015/initial-experience-with-saturn-v-and-skyshield-beta)and tried some of this myself with a [different pan-only rig.](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/05-22-2014/initial-results-kap-with-arduino-driven-servo-with-chdk-for-panoramas)

###My attempt and results
Flew Delta 9' Levitation with Canon A1200 in autoexposure mode, rather than A495 used for prior attempts. Camera tray hole configuration led me to use 1/2" long 1/4 by 20 wingnut to get adequate purchase on camera tripod threads. I also added a safety loop to secure the camera to the rig.Otherwise configuration as before.

Images from PS's Photomerge still look saddle-like:

###Questions and next steps

Fly and continue to evaluate. Consider sketch edits like Chris has made. Try other cameras.

###Why I'm interested

As indicated before, integration of simple computing capability into our projects can provide flexibility and versatility and I'd like to learn more about using these small boards. People have expressed interest in making aerial panoramas. Again, Chris and Don fielded this in a few weeks. Kudos to them, yet again!
