###What I want to do
Continue to explore the [Chris Fastie ](http://publiclab.org/profile/cfastie)and [Don Blair](http://publiclab.org/profile/donblair) Arduino controlled Saturn V and SkyShield beta with pan and tilt and CHDK for aerial panoramas. I've[ reported my initial experience ](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/06-04-2015/initial-experience-with-saturn-v-and-skyshield-beta)and tried some of this myself [with a different pan-only rig](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/05-22-2014/initial-results-kap-with-arduino-driven-servo-with-chdk-for-panoramas).
###My attempt and results

Flew Delta 9' Levitation with Canon A495 (just in autoexposure mode). Again used Brooks hangups rather than the kite line clips. Addressed prior reported issue with the camera cable coming loose, by using the ubiquitous Alliance latex free orange bands to snug the cable to the SkyShield pins. I just let the SkyShield dangle rather than attach it to the rig with the velcro pads.

Managed to launch by myself, but had help on rig detachment after flight.

Main image above is a Photoshop automated Photomerge of several images, as are these below. In response to Chris Fastie comment below, I used the default selection as indicated in screenshot below.

###Questions and next steps

Fly and continue to evaluate.

###Why I'm interested

As indicated before, integration of simple computing capability into our projects can provide flexibility and versatility and I'd like to learn more about using these small boards. People have expressed interest in making aerial panoramas. Again, Chris and Don fielded this in a few weeks. Kudos to them!
