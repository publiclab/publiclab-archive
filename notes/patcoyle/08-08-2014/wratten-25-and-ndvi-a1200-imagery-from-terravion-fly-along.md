###What I want to do
Share initial results of Wratten 25 and resulting NDVI A1200 imagery from [TerrAvion](http://www.terravion.com/) fly-along.

###My attempt and results
[Stewart Long](http://publiclab.org/profile/gonzoearth) and I met with [team at TerrAvion](http://www.terravion.com/). A startup that provides weekly aerial imagery for agriculture, including NDVI, color infrared, and thermal imagery with next day processing/delivery on a subscription basis. 

Robert Morris and Cornell Wright, principals, were very familiar with PublicLab and were willing to discuss their approach and workflow and try to fly our cameras on one of their runs.

They added our Canon SX260HS (visible) and A1200 (Wratten 25), both running CHDK intervalometer script. (To Chris Fastie's comment, below, they were just running in auto mode, unless by chance, I'd managed to set the 1/800 speed Chris noted. The visible images were overexposed and blurry, suggesting too slow a shutter speed.) 

Maps: I selected this area from the images along the flight path, because of readily discernible features and a good variety of crops and fallow land. The area spans about eight miles, longest map I've done in Mapknitter. There are over 700 images, so I may look for additional areas of interest to map.

I find you need to zoom out like six click to get the image in the map viewer.

###Questions and next steps
I want to explore opportunities to collaborate with Terravion for pro-bono imagery for publications.

###Why I'm interested
I'm delighted with their service and receptiveness to Public Lab
