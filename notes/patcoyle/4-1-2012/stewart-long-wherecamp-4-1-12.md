We had the Kickstarter kit there, tank of helium, the <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/patcoyle/3-31-2012/3-camera-housing-photos-and-test-kap-session">3-camera rig</a>, kite and other and other gear. However, it was windy enough that not good day for balloons and the urban setting wasn't conducive for kites.

One person spoke of upcoming event to collaborate with PLOTS in New York to take air quality and biological samples. Another had purchased the kit and was interested in mapping at Dolores Park in San Francisco.
