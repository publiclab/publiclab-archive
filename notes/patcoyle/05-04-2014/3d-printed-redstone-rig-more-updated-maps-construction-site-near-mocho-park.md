###What I want to do

Commission [3D printed Redstone rig with Picavet](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-15-2014/pierre-s-plastic-picavet).

Continue to update maps with construction site activities across the street from Mocho Park, Livermore CA. As previously noted, recording construction or other activities over time is one use of these tools. Initial mapping of this site was conducted in September 2013 and described in [note](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/02-27-2014/more-updated-maps-construction-site-activities-near-mocho-park) and [note](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/01-17-2014/updated-maps-construction-site-activities-near-mocho-park) and [note](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/09-17-2013/kap-with-simple-dual-juice-bottle-rig-infragram-and-visible-mapping-around-mocho-park-livermore-ca).

The main image and map below show the construction progress as of May 2014. 

The following image shows the construction progress as of late-February 2014. Roof sheathing is in progress.

The following image shows the construction progress as of mid-January 2014.

The following image of the site shows initial site preparation and excavation for footings.

I also ran 70 of the images through AutoDesk's 123DCatch web tool with this result:

The following playlist includes videos of my experience building the Redstone rig as well as the maiden flight. A matter of some concern is the snippet of video showing a plane towing an advertising banner too low for my comfort. I'm still checking, but INFORMATION FOR BANNER TOW OPERATIONS, FAA/FS-I-8700-1, RULES TO FOLLOW FOR FLIGHT OPERATIONS, states: Due to the area around which such operations are usually conducted (congested areas/open-air assembly of persons), the pilot will exercise special precautions to ensure compliance with section 91.119(a)(b)(c). Operations around congested areas/open-air assemblies must be no lower than 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle. Looking further, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91 GENERAL OPERATING AND FLIGHT RULES, Subpart B--Flight Rules, General, Sec. 91.119; Minimum safe altitudes: General. States: Except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate an aircraft below the following altitudes:
(a) Anywhere. An altitude allowing, if a power unit fails, an emergency landing without undue hazard to persons or property on the surface.
(b) Over congested areas. Over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or over any open air assembly of persons, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft.
(c) Over other than congested areas. An altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure. I was below that.

###My attempt and results

Flew quick KAP session to make my first flight with [3D printed Redstone rig with Picavet (many thanks to Chris Fastie)](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-15-2014/pierre-s-plastic-picavet) and capture updated construction site activities and adjacent areas. Flew Delta 9' Levitation with A1200, running CHDK intervalometer script.

###Questions and next steps

I want to continue to explore use of the Picavet vs juice bottle rigs and update maps of this site as construction progress continues.



###Why I'm interested

The ability to 3D print rigs and accessories is powerful capability. Our ability to document changes in our built environment is a key benefit of the Public Lab tools.
