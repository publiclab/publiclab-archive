###What I want to do

Continue to explore smaller kites for use with Mobius Infragram plant cam. See prior [note](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/07-17-2015/more-re-small-pocket-sled-kite-for-mobius-camera) and [note](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/07-14-2015/smal-pocket-sled-kite-for-mobius-camera).

I had been cautioned that the pocket sled was not enough of a lifter and my preliminary results showed it was marginal. My next step up was the [Premier Parafoil 5 kite](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LZBEK4?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00). As shown by the main image, this is still a small package. The pouch has the kite, ribbon tail, 500 foot winder, bottle-top rig, and Mobius camera.

###My attempt and results

I was delighted with flight performance of this kit as shown in this video. It does have the low angle of attack, long-reach characteristic of parafoils.

Photoshop photomerge of images and use of Ned Horning's tool follow:

###Questions and next steps

I also still haven't yet tried t[o correct the fish-eye distortion and make composite map. Prior results used Gimp.](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/03-17-2015/dji-uav-with-gimp-correction-of-fisheye-effect)

(updated: 7/20/15) Tried Gimp lens correction and stitched a few images in MapKnitter. I didn't aggressively crop the corrected images to just retain the "better" interior portion of the images. However, I did not see way to try to batch process the corrections. I looked at the Batch Image Manipulation Plugin (BIMP), but wasn't able to see how to get the actions. So, the alternate lens option looks more attractive, if a suitable non-fish-eye one works out.

I also tried the standard version of Photoscan. However, I don't have enough computing power to do more than a few images at low res. Image and NDVI from a pdf of the model follow:

I have another stock Mobius coming to try alternate lens modifications with less fish-eye distortion which may be useful as well.

Also, I read the reviews on the [Prism Stowaway Delta Kite ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044TGS1I?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) and ordered it. I like the high angle of attack characteristic of deltas. 

###Why I'm interested

As noted in prior posts, portable, "pocket" aerial photo mapping tools have a place in our tool kits.
