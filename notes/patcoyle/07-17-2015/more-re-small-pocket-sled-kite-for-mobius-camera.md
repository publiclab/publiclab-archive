###What I want to do
Continue to explore smaller kites for use with [Mobius Infragram plant cam](http://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram-point-shoot). [See prior note.

###My attempt and results
I tried twice today. 
First time the winds were too light. See video below.

Later in the afternoon, flight was marginal in terms of lift, but yielded images from the [small bottle rig.](https://flic.kr/s/aHskfFHrfz)
Modifications were made to the rig after the initial photos. Moved the foam outside the rubber bands. Bands were directly in contact with the camera for more secure connection, which also resulted in better access to camera control buttons.

Video illustrates the low lift issue:

###Questions and next steps

I may move up to the next larger kite, the Parafoil 5, from Into The Wind.


[![IMG_6038_bigger_ITW_kite_crpd.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/706/medium/IMG_6038_bigger_ITW_kite_crpd.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/706/original/IMG_6038_bigger_ITW_kite_crpd.jpg)

Others may have more informed perspectives on other simple soft kites for use with the [Mobius Infragram plant cam](http://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram-point-shoot). 

I'm shooting for very portable, no-spar, alternative to a UAV launched camera.

I also haven't yet tried t[o correct the fish-eye distortion and make composite map. Prior results used Gimp.](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/03-17-2015/dji-uav-with-gimp-correction-of-fisheye-effect)

Alternate lens modifications with less fish-eye distortion may be useful as well.

Photoshop photomerge of selected images illustrate the fish-eye issue:

###Why I'm interested

Portable, "pocket" aerial photo mapping tools have a place in our tool kits.
