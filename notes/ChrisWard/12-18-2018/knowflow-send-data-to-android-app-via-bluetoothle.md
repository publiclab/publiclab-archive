DFRobot manufacture the Bluno - An Arduino Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) Board. Their first example project led me to Public Lab:

It would be great to be able to send the data to an Android App via BLE. It's easy to create the App exactly as required with MIT's App Inventor http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu

  
However, I cannot find an Arduino Sketch for KnowFlow and Bluno that uses Bluno's onboard BLE to share data collected. Has anybody achieved this?
