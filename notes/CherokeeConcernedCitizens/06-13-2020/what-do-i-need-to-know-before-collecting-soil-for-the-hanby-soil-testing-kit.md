We are testing the soil for petroleum hydrocarbons in our neighborhood using the Hanby soil testing kit. The instructions are easy to follow but there is not any information about how to collect the soil sampling. We would like to know what we should consider when choosing the location for collecting the soil, how far down should we dig to collect the sample, and anything else we may not be thinking to ask. Thanks
