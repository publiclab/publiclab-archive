I want to build a citizen science network in Los Angeles, integrating both the research and education communities

Here's a [list](http://scienceland.wikispaces.com) of some of the work I've done so far.

I'd like to establish at least one citizen science lab for students to use in Los Angeles.

Children are our future, at least until we can build better robots.
