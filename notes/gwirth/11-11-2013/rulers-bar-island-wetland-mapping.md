Eymund and I from NY Public Lab took a quick visit out to Jamaica Bay this weekend, to check out the progress of the Littoral Society/ Jamaica Bay Ecowatchers spartina planting on Rulers Bar Island. 

Many of the plugs had grown considerably. The tide came in fast as we were out there, but we managed to get some nice birdseye shots during our quick trip. See more photos at :
