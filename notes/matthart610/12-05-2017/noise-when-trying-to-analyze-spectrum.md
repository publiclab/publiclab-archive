# Noise when Trying to Analyze Spectrum

This is my first time trying to use this and the images I had taken from my phone of the diffraction pattern show only noise levels when looking at the intensity vs. wavelength? Any suggestions? Is the slit too big, do I need a better camera, is there possible excess light bleeding in?

Here are the images of the calibration and a tungsten bulb:

Thanks you for the help!
