It's time for an update on the Q & A Project. The Q & A Project is almost up and running and now you can Post and answer a question from the Q & A pages. Here are all the detailed list of  features that are introduced in the Q & A pages. You can now visit the  https://publiclab.org/questions link to view all the questions in publiclab.org website.

## Listing all recent, popular and liked questions

As you can see in the main image as well as you visit the link all the questions are listed chronologically according to the date when they were posted. The **Popular** tab shows all questions arranged by the number of views. The **Liked** tab shows all questions according to the number of likes to each question.

## Search questions and Ask questions

A search box has been included in the questions page where you can search similar questions that you want to ask. It is always good to see whether similar questions has been asked earlier. If there are no similar questions the search redirects to the post question link.

## View questions and Like them

You can click on the link of a question to view the question. The questions view is kept same except some minor changes like **Ask a question** button and the number of answers is shown in the view. You can like a question from the Like button in the top right side of the page(provided you are logged in) which also shows the number of likes. All functionalities of a research note applies to a question.

This is how an answer looks in the question page. You can post an answer to a question in the answer editor given at the bottom of all answers. The answer editor is similar to the comment editor in notes page except that it also contains the formatting toolbar present in the post page.

You can like an answer and copy the link of the answer from the share icon. If you are the author of the question you can mention the answer as accepted if you think it solved your query, by clicking the **accept answer** button (log in required). Once you accept the answer a green  **accepted** label will be shown that will be visible beside the question.

## New comments interface for Q & A pages

Introducing the new comments interface for questions and answers. Now you can post comments for both questions and answers. Comments for questions and answers are aimed for better clarification related to the question or answer. Comments for question appear just below the question and comments for answer appear just below the answer. You can toggle the comments for the answers by clicking the **Comments** button below the answer.

Deleting and editing permissions of comments follow the same rule as earlier. More comments are listed by clicking the **View more** button which also shows the number of comments yet to show. Expandable comment boxes are included that increase in size as you type in.

## Get email notifications for Q & As

Users will get custom email notifications for posting questions. email notifications will also be sent for each new answers posted to the question author and users who liked the question and to those who also posted an answer to the question. email notifications for question comments remain the same as before. For answer comments notification is sent to the answer author, those mentioned in the comment, those who liked the answer and others involved in the conversation.

# Upcoming modifications and fixes
There are few bug fixes that need to be made like the question link in the search box dropdown that currently doesn't work properly which will be solved soon. Also  some new views will be introduced like a **Recently answered** view for questions landing page, a new section for **Asked questions** in user profile and some distinct sidebar for Q & A pages.

Currently there are two formats for posting a question in the website. Soon the links for Q & A pages will be available in the dashboard and the navbar and all the relevant links for questions will be replaced with the new question links that will make the Q & A system available to all users.

# Feedback and Suggestions

Any Feedback and Suggestion is welcome and will greatly help in making the Q & A pages better.
