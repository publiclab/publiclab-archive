Hi, 
I dont know much about science of spectrometry, but I am working on a project where i need to detect and differentiate between different types of material types, and I was just wondering if I can use an Spectrometer such as Desktop Spectrometry Kit v3 to distinguish and detect different material types. For example to distinguish glass object from metal, plastic and paper object.

thanks
