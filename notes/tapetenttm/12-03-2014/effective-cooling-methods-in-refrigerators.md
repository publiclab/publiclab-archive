###Studyrefrigerators

Hypothesis: Refrigerators in older buildings will have less efficient cooling systems, making them have a larger range of temperature throughout, as well as being warmer overall. 

1.To test our hypothesis, we took thermal images of three different refrigerators. 
2. The fridge was kept shut until the moment the camera began to film.
3. The fridge was kept closed 15 minutes prior to filming. 
4. All fridges were set to their “standard” temperature
(Level 5 was considered the standard)
