Hey guys! I am trying to measure color reflectance (or absorption) using the desktop spectrometer. While this seems simple, I need to find the reflectance values for color paper, which light can't exactly pass through. Any suggestions on how to set this up? Also, any help with reading the spectralworkbench outputs would be appreciated as well! My focus is with ecology and animal behavior, so this type of instrumentation is not my strong point. 
Thanks!
