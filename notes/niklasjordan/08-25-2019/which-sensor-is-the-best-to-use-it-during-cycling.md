Hello folks,  
I am planning a small project and would like to measure what fine dust pollution I am exposed to when cycling. I am looking for a suitable sensor.  
  
For various reasons, I would like to build on an Arduino. So far I have always worked with the SDS011 sensor. However, it is out of the question for this project because it has a response time of about 10 seconds. This is much too long for a moving sensor on a bicycle.  
  
Do you have any idea about which sensor I could use?
