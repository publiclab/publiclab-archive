# [WIP] Step by Step: Build a fine dust sensor with Arduino (Beginners Guide)

## Introduction

In this manual I will explain step by step how to build your own fine dust sensor. Don't worry, it sounds more complicated than it is.

**For whom is this manual suitable?**
In principle for everyone. You don't have to be able to program and you don't ever need to have tinkered with Arduinos. However, it is advantageous if you have some basic technical knowledge and can handle your computer ;-)

**What can you do with the sensor?**
The sensor measures particulate matter, the most damaging air pollutant. Particulate matter are divided into groups according to size, yet all are invisible to the human eye. Larger particles (PM10) consists of substances such as dust, asbestos and lead, and can get into the lungs, while smaller ones (PM2.5) include organic compounds and metals, and can penetrate deeper into the respiratory system.

## Step-by-step Guide

### 1\. What do you need?

You don't need that much. If you are a well-equipped DIY enthusiast, you only need the hardware parts for the sensor. Otherwise you will need the following tools to match the hardware parts:

 - Soldering iron (It's enough to buy a very cheap one)
 - Soldering tin (Here it doesn't really matter which one you use. I can highly recommend [Fairloetet][1]'s tin, as it is produced fairly.)
 - Computer (PC, Mac or Linux)
 - Helping Hands Magnifier Station (You don't necessarily need it, but it makes things a lot easier for you.)

You may already have all this stuff at home. Now you need the materials for the sensor:

 - Air quality sensor: [Nova PM SDS011][2]
 - Microcontroller: [Wemos D1 mini][3] (with headers)
 - 4 [M/F jumper wires][4]
 - Micro-USB cable and USB charger

### 2\. Build the hardware

*Note: If you have never had a soldering iron in your hand, the first thing you should do is follow these instructions: [Introduction to soldering][5]*

### 3\. Make the software
