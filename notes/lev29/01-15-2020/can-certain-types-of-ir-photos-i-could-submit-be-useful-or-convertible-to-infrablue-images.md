I own both digital SLR and mirrorless Sony cameras that capture only visible light images. I also own Full Spectrum-converted Sony mirrorless camera to which I apply a number of different external optical filters, including the following (note that for simple bandpass filters, I use the letter "K" followed by the approximate cutoff wavelength as expressed in nanometers):

K470, K 550, K590, K610, K665, K720, K830, K950 and besides a Hot Mirror filter, two with proprietary names, Superblue & IR Chrome.

To date, all such images acquired have been by pure "capture," i.e. no post-processing. I plan to employ Luminar for post-processing and channel-swapping.

I also own a small combination Thermal Imaging & Visible Light camera that simultaneously captures both types of images.
