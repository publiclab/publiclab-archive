FOOLING OR REDUCING THE QUANTITY OF H2S (hydrogen sulfide) IN WELL TESTS.


The following are known ways to reduce the quantity of H2S measured in flow streams of gas wells:
Sample source point:
Obtain the gas sample from a pipe wherein the gas is at a pressure above the vapor pressure of H2S.  The H2S will be largely in liquid form concentrated near the lower section of the pipe.
Obtain the gas sample downstream of scavenger which is being injected into the flow-stream at the well site.
Obtain the sample from a horizontally disposed pipe at a point on top of the pipe.
Obtain the sample in a “mild steel” or “stainless steel” container.  The H2S will react with the steel/ss and be reduced in quantity over a relatively short period of time.
Place iron powder in the container prior to taking the sample.
Place water in the container prior to taking the sample.
Place scavenger material in the container prior to taking the sample.
