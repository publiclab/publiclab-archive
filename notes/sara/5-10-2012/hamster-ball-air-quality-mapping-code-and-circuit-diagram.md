Byeongwon has been working on a Hamster ball version of the Indoor Air Mapping Hamster Ball. Here is a circuit diagram. The Circuit uses an Arduino Nano so that it can fit more easily inside the ball. In addition to the older circuit there is a Servo Motor that drives the hamster ball around the floor.
