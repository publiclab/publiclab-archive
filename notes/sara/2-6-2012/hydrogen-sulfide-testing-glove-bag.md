We are presently looking for sites close to providence or boston to test our hydrogen sulfide strips in a lab environment. As glove boxes are hard to come by one possibility is using a glove bag (suggested by EPA researcher affiliated with RISD EPSCOR prgram):

Inside a glove bag or box we would expose our strips to a known quantity of H2S in order to calibrate and quantify our test strips.
