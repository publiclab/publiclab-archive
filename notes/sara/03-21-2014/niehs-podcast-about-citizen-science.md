# NIEHS podcast about Citizen Science

###NIEHS podcast about Citizen Science

Following my recent [talk](http://publiclab.org/notes/Sara/01-02-2014/talk-at-national-institute-of-environmental-health-science-niehs) at NIEHS (National Institute for Environmental Health Science) I was delighted to be asked to give a podcast about Citizen Science efforts. Here are the results:
[http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/supported/dert/programs/peph/podcasts/citizen_science/index.cfm](http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/supported/dert/programs/peph/podcasts/citizen_science/index.cfm)

It's great to see support and interest in Citizen Science coming from NIEHS. As a research agency they have made huge strides in our understanding of environmental health threats like endocrine disruptors and in supporting environmental justice and community engaged research. Their [strategic plan goals](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/about/strategicplan/strategicplan2012_508.pdf) are really worth an examination, as there are many possibilities for imagining how they might involve Civic Science projects. Oh I use the term Citizen Science in this podcast because it's all of 6 minutes and that just isn't long enough for a discussion about whether Citizen or Civic Science is a more appropriate term. I thought it best to take the time to describe a few projects and the potential they promise for rethinking science and how agencies might interact with public in much more tangible ways.
