<strong>SAFETY AND H2S
</strong>
Excellent <a href="http://octane.nmt.edu/sw-pttc/proceedings/H2S_05/H2S%20Employee%20Safety.pdf">pdf</a> on toxicity and safety measure for H2S from <a href="http://www.novasafetyandenvironmental.com/NOVA.html">NOVA safety and environmental</a>: 

Highlights:

General Properties: Invisible, Flammable, Explosive, Toxic Odor of Rotten Eggs Corrosive, Water and Oil Soluble, Heavier than Air

When H2S mixes with water it forms a weak acid. Thereâ€™s water in our eyes, nose, throat and respiratory system which leads to irritation. Examples: burning eyes, sore/scratchy throat, coughing, respiratory irritation.

P.E.L. = Permissible Exposure Limit Defined as the maximum air concentration you can be exposed to in an 8 hour period, 40 Hour Week, without respiratory protection. Established by O.S.H.A., making it a LAW.

P.E.L. for H2S is 10 ppm

I.D.L.H. = Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health. I.D.L.H. 
H2S = 100 ppm 

S.T.E.L. = Short Term Exposure Limit, based on a 15 Minute Time Period 
S.T.E.L. H2S = 15 ppm

Symptoms of Exposure:
Burning Eyes, Sore Throat, Respiratory Irritation. Coughing, Headache, Dizziness Nausea, Fatigue, Confusion, Loss of Sense of Smell

H2S is a highly flammable and explosive gas. 
H2S fires produce a toxic gas. Ignition Temp is 500 F

The main byproduct of an H2S fire is Sulfur Dioxide or SO2. 
P.E.L. SO2 = 2 ppm 
I.D.L.H. SO2 = 20 ppm

What to do in event of Alarm:

Stay Wind Smart Always pay attention to the flags or wind socks. When alarms sound, retreat cross wind to the safe briefing area. Well Head Wind Direction
