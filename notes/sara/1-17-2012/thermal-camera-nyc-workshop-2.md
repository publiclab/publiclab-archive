Yesterday January 17th members of public lab gathered in NYC to learn a bit about creative electronics with Lief Percifield and Joe Saavedra. We learned the basics of electricity and working with arduino. We also successfully built prototypes of the thermal camera.  We are are working on an illustrated step by step guide for others to use to get started. Till that comes online here are some of thermal pictures we made
