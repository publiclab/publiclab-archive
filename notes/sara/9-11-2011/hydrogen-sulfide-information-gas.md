1.1.2 Toxic effects (This section is for information only and should not be taken as the basis of OSHA policy.)

Symptoms observed from exposure between 5 and 2000 ppm are as follows: 
1000 – 2000 ppm:  Breathing stops due to paralysis of the respiratory system. 
500 – 1000 ppm:  Breathing rates speed up followed  by temporary suspension of 
breathing at higher concentrations.   
50 – 500 ppm:  Respiratory tract and eye irritation. Prolonged exposures to concentrations between 50 and 600 ppm can cause pulmonary edema (swelling and accumulation of fluid in the lungs).  Olfactory fatigue occurs at concentrations between 150 and 200 ppm. 
5 - 50 ppm:  Irritation of the eyes.    
    
Long term effects from repeated hydrogen sulfide exposure have not been established but symptoms may include dizziness, headaches and fatigue.  Hydrogen sulfide is not regarded as a cumulative toxin as it is quickly oxidized to sulfate and then excreted by the kidneys.
