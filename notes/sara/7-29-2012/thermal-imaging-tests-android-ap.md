During the Community Environmental College workshops with Environmental Justice League we experimented with a free long exposure photo android phone application: <a href="http://www.androidzoom.com/android_applications/photography/camera-streak_vkrx.html">camera streak</a>. Here are a couple of resulting images. None of them are that great because the resolution for the images through the application are so low. But I think the various android and iphone application should definitely be further investigated because its much easier than carrying around a computer!

Also included is a photo of the four working Thermal Flashlights made by the community environmental college students. The students had no previous experience with electronics. They are each set to different temperatures and we tried out making different images of the same area with each flashlight.
