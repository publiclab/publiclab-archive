On the 4th of February, Public Lab and RISD's Digital+Media Department hosted a Thermal Flashlight Workshop.  The workshop went great! All of the students managed to make a Thermal Flashlight in 3 hours, many of them had little to no electronics experience. This is particularly exciting as during the workshop we realized we had ordered 5 Volt Melexis sensors rather than 3 Volt sensor we had developed the circuit board.  Thankfully, Jeff, Shannon and I were able to figure out a fix on the run.  Attached is a circuit diagram for the Thermal Flashlight if you use a 5 Volt sensor rather than a 3 Volt sensor.
