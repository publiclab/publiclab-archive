As promised, here are the details of the slit adjustment of my spectrometer.
The clips have notes on them which makes them self explanatory.
You can deduce that it is possible to change the angle of the slit by appropriate differential adjustments. You can also see that it is possible to change the slit width by different differential adjustments.
The biggest difficulty was aligning everything within the black square plastic tube.

I still have to carry out detailed experiments with this setup, when I have re-assemble it.
