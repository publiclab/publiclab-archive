###What I want to do
I want to sell WheeStats to all the chemistry departments in the southeast.
###My attempt and results
I will be presenting a poster to the hard-core chemistry nerds who live within driving distance of Nashville.  This will be the same poster that I present at Maker Faire two weeks earlier.  I think my session will be Saturday, October 18, but I can't tell yet. 
###Why I'm interested
