###What I want to do
In my last Potentiostat note (found [here](http://publiclab.org/notes/JSummers/12-30-2013/potentiostat-notes-3-wheestat-5-1-fabrication)), I droned on for three paragraphs about how to fabricate a printed circuit board.  Here is the easy way.
###My attempt and results
[This](http://oshpark.com/profiles/SmokyMtSci) link should take you directly to a page where you can order a board.  If it doesnt work, go to OSHPark.com, click on the "Shared Projects" link at the top of the page and look for "WheeStat5.1" (they are arranged chronologically, so look for things submitted on Jan 8, 2014).

Click on the link at the bottom of the page that says "Order".  You will need to order a minimum of three, at a total cost of $11.  Priority shipping is another $5 (in the US) but free shipping is available.  
Since this is my first foray into having boards fab'd, I had no idea what turn-around time to expect.  For those in a similar situation;  I ordered three boards Jan 8, they went to the fab house on the 10th and they shipped on the 16th.  I expect they will get to my office on Monday the 20th.  Thus, from first click to delivery took a little less than two weeks.  Be aware that you will still need to purchase and solder on the components (they are just shipping you the board).

###Questions and next steps
Question--Why have I been doing this the hard way?
Next steps-- I have three boards on order (also on order is a stencil from OSHstencils.com).  Once these come in and I have convinced myself that this really is the way to go, I will order a larger run and make a set of instruments for use in lab this semester.  If you would like a board, let me know.  I can have extras made when I place my next order (For a larger order the price drops).
