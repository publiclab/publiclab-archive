I am having a bit of trouble getting my end result photo as "colour sensitive" as I would like,

I have seen a few photos uploaded onto here that are very good and you can clearly see separation between Higher Photosynthesis and lower,

example this image..

my images are ending up a bit different and not as colour sensitive like this..

Im not sure if its because my image isnt a high enough quality when I export it or Stitch all the photos together.
I am wondering if anyone has any advice for me to maybe make my images a bit more sensitive like the first photo I posted?

thanks
