Using a Quadcopter and some software to control the Copter Autonomously, I can take infrared photos using my converted Canon A495 from directly above the area I choose.

the best thing about the copter is I can set the altitude I would like it to fly at and set the mission course and then go.

also the Camera hangs perfectly underneath the copter and takes photos directly downwards

The only thing holding me back now is waiting on the filter packs to be sent to me! :(

if anyone would like any maps done of the south of Australia, either it be visible or infrared let me know!
