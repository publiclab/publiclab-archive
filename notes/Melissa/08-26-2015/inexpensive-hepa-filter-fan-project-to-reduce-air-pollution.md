**What I want to do?**

At Tufts Medical Center Public Health Department, Dr. Doug Brugge and his fellow students developed an idea resembling of what folks in China are doing. In China the air pollution is incredibly high, and to combat this problem many people of lower socioeconomic status attached a filter and a fan together in hope of reducing the particulate matter in the air. 

His students, ran with this idea and created many different models of this filter fan using pretty cheap products from Walmart. 

**Why I'm interested?**

Air pollution has proven to be detrimental to one's health. Populations that are highly exposed to traffic, and therefore pollution, are commonly of lower socioeconomic status. To ensure their health is not endangered, a filtration system must be used in their homes. The cost can be hundreds of thousands of dollars. Hopefully this project can be of low cost to those affected and be efficient enough to reduce the particulate matter in the air. 

**The attempt and results:**

The fan was taped, caulked, and strung on to the filter but it did not ensure the best sealing between the two objects. The idea of some sort of frame was made. Dr. Brugge then decided to get in touch with a local engineer to create a better solution with this new concept of a frame. 

The below is a rough sketch (not by the engineer), we are not sure exactly how it will look like until the funds are met.

**Questions and next steps:**

Josh from the local Artisans' Asylum used the concept of the frame and had a great idea in mind. The frame will hold the filter and the frame will outline the outside of the fan in which a simple adhesive tape will attach them together. The frame will use plastic based materials with the use of a 3-D printer.
     
The project has not moved forward as there has been some funding issues on paying for the prototype and the multiple iterations. 
     
Once the building of the model is done, then there can be some control and pilot experiments done to ensure the efficiency of the product. 

**I need some input...**

Any suggestions on materials?

Is 3-D printing the way to go?

Anyone know of any available funding options  that would like to fund a small project?
