316L marine grade stainless steel welding rods seem to have all the right characteristics for conductivity sensor probes, including the fact that I have some sitting here in the corner.  The price is about $14 for a tube of 1/8" x 36" rods. I think there were originally 10 rods in the tube (not sure though).
