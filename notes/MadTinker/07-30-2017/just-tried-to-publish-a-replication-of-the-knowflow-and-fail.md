Tried to publish a replication of the KnowFlow monitoring system (as applied to my particular problem).  Got through an extensive write-up of the over all project goals and those related to replication.  

Was not permitted to Publish (button was not active), and then everything was wiped. Despite repeated saves, the material was deleted. Significant level of frustration.  Any tips before I attempt this again?
