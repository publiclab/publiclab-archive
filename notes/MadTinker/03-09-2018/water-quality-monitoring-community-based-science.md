I've been asked to give a presentation on my water quality work (philosophy, sensor development, STEM education, etc) at a small, local mining conference (San Juan Mining and Reclamation Conference, [http://www.mountainstudies.org/sjmrc/](http://www.mountainstudies.org/sjmrc/) ). They've been warned that all of the work is still in the development stage. Most of the topics and a majority of the hardware will be recognizable by Public Lab folks. The abstract is below and the presentation will be available on YouTube later this year.

**Abstract**

The
paper introduces some public science-based technology being developed to
support water quality monitoring of the Upper Rio Grande watershed. These
efforts involve the development of a network of simple _in situ_ water quality monitoring sensors, the development of
associated educational material to support science programs in the local
elementary school, and the development of a more sophisticated, portable sensor
package for both data collection and an educational resource. Often the collection of sophisticated, highly
accurate data is limited to a finite number of sampling locations over widely
spaced temporal sampling intervals. Even
with a large volunteer base, financial and other resources associated with
sample collection, preparation, and analysis can severely limit the
availability of data. An alternative is
the development of _in situ_ sensor
networks that provides quality data over a much broader time period. The goal
is to take advantage of the various efforts by various citizen science and open
source hardware groups to construct a network of lower cost sensor packages
that can be distributed through the Upper Rio Grande watershed. While somewhat
lower in measurement resolution, the sensor packages would provide the
capability to monitor changes to water quality over time and allow more focused
and timely response in the event of a mine breach, waste spill, etc. The subject of this presentation is work that
is still in the early stages of development but may still provide an
introduction to a path being explored and provide some points of welcome discussion
and feedback.
