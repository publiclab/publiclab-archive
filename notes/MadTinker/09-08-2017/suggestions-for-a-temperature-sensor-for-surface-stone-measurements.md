I have a large soapstone stove for heating our home this winter (about 3000lbs) and am interested in tracking the external temperature of the stove, possibly in more than one location simultaneously.  The external surface of the stove only gets to about 150F (66C) so it's not too extreme. This is mostly to try various data loggers, but I'd actually like to have some idea of how long the heat is retained in the evenings so I have some idea of when to reload the stove. Thanks!
