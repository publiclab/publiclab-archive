From what I can determine, there is a strong correlation between the information that comes from an ORP sensor and a PH sensor. I want to be as complete as possible with the data collection without duplicating data. 

Can I get by with one or the other, or would it be best to have both (like the [KnowFlow](https://publiclab.org/notes/shanlter/06-08-2017/knowflow-automatic-water-meter) ).   

Application: water quality in a stream that runs through mine tailings.  

Thanks in advance,
