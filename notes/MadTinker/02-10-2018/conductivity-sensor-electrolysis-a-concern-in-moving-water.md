I'm gone through quite a few of the references provided by [donblair](http://publiclab.org/profile/donblair) in [conductivity](https://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/01-07-2016/conductivity-sensing-open-questions) page Many thanks for these! One of the open questions was the issue with electrolysis that might occur between the sensor electrodes when over 1v is applied.

Q: would this really be an issue when the sensor is placed in moving water, e.g. a stream or river?
