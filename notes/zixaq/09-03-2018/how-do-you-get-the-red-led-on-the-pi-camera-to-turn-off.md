I've got my lego spec assembled and (finally) was able to boot it up and try it out. I don't have any experience with raspberry pi and limited experience in linux, so I'm kind of a newbie here. Google brings up a config edit that is supposed to disable the camera LED, but the fix isn't working for me (adding disable\_camera\_LED=1 to the boot config).

  
I get spectra, but there's also a substantial amount of red glare from the LED that I'd like to get rid of.

  
I'd normally just fuss with it myself in free time, but I'm hoping to get this together for a classroom experiments in a week or two.
