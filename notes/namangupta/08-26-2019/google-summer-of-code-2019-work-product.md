## GSoC 2019 Work Product - Naman Gupta

- **Student**: Naman Gupta
- **Github**: [Naman Gupta](https://github.com/namangupta01)
- **Organisation**: [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/)

## Aim

To implement WebSockets for various real-time communication in the project such as sending real-time browser notifications to Desktop and Mobile Devices for various users Action and to build a Graph Plotting Library.

### About Project

In this summer of code I was working on two projects. In major part of the summer i.e in last two phase I worked on WebSockets Implementation for real time interation using Action Cable. And in the first phase I worked on the setup of Graph Library from scratch. In the former project, I setup action cable for websocet connectivity in the project for real time communication which are currently being used to notify users via real time browser notification whenever a user comments or likes or being mentioned in the post. Most of the part in this projects goes to testing of action cable stream to action cable connection to various implementaion of action cable such as comments, like and mentioned. In the later project, I setup the data-grapher project from a single file structure to the standard node library file structure and divide the code into multiple files using oops design pattern. I have also added the feature of adding multiple graphs using multiple csv to the library. In the end, I also worked on some of bugs and issues outside my Google Summer of Code project i.e fixing issues related reply-by-mail and reply-by-tweet.
