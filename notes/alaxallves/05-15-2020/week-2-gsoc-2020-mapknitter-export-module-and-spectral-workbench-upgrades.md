This week I got to do some planning and also chatting with the folks at PublicLab. I have talked to Ruturaj Mohite and we have succesfully included the SimpleCov test coverage tool in the Rails upgrade at the Spectral Workbench repository:

- https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/pull/496 1

I have also participated in the community’s weekly bonding, where everyone in the community gets a chance to chat and report their accomplishments of the week:

- https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/7899#issuecomment-627024160 1

I’m also awaiting review on some PRs, such as:

- https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter-exporter-sinatra/pull/47 1
- https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/pull/499 1

My plans on the upcoming week is to create a detailed Planning Issue, as my mentor @warren has requested, for both Spectral and Mapknitter Exporter projects.
