###What I want to do: We are simply monitoring/watching for any egregious destruction ( outside of permit-allowed removal) of sand dunes at the Sargent Sand Co. Ludington, MI site.

###My attempt and results: We have positioned a trail-cam approx. 200 yards from a vertical mining lake that is being created by  dredging equipment

###Questions and next steps: After reviewing images taken so far (twice daily at 10:00 am and 4:00 pm), I am considering moving the trail-cam closer to obtain better images. My worry, however, is the discovery or the theft of the trail cam.

###Why I'm interested: We want to ensure that there will be a chronological record of the degree to which the dune landscape is being changed
