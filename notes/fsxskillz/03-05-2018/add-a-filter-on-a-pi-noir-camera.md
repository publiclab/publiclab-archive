Hi everyone,

  
I have a school project where i have to study the light spectrum on a specific wavelength (in the NIR part), so i decided to buy a Pi NoIR camera CS mount and buy a filter from Edmund/Thorlab and fix it on it.

  
I just couldn't know if i buy a filter would it be fixable on the Pi noIR camera objectif ? 

Is there any adapters that can be fixed on the camera Pi noIR objectif ? 

Is the CS mount have anything to do with the filters or is it just to fix lenses on the camera sensor ? 

  
Well thank you in advance !
