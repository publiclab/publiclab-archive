\*\*Project Title \*\*: UI Improvements to [PublicLab website](https://publiclab.org/research).

Mentors : Jeffrey Warren, Gaurav Sachdeva, Atibhi, Emmanuel Hayford, Sidharth, Mayank Pathela-1

\*\*Student \*\*: Gautami Gupta (gautamigupta54@gmail.com)

Project Repository : [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2)

###Project Details :

I was given the task to revamp the UI of the PublicLab website. I collaborated with Lekhika in this project. Our main aim was to improve the UI of the following pages : [People's page](https://publiclab.org/people#2/23.0/4.0/BL1), [Questions page](https://publiclab.org/questions), [Individual Tags page](https://publiclab.org/tag/air-quality), [Profile page](https://publiclab.org/profile/gautami_gg), [Tags page](https://publiclab.org/tags), [Dashboard](https://publiclab.org/dashboard) and [Main front page](https://publiclab.org/). We created issues for each page and then add checklist of tasks and assigned them to ourselves. This method has proved to be great in synchronising and breaking up of tasks.

For keeping a track of the to-do issues and completed issues/PR, we created a [github project](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/projects/10) and a main [planning issue](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/5739) which helped us record our progress. Technologies which I mainly worked on were Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, CSS and HTML.

### Future work : 

Even though GSoC has come to an end, I will be working on completing the front page and the dashboard which are not completely implemented. Also, since the UI revamp has a lot of corner cases which were left out, I will be working on the bugs in the UI as well. I would also like to work on redesigning the blog page which wasn't mentioned as our task for the summer. PublicLab is now converting their website pattern to be completely topic based, which requires a lot of brainstorming in the case of corner cases and their implementation. I will be a part of PublicLab in the future and will help in the UI improvements of the website.
