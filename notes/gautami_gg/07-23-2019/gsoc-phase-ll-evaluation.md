It's strange how time goes by so fast. It seems like only yesterday I was writing my proposal and here I am writing a blog for my second evaluation. I feel so lucky to have been selected as a GSoC participant in PublicLab and be a part of this amazing organisation. Every member here can say the same. From my first day of contribution till date, everyone has been so warm and welcoming. 

I have been collaborating with Lekhika for the past 1.5 months and working on the UI Improvements of the website. We create issues for each page and then add checklist of the tasks and assign them to ourselves. This method has proved to be great in synchronising and breaking up of tasks.

Currently, I am working on the pending issues and the profile page. We had a lot of confusion regarding the design and implementation of the profile page and on discussion with the mentors we came up with excellent solutions which can be seen here [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/6001](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/6001). Lekhika and I had an on-call meeting regarding this issue as well and we have started with the implementation of the profile page. 

I was inactive for a few days in between due to a minor ailment but now I am well and working with full force to complete all the tasks in the next two weeks. Lekhika and I are also working on the minor tweaks here and there as this is a UI improvement project which requires a lot of brushing up of the web pages. 

After the profile page, we will be working on the dashboard, the design for which is not ready yet. Since, the designs for the above two pages is still skeptical, the upcoming month will involve a lot of design discussions with the mentors.In the UI improvement project, I have mostly worked on the view files and the controllers for new feature addition. I have learned to write tests recently and have been reading about it lately. 

In the final month I will also be working on the In-app notification system and a Notification wall. [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/5745](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/5745)
I will be integrating activity\_notification gem and adding controllers and models for the same. Currently, we have notification system only for the comments, which can be extended to publishing a note/wiki or likes etc. I will start its implementation this week after discussing it with my fellow team partner Naman, who will be working on web push part of the notification system.   

My overall journey at PublicLab has been great so far. I have learned a lot in the last 3 months. I have loved collaborating and discussing the various issues and designs. I am looking forward to a lot of discussions and implementation in the final month. I am really excited for this last phase of GSoC which will involve summing up the work done so far and getting all the pieces together.  I really enjoyed my journey so far in GSoC with PublicLab and I am hoping the upcoming month will be just as exciting. I am looking forward to more design discussions with the mentors and fellow interns and implement the same in this final chapter of GSoC 2019\.
