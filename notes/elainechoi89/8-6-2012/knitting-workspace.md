Facilitating a workshop. 
Initially, all of us came to a an empty expansive outdated research facility loading dock, with a corner full of <em>stuff</em>. 

What takes to make a physical a space for learning, experimenting and collaborating. 

Seeking good lighting.
Tables for loads of materials that we brought, tables for literature, info and ect. (make shift from utilizing cardboard barrels, and a flat surface such as a white board). Some Balloons here and kites there, and of course, people. 

Although most of our acts involved settling, and pioneering ourselves a into the space to be comfortable working for the two days..after the workshop, there was not a trace of the event. The possibility of use of spaces open up much wider through methods of mobility, and temporary usage, which also cannot happen without peoples' labor.
