Giving last minute finishing touches to the rig. Balloon is in a take out container, just incase it gets damaged from the flight and travel. The Balloon Mapping tool will fly the high skies of Greensboro NC sky at the community gathering on Friday-Saturday at the Greenbean coffee shop.- with support and encouragement from Elizabeth Barry and Mathew Lippincott.
