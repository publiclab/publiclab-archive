# Kayak Deployment on 8/7/2014

###What I want to do
This note serves two purposes. 

First, this note demonstrates an approach to embedding external analyses in a PL research note using an iframe html tag. See [this note](http://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/08-11-2014/research-note-workflows) for more on this idea, and why we did it.

Second, it summarizes a kayak deployment of a riffle-ito water quality sensor to collect temperature transects with an Arduino/GPS shield to log locations. The goal was primarily to test the enclosure and see how the riffle-ito performed in the field. I also tried to detect a temperature signature from a wastewater treatment outfall.

###My attempt and results

The following is an embedded rmarkdown document that provides the data analysis. The data and source code for this analysis can be found on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/walkerjeffd/riffle-ito-apps/tree/master/analyses/20140807_kayak)
