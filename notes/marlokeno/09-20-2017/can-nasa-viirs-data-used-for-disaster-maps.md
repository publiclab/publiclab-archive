Looking at maps from the Suomi satellite of fires in the Western US, destruction of Rohingya villages- I wondered, how can this data be used after disasters like Harvey, Irma, Maria, Mexican earthquakes to help document damage and help communities recover?

  
For example, the burning organic peroxides of Arkema should show up well, and help the neighborhood document what really happened. A chronology showing how & where temperatures changed could be helpful. Fire temperatures may help narrow down which toxins were released.

  
Also, IR data can map damage to plants from flooding, wind, or pollution, and help track recovery progress-or lack.

Also, NOAA uses the SMAP (soil moisture) satellite to map flooding, which may be useful.  For example, there's a comparison of flooding, using SMAP, from Aug. 27 and Aug. 31 by Harvey [link text](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/harvey-atlantic-ocean) 

How do you look for oil sheen if the water's already receded?
