Anybody knowledgeable or experienced in using CALPUFF for particulate monitoring, or other air quality issues?
Second, will the EPA accept CALPUFF models of particulate dispersion?


###Recently, Gretchen G. posted that the EPA's AERMOD modeling, which is used in air quality permits, was not good because it ignored the conservation of mass. Gretchen, please correct anything that I got wrong or left out here.

I'm concerned because I think that air quality permits for sand mines, processing, and trans-loads are given using a bad model. The results of a bad model may be people breathing pollution.

The Wisconsin DNR uses some version of AERMOD, & appears to leave out the AERMAP step, which is the terrain modeling that's supposed to be included.

I keep coming across CALPUFF as an alternate. to AERMOD.

I wonder if its modelling is a better data fit than AERMOD.
I also wonder if anybody tests models with measurements, some kind of reliable evidence.
