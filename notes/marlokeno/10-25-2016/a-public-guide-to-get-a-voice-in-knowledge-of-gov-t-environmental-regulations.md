###Make a guide for public input options on local environment:
from the public for the public.

I want to put together a public guide, perhaps a wiki to air & water permitting, so, for example, people don't get caught with an approved CAFO in their neighborhood.
An example is the.Wisconsin DNR's ok public guide to air permitting, but they don't specify  a lot of grounds for objecting to a project. 
Also, Freedom of Information Act will be included, as, for example, the Fish & Wildlife Service releases little information on its findings without a FOIA request.
It's complicated, Clean Water Act, accessing EPA & state info, Army COE, the arcane USFWS, archaeology & Native grave preservation, not to mention air standards. And I've noticed that different EPA regions monitor & respond to violations differently.
And every state is different, though they all must meet Federal standards.
For a beginning, I'm going to work on the process for Wisconsin.

One state at a time is my limit; but I welcome input from others. Probably a wiki is the way to go.

###Questions: Too numerous to count.


###Reasons:
Too many times, I've been told the period for public comment has passed, a CAFO, pipeline, or mine has already been approved. The permits are often so technical that it's difficult to raise questions.
An Army Corps of Engineers official even told me that they, the informed people, needed to assess a proposal, and they didn't, yet, want to hear from the public.
