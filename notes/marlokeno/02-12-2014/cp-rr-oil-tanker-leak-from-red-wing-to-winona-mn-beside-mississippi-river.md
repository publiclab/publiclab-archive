# CP RR oil tanker leak from Red wing to Winona MN, beside Mississippi River

###I want to know how much oil spilled, what type of oil it is-reportedly, Bakken oil, and whether this will go into the Mississippi River.

###1) Mapping spill: https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zv0R1vU-ImQY.k8wN11uBjFhE
My attempt and results-Photographing spill- Weaver, MN, where train was reported to have sat for at least 45 minutes

### 1) The US Fish and Wildlife Service assessed this spill, with a verbal report that it was "very bad."
Is "very bad" quantifiable?
USFWS verbally said oil was in "small trout stream." Which one?0
If so, what are the figures? Newspaper reports: Tuesday spill, Wednesday 2000 gallons, Thursday, Mpls Tribune reported 12000 gallons of oil spilled. DOT-111 carries max of US 34, 500 gallons. {Reference-Wikipedia article re: DOT-111}
Will the oil flow, or has it already gone into the Mississippi River? What area/volume is it in now?
When spring thaw comes, where will the oil go?
How much oil spilled?
What kind of oil is this?
Will this affect birds migrating along the Mississippi Flyway?

### I'm interested-This needs work before people, wildlife and the Mississippi River suffer irreparable damage.
