###What I want to do Map offshore oil rigs

###My attempt and results l've been making a list of offshore supply vessels and big anchor handling vessels and gathering AIS data that I can get without a subscrition. 
Also, last week I found a website that gives weekly reports of mobile drilling units' location,using a variety of sources, such as mariner's reports.

An interesting side note: Brasil has 4  or 5 pollution control vessels, all named Mar Limpo *.
About a month ago, they changed their classification from "polluton control" to "fire fighting."
###Questions and next steps
My intent is to use this as a resource for keeping an eye on pollution of the sea by brasil
###Why I'm interested
I was curious about brasil because of all the new pre-salt drilling, Chevron's pollution, and the defective undersea pipeline built by BP.
The newest map I could find was from 2011.

Also, I began this to learn mapping skills for shipping LNG, Bakken and Alberta oil on Lake Superior in order to have some data in case of pollution there. 
(Superior's port isn't open yet; the Coast Guard started ice breaking about a week ago, reporting the ice to be 44" thick- the entire lake surface froze this winter.
This area around Superior is a bottleneck in the Mississippi migratory flyway, as the lake is narrowest there.)
