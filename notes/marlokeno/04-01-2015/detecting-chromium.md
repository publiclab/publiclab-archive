There may be chromium from a nearby landfill leaking into the surrounding aquifer and surface water.
Water from the aquifer, from a municipal well field 10 miles away tests at around 30 ppb. I believe that none has, yet, gotten, to this municipal well field.. The municipal wellfield draws on the same aquifer that surrounds the landfill; it's farther away than the area where the chromium may be.
What is the best way to tell if chromium is in the groundwater? Is there a test that for its presence, which would be relatively easy to do, before spending money for a certified lab analysis?
