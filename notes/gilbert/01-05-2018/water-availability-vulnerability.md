Although 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by water; 96.5% of such is oceanic water, leaving only 3.5% fresh water. 68.5% of that fresh water is within polar ice caps, glaciers and permanent snow. The remainder of fresh water resources are in the form of ground water, pallustrine water (swamp), riverine water (rivers), lacustrine water (lakes), atmospheric moisture and soil moisture.

**Lake Baikal in Eastern Siberia, Russia** contains 20% of the earth's non-frozen fresh water. Baikal is the world's oldest lake ast 25 million years and the world's deepest lake at 1,700 meters. Lake Baikal is also home to the world's only fresh water chemosynthetic benthic community and the only fresh water seal species - Nerpa (_Pusa Siberica_). Despite its apparent importance and value to humanity, Baikal is threatened:

- "A tourist boom, growing pollution and lack of sewage treatment has led to the disappearance of local fish species and a growth of putrid algae in Lake Baikal."The Guardian Oct. 19, 2017 "World's deepest lake crippled by putrid algae, poaching and pollution." Agence France-Presse Oct. 19, 2017
- "Hydroelectric dam project of Mongolian power companies, assisted by the World Bank which would imperil Lake Baikal by installing dams on the Selenga River, which flows into Lake Baikal."\[Kenneth Rapoza in the April 7, 2017 edition of Forbes\]

The scarcity of potable water is exacerbated by drought, desertification as well as by threats posed by water-borne diseases. Particularly within certain developing countries, where poverty and armed conflict combine to wreak havoc on vulnerable communities, water-borne diseases have become endemic. The following represent a non-exhaustive set of examples:
