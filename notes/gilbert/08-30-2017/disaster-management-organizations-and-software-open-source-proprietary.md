SUMMARY: DISASTER RESILIENCE

With the passage of sixteen years since the horrific acts of terror on September 11, 2001, the passage of twelve years since the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, the passage of seven years since the impact of the BP/Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, as well as the currently catastrophic impact of Hurricane Harvey (Attached Image Source: European Space Agency), it may be instructive to reflect on the array of organizations that have emerged to address the multi-hazard disasters, on technological advancements to address segments of the disaster life cycle, as well as on public policy changes and funding priorities that have been made recently, with respect to communities’ resilience to both anthropogenic and biogenic disasters.

The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identifies the five mission areas associated with emergency management as being: Prevention, Protection, Mitigation, Response & Recovery https://www.fema.gov/mission-areas . Clearly, the “Prevention” phase has proven to be the most challenging segment of the disaster management life cycle, both for biogenic and anthropogenic disasters.

Prevention: Although a plethora of subsequent FAA and TSA regulations may have significantly mitigated, if not fully prevented, the occurrence of such 9/11 airborne terrorist incidents, prevention of vehicular and/or armed terrorist incidents, such as those recently occurring in Paris, London, Barcelona, Charlottesville, VA, Orlando, FL and Charleston, SC, continues to require extraordinary vigilance on the part of law enforcement communities. Prevention of petrochemical industrial accidents, notwithstanding major court settlements and fines levied against British Petroleum and against Exxon in previous spills, may prove more difficult, given recent deregulation determinations and expansion of fossil fuel extraction permits in Alaska, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2017/08/01/the-energy-202-how-pruitt-s-hustle-to-deregulate-the-epa-may-bite-him/597f5db230fb045fdaef1019/?utm_term=.c776105931ef , West Virginia,

http://www.care2.com/causes/despite-health-concerns-trump-administration-halts-mountaintop-removal-study.html , etc. Particularly given the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Climate Accords, **http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/01/trump-pulls-out-of-the-paris-climate-agreement/ ** it is highly unlikely that, in foreseeable future we will achieve the capacity to prevent or mitigate the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events (e.g storms, drought and associated fire conditions).

Protection: There has been more progress with respect to certain disaster protection initiatives, in the form of early warning systems for famine, epidemic outbreaks, drought, tsunami notifications, hurricane warnings, tornado alerts, flood advisories, fire evacuation protocols, travel advisories and even terror risk level notifications. Given proposed severe budget cuts within NASA’s Earth Science Division, NOAA and the USGS, our capacity to access satellite data for early warning, as well as to monitor the rapidity of climate change would be greatly diminished.

Mitigation: Guidlelines for man-made earth impoundments or levees have been promulgated for at-risk communities, https://www.fema.gov/levee-system-construction-and-restoration-mapping-projects-overview ; funding finally provided for relocation of selected communities vulnerable to sea level rise and tidal surge, http://mashable.com/2016/02/18/america-first-climate-refugees/#qwo8KaHMoiqG ; http://www.lowlandercenter.org/ ; plans initiated for coastal wetland protection & restoration, http://coastal.la.gov/2017-coastal-master-plan/ inter alia.

Response: Governmental response to disasters continues to be augmented by both multilateral organizations and by NGO’s. Search and Rescue operations of the United States Coast Guard could be heavily impacted, given proposed budget cuts to that agency. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/04/us/politics/coast-guard-faces-challenges-at-sea-and-at-the-budget-office.html?mcubz=1 There continues to be collaboration among agencies, such as the International Red Cross, Salvation Army, Doctors Without Borders, Engineers Without Borders, Red Crescent, United Nations Disaster Relief Organization (UNDRO), World Health Organization (WHO), the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), etc. In the event of a declared major disaster, the International Charter- Space & Major Disasters can be invoked. Multi-governmental and private sector firms with earth-observing satellites, make their data freely available to the affected region, to aid in disaster response initiatives, whether naturally-caused (biogenic) or man-made (anthropogenic).

http://www.un-spider.org/space-application/emergency-mechanisms/international-charter-space-and-major-disasters

Recovery: The infrastructural, built environment, societal and economic recovery, whether subsequent to armed conflict, forced human migration, terrorism, nuclear power plant incident, earthquake, volcanic eruption, tsunami, major forest fire, mudslide, ebola outbreak or release of hazardous chemicals, all typically require a lengthy process, potential tediously slow insurance claims, litigation or legislation, extending well beyond the typical attention span of the media, humanitarian agencies, philanthropic organizations or governmental budgetary cycles. This is the segment of the disaster life cycle wherein university/community (i.e. town/gown) alliances have had some successes and where citizen science initiatives have empowered communities to document damage assessment and the road to recovery, through access to low cost and accessible environmental monitoring, reconstructive progress documentation and analytical technologies for assessment of water quality, air quality, agricultural productivity, biodiversity and evidence of environmental injustice.

Design/methodology/approach

– The qualitative testing of a conceptual framework of natural‐disaster response requirements through interviews with tsunami‐response logistics managers, the analysis of the findings in the light of tsunami‐hindsight “effective disaster management” themes of recent academic literature and multi‐agency reports and the development of the holistic, inclusive planning model.

Findings

– That natural disaster response activity needs to be viewed holistically in the context of a disaster management planning continuum that ideally starts well before the response action is required and of which locally‐led inclusiveness is a crucial component.

Research limitations/implications

– The model needs to be tested for its applicability as a planning instrument and guide for response activity in the context of future natural disasters.

Practical implications

– The holistic/inclusive planning model has been developed to guide natural disaster planners as well as add to academic discourse in the search for natural disaster management solutions.

Originality/value

– The study is original with its field‐based qualitative research foundation and reflective hindsight analysis.

Abstract: “Climate change, although a natural phenomenon, is accelerated by human activities. Disaster policy response to climate change is dependent on a number of factors, such as readiness to accept the reality of climate change, institutions and capacity, as well as willingness to embed climate change risk assessment and management in development strategies. These conditions do not yet exist universally. A focus that neglects to enhance capacity-building and resilience as a prerequisite for managing climate change risks will, in all likelihood, do little to reduce vulnerability to those risks. Reducing vulnerability is a key aspect of reducing climate change risk. To do so requires a new approach to climate change risk and a change in institutional structures and relationships. A focus on development that neglects to enhance governance and resilience as a prerequisite for managing climate change risks will, in all likelihood, do little to reduce vulnerability to those risks.”

Open Source Resources for major Disaster & Emergency Management Situations
By Peter Groen | October 30, 2012. Open Health News: The Voice of the Open Health Community.

As everyone knows by now, the super storm known as ‘Hurricane Sandy’ has caused considerable devastation across the East Coast of the United States and all the way up to the Great Lakes region. The effects of the storm will continue to be felt for days and weeks as major portions of the East Coast are without electricity and flooding is expected to continue for days.

Under these circumstances it seemed appropriate to put together a listing of open source applications that have been successfully used in emergencies and disaster recovery all over the world.
