Water Works, L3C, \[Miriam Belblidia, Co-Founder/CEO, [miriam@waterworks.com](mailto:miriam@waterworks.com)\] was formed in 2012 in order to integrate water management and foster collaboration among the different groups working to promote resilience and sustainability in our region. As a socially conscious company, we are committed to supporting community-driven solutions to address flooding, water pollution, and other hazard-related issues.

PublicLab \[Contacts: Gilbert Rochon, Advocacy Manager, [gilbert@publiclab.org](mailto:gilbert@publiclab.org) ; Stevie Lewis, Outreach Director, [stevie@publiclab.org](mailto:stevie@publiclab.org)\] is a community - supported by a non-profit - which develops and applies open-source tools to environmental exploration and investigation. By democratizing inexpensive and accessible Do-It-Yourself techniques, Public Lab creates a collaborative network of practitioners who actively re-imagine the human relationship with the environment. This community meeting is supported in part through a grant to Public Lab from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). \[Community Sandbagging Photo Credit - CBS Local Miami\]
