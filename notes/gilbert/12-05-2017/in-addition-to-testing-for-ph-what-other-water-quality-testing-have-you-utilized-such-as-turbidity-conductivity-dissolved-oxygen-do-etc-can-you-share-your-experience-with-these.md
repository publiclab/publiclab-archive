In responding to this question, would it be helpful to view Public Lab's spreadsheet on water sensors: [https://publiclab.org/wiki/water-sensors](https://publiclab.org/wiki/water-sensors) and/or Public Lab's wiki on pH Testing & Community Science: [https://publiclab.org/wiki/ph-testing-and-citizen-science](https://publiclab.org/wiki/ph-testing-and-citizen-science) ?
