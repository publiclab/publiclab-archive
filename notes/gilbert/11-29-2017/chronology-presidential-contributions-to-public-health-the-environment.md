During the term of the first president of the United States,
**George Washington (None; Federalist, 1789-1797)**,
the first ten amendments to the Constitution were ratified by the States on
Dec. 15, 1791 and have become enshrined as the "_Bill of Rights_." Subsequently, there has been a steady progression
of laws enacted, executive orders signed and court rulings issued, designed to
protect the health of human and animal populations and the ecosystems upon
which they depend for survival, beginning with the term of office of America's
second president, John Adams (1797-1801). With rare exceptions, such progress
in protections of public health and/or the environment within the USA continued
unabated, under Federalist, Democratic-Republican, Whig, National Union, Republican
and Democrat party presidencies. Shortly after January 20, 2017, consequent to
the inauguration of President Donald John Trump, the nation's 45th
President, the trend toward dismantling many of these protections for
environmental health and environmental sustainability appears to be
dramatically accelerating. Accordingly, it may be useful to review the timeline
for such legislation, court rulings, key appointments and executive orders, in
order to both place the contemporary de-regulations within their historical
context and to inform the strategy, going forward, for advocacy on behalf of
protecting both public health and environmental sustainability. A chronological
summary of such legislation, regulations, executive orders, appointments &
pertinent court rulings, during the terms of office of America's presidents,
follows:

<!-- more --\>

**President John Adams
(Federalist, 1797-1801)** signed the _Act
for the Relief of Sick and Disabled Seamen in 1798_, which consequently led
to establishment of marine hospitals along coastal and inland waterways. The
first such hospital opened at Washington Point, VA in 1801, during the first
year of office of **President** **Thomas Jefferson (Democratic-Republican, 1801-1809)**,
with others later opening in Boston, MA; Newport, RI; New Orleans, LA and
Charleston, SC. **President Abraham
Lincoln's (Republican, 1881-1865)** signing of the _1st Morrill Act in 1862_ established Landgrant
Universities in each state of the Union, which ultimately dramatically
contributed to food security and health care and economic development, through
instruction and research in agriculture, engineering, science, teacher
training, business and the humanities. Lincoln's signing the _Emancipation Proclamation_, one year
later in 1862 certainly led to very gradual improvement in the health and
quality of life for the 3,950,528 slaves of African descent in the United
States, according to the 1860 census, as well as for their descendants.

The trend toward expanding federal health care services
continued under **President Ulysses
Simpson Grant (Republican, 1869-1877),** who reorganized the _Marine Hospital Service_ in 1870,
appointed the 1st Supervising Surgeon (later referred to as Surgeon
General) in 1871 opened Marine Hospitals to Navy seamen in 1875\. In order to
prevent the spread of smallpox and yellow fever, **President Rutherford Brichard Hayes (Republican, 1877-1881)** signed
the _National Quarantine Act_ in 1878
and created the _National Board of Health_
in 1879\. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) traces its origins to a
one-room laboratory 1887, within the Marine Health Service (MHS), during the **presidency of Grover Cleveland (Democrat, 1885-1889
& 1893-1897)**, who also established the _Public Health Service Commissioned Officer Corps_ in 1889\. Congress
gave the MHS nation-wide quarantine authority in 1890, when **Benjamin Harrison was President (Republican,
1889-1893)**. In that same year, President Harrison signed the _2nd Morrill Act of 1890,_
which required the designation or establishment of historically Black Landgrant
Colleges in each State that refused to admit students of African descent to
their 1862 designated Landgrant Universities. As a result of this action,
eighteen predominantly Black Landgrant Universities, together with the array of
HBCU's now produce the vast majority of African-American physicians, nurses,
engineers, teachers, as well as a substantial contribution to African-American Masters
and Ph.D. degrees. Harrison also signed a New Quarantine Act in 1893,
consequent to cholera outbreaks in Europe.

During the **presidency
of** **William McKinley (Republican, 1897-1901)**,
congress assigned the\_Marine Hospital
Service to investigate leprosy in the USA\_ in 1899\. Shortly before his
assassination on Sept. 6, 1901 in Buffalo, NY, President McKinley signed the
appropriations bill for the _Hygienic
Laboratory_ on March 3, 1901\. \*\*President \*\***Theodore Roosevelt (Republican, 1901-1909)**
signed the bill in 1902 to transform the MHS into the Public Health &
Marine Hospital Service and the Biologics Control Act, "to
regulate the transportation or sale for human use of viruses, serums, vaccines,
antitoxins, and analogous products in interstate traffic or from any foreign
country into the United States." Teddy Roosevelt's major environmental
contribution was to sign the _American
Antiquities Act in 1906_, which established federal protection for
archeological sites on public lands, to preserve such historic, scientific,
commemorative, cultural heritage and monuments for future generations. The
eighteen monuments created by Teddy Roosevelt included the Grand Canyon and
Olympic National Park in Washington, the Petrified Forest in Arizona and El Moro
in New Mexico, together covering over one million acres. Additional National
Monuments were later designated under Teddy Roosevelt's legacy 1906 Antiquities
Act by Presidents Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Warren Gamble Harding, Calvin
Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B.
Johnson, Jimmy Carter, William J. Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

In 1912, **President Howard Taft** \*\*(\*\*\*\*Republican,\*\***1909-1913)** changed
the name of the Public Health & Marine Hospital Service to the _Public Health Service_ and expanded its
research mandate to include "diseases of man" and "contributing factors such as
pollution of navigable streams." **President
Woodrow Wilson's (Democrat, 1913-1921)** contributions to the environment and
to public health, respectively, included his signing the \_National Park Service Organic Act \_in 1916 and the _Chamberlain-Khan Act_ in 1918, which
authorized the study of venereal diseases and the Public Health Service Reserve
Corps to combat the 1918 influenza pandemic. It was **President Calvin** \*\*Coolidge (\*\*\*\*Republican,\*\***1923-1929)** in his
last year of office, 1929, who signed the _Narcotics
Control Act_, under which two hospitals to treat drug addicts were
authorized and a _Narcotics Division_
was established in the Public Health Service of the Surgeon General.

Two laws were signed in 1930 by \*\*President Herbert Clark Hoover (\*\*\*\*Republican,\*\***1929-1933)**,
specifically, the _Ransdell Act,_ to
designate the Hygienic Laboratory as the _National
Institute of Health_, establishment of a _Bureau
of Narcotics within the Treasury Dept_. and designation of the Public Health
Service's (PHS) Narcotics Division to emerge as the _Division of Mental Hygiene_. Major legislation related to public
health under \*\*President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt (Democrat, 1933-1945) \*\*included the _Social Security Act_ in 1935, which among other initiatives included
health grants to states to improve local public health programs and prevent the
interstate spread of disease, the establishment of the National Cancer
Institute in 1937and the _expansion of the
PHS Corps_ in 1944 to include commissioning of nurses, scientists,
dieticians, physical therapists and sanitarians. Two years later, in 1946, **President Harry S. Truman (Democrat, 1945-1953)**
approved establishment of the _Research
Grants Office_ within the PHS and signed the _National Mental Health Act_ "to improve the mental health of U.S.
citizens through research into the causes, diagnosis and treatment of
psychiatric disorders." Also in 1946, Truman signed the landmark _Hill-Burton Act_, which provided funding
to states to plan and construct hospitals and public health centers. For each
year of the next five years, Truman continued to approve congressional
contributions to Public Health, including authorization of a 600 bed clinical
research hospital in 1947, the _National
Microbiological Institute_, the \_Experimental
Biology and Medicine Institute \_and signed the _National Dental Research Act,_ all in 1948, the _National Institute of Mental Health_ in 1949 and the _Omnibus Medical Research Act_ in 1950,
which included the \_National Institute of
Neurological Diseases and Blindness \_and the _National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases._

The tradition of presidential
contributions to public health continued full-force under \*\*President Dwight David Eisenhower (\*\*\*\*Republican,\*\***1953-1961), **under****whose term of office the _Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW)_
was established in 1953, both the _Mental
Health Study Act_ was signed and the _National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases_ was established in 1955\. A
flurry of health-related legislation was signed by President Eisenhower was
signed during 1956, including initiation of _the
NIH Division of Research Services_, the National Health Survey Act, the _Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act_, the\_Health Amendments Act\_ and the _National Library of Medicine Act_. In
1958, Eisenhower signed the Mutual Security Act, which enabled "...collection,
translation and dissemination of scientific information and to conduct research
and support scientific activities overseas." This was followed by his signing
the International Health Research Act in 1960\.

During his short term of office
from 1961 to his assassination on Nov. 22, 1963, **President John Fitzgerald** **Kennedy
(Democrat, 1961-1963)** authorized the Natio\_nal Institute of General Medical Sciences \_and _the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development_, both
in 1962, and in 1963 amended the _Health
Facilities Act_ of 1956 to facilitate grants for multipurpose facilities for
teaching and essential research. On Oct. 31, 1963, only twenty-three days
before his untimely death, President Kennedy signed the _Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers
Construction Act_. The trend toward presidential support for public health
and environmental protections for the American public continued with the 1964
signing of the \_Wilderness Act \_by **President Lyndon Baines Johnson (Democrat, 1963-1969),
**as well as****_the Civil Rights Act_\*\*..., \*\*which
eventually allowed access to segregated health care facilities and educational
opportunities for millions of racial minority citizens. There were highly significant environmental
law signing contributions by **President
Richard Milhous Nixon (1969-1974)**, particularly the _Clean Air Act_ and the N\_ational
Environmental Policy Act \_(NEPA), both in 1970, as well as the _Clean Water Act_ in 1972 and the _Endangered Species Act_ in 1973\.

During the term of office of **President Gerald R. Ford (Republican, 1974-1977)**,
_the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
was authorized to regulate toxic chemicals_ and during the prolific term of
office of **President James Earl "Jimmy"
Carter (Democrat, 1977-1981)**, the country benefitted from establishment of
the _Task force on Environmental Cancer
and Heart and Lung Disease_ and signing of the _amendment to the Clean Air Act_, the initiation of the _Food and Agriculture Act_, the _Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments_
and the\_Saccharin Study and Labeling Act\_,
all in 1977\. President Carter also signed _extensions
of the Community Mental Health Centers Act_ and the _Family Planning, Population and SIDS Amendments_, both in 1978, as
well as in 1979 established the _Department
of Health and Human Services_, and _the
Emergency Medical Services Systems Amendments and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
Amendments_ of 1979, further requiring "conduct of a study to determine _the effect of aging on the ability of
individuals to perform duties of pilots_." In 1980, **President Jimmy Carter** further commissioned the Secretary of HHS "to
conduct a study to determine the long-term effects of hypochloremic metabolic
ankylosis resulting from chloride-deficient formulas;" created the federal
"Superfund" to clean-up toxic waste sites; revised and re-authorized the _National Institute of Arthritis, Diabetes_
and _Digestive and Kidney Diseases_;
and mandated research on _spinal cord
regeneration and neurological disorders_.

Throughout the 1980's, **President
Ronald Wilson Reagan (Republican, 1981-1989)**, although advocating weakening
certain environmental regulations, which would have adversely impacted
enforcement of the Clean Air Act & Clean Water Act, had they not been
subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court, did make significant contributions
to public health. In particular, reauthorizing the _National Research Service Awards_ and the _Medical Libraries Assistance Program_ in 1981; establishment of the
Small Business Innovation Research (_SBIR_)
Program in 1982; the \_Orphan Drug Act \_(to
promote development of pharmaceuticals for rare diseases), funding for NIH AIDS
research and development of a Biomedical Information Communications Center, all
in 1983; the _Mary Woodard Lasker Center for Health Research and Education_, as
well as the \_National Organ Transplant Act
\_and the _Veterans' Dioxin and
Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act_, each in 1984\. The \_Food Security Act \_of 1985 amended the
Animal Welfare Act to establish standards for the humane treatment of animals.
Also in 1985, under President Reagan, an information service was established at
the _National Agricultural Library_, in
collaboration with the _National Library
of Medicine._

During President Reagan's tenure, NIH's budget suffered
major reductions, initially reduced by $236 million and ultimately a 4.3%
overall reduction below the 1986 appropriation, as a result of both
sequestration and _the Balanced Budget and
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985_ (_Gramm-Rudman-Hollings_).
In the 1986 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriation bill, which President Reagan
signed, $70 million was allocated for _AIDS
research_ and $4.5 million was provided for construction of the \_Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center \_in West
Virginia. Moreover, in 1986 President Reagan signed the _Urgent Supplemental Appropriations Act_, which included additional
funding for cancer research and an equitable pay structure for VA nurses; the _Federal Technology Transfer Act_,
authorizing federal collaborative R&D agreements, including inter-agency
and with universities and private sector; the _Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Services Research Act_;
established _Advisory Commission on
Childhood Vaccines_; and the following year signed the _Older Americans Act Amendments_, which, inter alia, authorized the
President to call a _White House
Conference on Aging_ in 1991\.

The NIH in 1988, was provided $7.152 billion in the
Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Act of 1989, including a 1.2% reduction and
a line item designation of $96 million for a new _National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders_.
Three additional Public Laws were signed by President Reagan in 1988, including
a stipulation for _special pay retention
bonuses for certain medical officers,_ under the _National Defense Authorization Act_; _grants to states to provide life-prolonging medication for AIDS
patients_; the _National Deafness and
Other Communication Disorders Act_; the _Health
Omnibus Programs Extension_; as well as establishment of \_National Center for Biotechnology Information,\_\_National Commission on Sleep Disorders,\__National Commission on AIDS,_ an _Office of AIDS Research_, a _loan repayment program for NIH scientists
engaged in AIDS research_, as well \_as
purchase of an advanced design supercomputer \_under the _Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and
Related Agencies Appropriations Act._

In November of 1989, **President
Herbert Walker Bush, Republican,** who served from **1989-1993**, signed into law a provision providing for the _construction of biomedical facilities_
and "a _continued supply of specialized
strains of mice essential to biomedical research._" He also signed six
pertinent pieces of legislation in 1990, such as _Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act_; the \_Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act \_of 1990, "to review periodically
the _appropriate frequency for performing
screening mammography_;" _Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990_, required NIEHS _to
conduct a study of mercury exposure_; stipulated membership on the _Mickey Leland Urban Air Toxics Research
Center_ ; established an _inter-agency task force on air pollution_;
and authorized an NIEHS program of _basic
research on human health risks from air pollutants._ (P.L. 101-549).
Additionally, in 1990, President H.W. Bush authorized the _National Foundation for Biomedical Research_; created the _National Center for Medical Rehabilitation
Research_; signed the _Hazardous
Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act_; the _Transplant Amendments of 1990_; and reauthorized the _National Bone Marrow Donor Registry_. The
following year, President H.W. Bush's signed Appropriations Act _established NCI's Matsunaga-Conte Prostate
Cancer Research Center_, and a _women's
health study_. The \_Postal Service and
General Government Appropriations Act, \_1991, established the _PHS senior biomedical research service_
and "_The High Performance Computing Act
of 1991_, authorized Federal agencies such as NIH to allow recipients of
research grant funds to pay for computer networking expenses."

The George H.W. Bush administration continued with its
public health-related initiatives through 1992, such as _American Technology Preeminence Act,_ enabling NIH to give excess
research equipment to non-profit organizations and educational institutions for
research activities and scientific and technical education; signed the _Cancer Registries Act_; the _Preventive Health Amendments_; the _SBIR Enhancement Act_; the _Housing and Community Development Act_ of
1992, for conducting "...\_a study of the
sources of lead exposure in children who have elevated blood lead levels \_(or
other indicators of elevated lead body burden);" and the \_National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Authorization Act,
\_facilitating "_biomedical research
activities in areas where microgravity environment_ may contribute to
significant progress in the understanding and treatment of diseases and other
medical conditions... "and to "_conduct
of joint biomedical research activities by the republics of the former Soviet
Union and the United States_."

**President William
Jefferson Clinton**,\*\*Democrat, \*\*throughout
his presidency **1993-2001**, had an
extensive record of achievement, as relates to both public health and the
environment. Accordingly, the associated legislation and executive orders
pertaining to each are separated herein. With respect to Public Health, in his

of 40%; and the Clean Power Plan, (temporarily held up by the Supreme Court).

In sharp contrast, not only to the Obama and Clinton
presidencies, but also to virtually every other Democrat, Republican,
Democratic-Republican, Federalist or Whig Party United States President, the
current administration of **President
Donald John Trump (January 20, 2017 to present)** has systematically
deregulated environmental and public health protections, for example reversing
precedents set over a hundred years ago by Republican President Theodore
Roosevelt's signing of the Wilderness Act, and "reviewing" the landmark Clean
Water Act and Clean Air Act congressional laws singed by Republican President
Richard Milhous Nixon. A summary of President Trumps pertinent executive orders
and regulatory changes follows:

**"Some other rules were reinstated
after legal challenges. Environmental groups have sued the Trump administration
over many of the proposed rollbacks, and, in some cases, have succeeded in
reinstating environmental rules." (Popovich & , op. cit., 2017):**

1\. Delayed by one year a compliance deadline
for new **ozone pollution
standards**,
but later reversed course

Mr. Pruitt
initially [delayed the compliance deadline](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/us/politics/ozone-trump-obama-climate-change.html) for a 2015
national ozone standard, but [reversed course](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/climate/epa-reverses-course-on-ozone-rule.html) after 15 states and the District
of Columbia sued.

2\. Delayed publishing **efficiency
standards for household appliances**

After being sued by a
number of states and environmental groups for failing to publish efficiency
standards for appliances including heaters, air conditioners and refrigerators,
the Trump administration released its rules on May 26\.

3\. Reinstated rule limiting the\*\*\*\***discharge of mercury by
dental offices** into municipal sewers

The E.P.A. reinstated an
Obama-era rule that regulated the disposal of dental amalgam, a filling
material that contains mercury and other toxic metals. The agency initially put
the rule on hold as part of a broad regulatory freeze, but environmental groups
sued. The American Dental Association came out in support of the rule.

\*\*\[N.B. It should be noted that, while extolling the contributions of US Presidents to Public Health & to the Environment, the infamous syphilis study under the auspices of the U.S. Public Health Service was conducted in Tuskegee, Alabama, from 1932 to 1972, (i.e. from Presidents Herbert Hoover through Richard Nixon), which deprived African-American men of medical treatment long after effective therapeutics were available. It was not until May 16, 1997 that President Bill Clinton offered his official apology for the atrocities that occurred during the terms of office of his predecessors.\]\*\*
