### [2.To](http://2.To) Briefly Describe Various Types of Water Testing, such as Turbidity, pH, Conductivity:

The array of characteristics and content for which water resources are tested may include: Turbidity ([USGS: "Turbidity ](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/turbidity.html)is the measure of relative clarity of a liquid. It is an optical characteristic of water and is an expression of the amount of light that is scattered by material in the water when a light is shined through the water sample"), pH (Measure of the acidity or basicity of water soluble substances), Conductivity (Measure of a solution's ability to conduct electricity, as measured in Siemens per meter (S/m), E. Coli (Escherichia coli), Nitrates and total Nitrogen, Ammonia, Phosphates and total Phosphorus, total dissolved solids,DO (Dissolved Oxygen), Salinity, Temperature, Alkalinity, Trace metals and organics, and in the case of swimming pools, Chlorine.

### 3\. To Compile Selected Regulations Pertaining to Water Quality at the International, Federal & State Levels, as well as Identifiable Recent Changes, with Assistance from the Broader Online Community:

The motivation for compiling this report is the recognition that global water resources are imperiled ([UN FAO Review of World Water Resources by Country](http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/Y4473E/Y4473E00.HTM); [FAO Aquastat](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_res/index.stm); [World Bank Water Resources Data](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTMENA/Resources/App-all-Scarcity.pdf)) and that the public health of individuated communities and the sustainability of their environments are at increased risk, given rapid and rampant deregulation of environmental resource protections ([E.P.A. Moves to Rescind Contested Water Pollution Regulation](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/climate/epa-rescind-water-pollution-regulation.html), NY Times, by Coral Davenport, June 27, 2017), as well as the deference given to industrial non-compliance with existing regulations, thereby freeing corporations to either sidestep regulations or else to comply or even to exceed them for reasons other than fear of enforcement (["Social License and Environmental Protection: Why Businesses Go beyond Compliance"](http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1674&context=facpubs) Neil Gunningham, 29 Law & Soc. Inquiry 307, 2004).

Moreover, the devolution of regulatory authority and of environmental monitoring (["52 Environmental Rules on the Way Out Under Trump,"](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/climate/trump-environment-rules-reversed.html) by NADJA POPOVICH and LIVIA ALBECK-RIPKA UPDATED Oct. 6, 2017 NY Times) and official governmental adherence to counter-scientific denial of the reality and impacts of climate change ("[U.S. submits formal notice of withdrawal from Paris climate pact," by Valerie Volcovici,](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-climate-usa-paris/u-s-submits-formal-notice-of-withdrawal-from-paris-climate-pact-idUSKBN1AK2FM) Reuters. AUGUST 4, 2017 / 4:25 PM), as well as expanding urbanization and its impact on peri-urban fragile ecosystems ([Environmental Impacts of Urban Growth](http://urban.yale.edu/research/theme-4) - Yale U. Seto Lab), makes it imperative for local communities to develop self-sufficiency with respect to affordable environmental monitoring, analytical technologies and associated capacity building for indigenous expertise, peer production and advocacy.

Parameters for determining water quality are dependent upon the intended end-use of the water resource. More stringent testing guidelines/standards/regulations/legislation for drinking water have been promulgated by the [World Health Organization (WHO)](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/water-quality/guidelines/en/) , the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),](https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations) the[Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/regulations.html), the [U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA](https://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm046894.htm)) for bottled drinking water, by certain individual states, such as [California](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/Chemicalcontaminants.shtml) and by an array of foreign governments, including [Canada ](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/environmental-workplace-health/water-quality/drinking-water/canadian-drinking-water-guidelines.html), the [European Union](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-drink/legislation_en.html), [South Africa](http://www.waternet.co.za/policy/g_wq.html), [Kenya](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/536fb913e4b03c6512282450/attachments/57864937903360751e722426/Water-Quality-&-Effluent-Monitoring-Guidelines.pdf), [Australia](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/eh52), [China](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61884-4/abstract), [South American Countries](http://www.dec.ufv.br/modules/mastop_publish/files/PublicacoesdoPrograma/bastos/Journal%20of%20Water%20and%20Health_10%202_2012.pdf), [Russia](http://www.cabri-volga.org/DOC/PolicyRoundtable/WaterCodeOfRF-UnofficialEnglishTranslation.pdf), etc. Guidelines for water quality considered safe for recreational activities, including swimming, have been issued by the [U.S. EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/rec-factsheet-2012.pdf) and specifically by the EPA for [coastal and Great Lakes recreational waters](https://www.epa.gov/beach-tech/final-water-quality-standards-bacteria-rule-coastal-and-great-lakes-recreation-waters). Guidelines for swimming pools, spas and recreational waters have also been issued by the [National Science Foundation (NSF)](http://www.nsf.org/services/by-type/standards-publications/water-wastewater-standards/pool-spa-rec-water-standards) and by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/aquatics-professionals/regulation-inspection.html). [State-specific water quality standards ](https://www.epa.gov/wqs-tech/state-specific-water-quality-standards-effective-under-clean-water-act-cwa)under the Clean Water Act are accessible through an EPA map-based format.

The acceptable standards for sustainable recreational and commercial fishing are to some degree dependent upon both species, season and state regulations, e.g. [Wisconsin Trout Fishing Regulations 2017-2018](http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/fishing/regulations/troutregs.html), [North Carolina Rainbow Trout Regulations](http://www.ncwildlife.org/Learning/Species/Fish/Rainbow-Trout), [Florida Bass Fishing Regulations](https://www.wuft.org/news/2016/07/01/new-florida-black-bass-fishing-regulations-in-effect/), [2017 Louisiana Recreational Shrimping Regulations](http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/fishing/recreational-shrimping), [Maine - Lobster Regulations](http://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/species/lobster/guide/index.html), [Alabama Saltwater fishing](http://www.outdooralabama.com/saltwater-fishing-alabama) and [Alabama freshwater fishing](http://www.outdooralabama.com/freshwater-fishing). The EPA in the past periodically issued recommendations with respect to the water quality required in certain municipalities related to recreational use of water, e.g. boating, kayaking and canoeing, as was the case in [Chicago](https://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/0/D25839BBAE91C1388525788E0036DA49). Similar water quality regulations for boating and recreational water use have emerged from the [Washington \[DC\] Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC)](https://www.wsscwater.com/watershedregs), by the [Iowa Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR)](http://www.iowadnr.gov/Things-to-Do/Canoeing-Kayaking) for canoeing & kayaking, and by [Massachusetts for boat fishing](http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dcr/watersupply/watershed/quabbinaccessch4d.pdf) in the Quabbin Reservoir.

Less stringent requirements would normally apply to water usage for agricultural irrigation. Guidelines have been issued by multilateral organizations concerning the use of wastewater and sludge for agricultural use, such as by the United Nation's [Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO)](http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/T0234E/T0234E00.htm), by the [U.S. EPA](https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/mstr-ch7.pdf), as well as for agricultural irrigation water quality in specific states, e.g. [California](https://www.ccof.org/blog/california-farmers-and-ranchers-must-comply-water-quality-regulations) and [Oregon](http://www.oregon.gov/ODA/shared/Documents/Publications/NaturalResources/WaterQualityandAgriculture.pdf) and in specific countries, such as in [India](http://164.100.105.199:8071/tmp/SR11624.pdf) and in [Saudi Arabia](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1018363910000024).

State-Specific Water Quality Standards Effective under the Clean Water Act (CWA) US EPA [https://www.epa.gov/wqs-tech/state-specific-water-quality-standards-effective-under-clean-water-act-cwa](https://www.epa.gov/wqs-tech/state-specific-water-quality-standards-effective-under-clean-water-act-cwa)

The degree to which water quality is regulated and the degree to which such regulations are enforced is highly dependent upon evolving (or devolving) policies and the implementation thereof at international, federal, state, county and even municipal levels. Risks associated with consumption and/or exposure to contaminated water resources are abundant. Areas of concern have included leaching of lead pipes into water supplies in [New Orleans, LA](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/louisiana/articles/2017-07-20/new-orleans-official-warns-of-lead-threats-in-tap-water); as well as major copper and lead contamination of tap water in [Flint, Michigan](http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/07/flint_reports_on_water_quality.html).

Readers aware of recent changes in their state legislation, county/municipal ordinances or court judgements within their own communities, with respect to water quality, environmental sustainability and/or public health are urged to share their contributions to the broader network, so as to build capacity for collaboration, strengthened advocacy and development of a geospatial database for environmental deregulation, vulnerable ecosystems and populations at-risk.

### 4\. To Identify Certain Water-Borne Diseases Associated with Pollution/Contamination of Water Quality:

Globally, waterborne diseases present significant challenges, particularly with respect to:

Costs, Highlighting Low-Cost Tools Developed through Peer Production, and Invite Contributors to Update: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wxzexr5ZqYjYOEEOI-UHcvVJP9yKl2mEXfmEg8w2ch4/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wxzexr5ZqYjYOEEOI-UHcvVJP9yKl2mEXfmEg8w2ch4/edit#gid=0)

### 6\. To Showcase Successful Advocacy on Behalf of Communities'Sustainable Clean Water Resources & Public Health and to

Earnestly Encourage Community Contributed Answers to Remaining Questions:

1. Can you share details on any recent changes in environmental regulations or court rulings, particularly as relates to water quality, in the State where you reside?
2. Have you had direct experience using water testing devices in your local community and, if so, will you share your assessment of such device(s), the type of tests conducted, such as pH, turbidity or conductivity, and the results you achieved?
3. Which community advocacy organizations have you found to be most helpful in addressing environmental, public health and/or community sustainable development concerns in your locality?
4. What specific water quality issues have recently emerged in your region , such as "boil water alerts," "swimming bans," "no fishing advisories," "no shell-fish or bi-valve consumption recommendations," "water-borne disease outbreaks," "industrial spills," "contaminated flooding," "unusual water taste, color or smell," "bottled water purchase directives"?
5. Have there been any local responses, complaints, protests, demonstrations or litigation, with respect to federal and/or state regulatory changes, such as deregulation impacting the Clean Water Act, mining, facking, endangered species protections, public land-use permit practices, etc. ?
6. Has your community experienced any successes in attempts to protect or clean-up local water resources? If so, was this success achieved largely through community engagement, media attention, affiliative support from local colleges/universities, actively supportive politicians, industrial partnerships, foundation founding, state legislation/city ordinances, federal enforcement, judicial consent decrees, a combination of such factors or through other initiatives not listed herein?
7. Is your community engaged with on-line networks with other communities and advocacy organizations, supporting your community's water quality, environmental sustainability, public health and/or economic development? If so, which network(s)? If not, are you interested in joining Public Lab's email list?
