A
Victory for Clean Water: Citizen Science Data Leads to Change

June

For
years, the [Mystic River Watershed Association (MyRWA)](https://mysticriver.org/) and its volunteers have helped
to document water pollution problems in the Town of Belmont. This week, that
hard work paid off.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued an [Administrative Order on Consent](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-takes-steps-improve-water-quality-mystic-tributaries-downstream-belmont-mass) with
the Town of Belmont over years of water quality damages. Over the next five
years the town has agreed to make a significant investment in repairs to its
storm water system, which is discharging pollutants, including human sewage,
into waters of the Mystic River watershed. We congratulate Belmont on their
commitment to improve water quality to tributaries to Alewife Brook.

This is a success story for citizen science and for non-profit environmental
collaboration with government agencies. Data acquired by MyRWA volunteers and
shared with EPA was key to making progress. This has been a group effort---from
the dozens of volunteer monitors who go out each month to collect samples, to
the tireless work of others like Roger Frymire, who spent countless hours
finding sources of pollution in the Alewife Brook area.

Since 2000, volunteers through the MyRWA's [Baseline
Monitoring Program](https://mysticriver.org/baseline) have generated water quality data that is
shared with state and federal agencies. Each year the EPA in conjunction with
MyRWA issues a water quality report card for the Mystic River watershed.

The 2015 [water quality report card](https://mysticriver.org/epa-grade) for the Belmont
area tells the story: Alewife Brook earned a D grade with 50% compliance with
boating and swimming standards for bacteria; Little River a D- grade at 44%
compliance; and Winn's Brook an F grade at 33% compliance.

One powerful aspect of the Baseline Monitoring Program is that it is poised to
document success as well as problems. As infrastructure repairs are made in
Belmont, we fully expect these grades to improve. We look forward to
documenting and celebrating water quality improvements to Alewife Brook, Little
River, Winn's Brook, Wellington Brook---and the Mystic River itself---over the next
five years!

**Congratulations** and thanks to everyone who continues to work with
us for protecting clean water.
