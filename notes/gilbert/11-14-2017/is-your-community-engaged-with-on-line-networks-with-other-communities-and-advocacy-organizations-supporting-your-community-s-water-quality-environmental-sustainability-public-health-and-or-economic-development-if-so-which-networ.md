We are attempting to identify the optimal array of on-line community networks in order to maximize successful advocacy. Your sharing information on the networks that you and/or your community organizations have found to be most helpful would benefit the struggle for sustainable natural resources and public health.

Are you or your community engaged with other online networks of communities and advocacy organizations, with the mission of supporting your community's water quality, environmental sustainability, public health and/or economic development? If so, which network(s)? Thank you!
