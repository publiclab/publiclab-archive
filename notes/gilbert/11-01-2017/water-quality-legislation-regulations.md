**WATER QUALITY LEGISLATION, REGULATIONS & AVAILABILITY:**

**\[Photo Credit: Mass Seal Deaths (Nerpa) on Lake Baikal, Siberia. Moscow Times, Oct. 31, 2017\]**

Notwithstanding the fact that approximately [71% of the surface of
planet Earth is covered by water, 96.5% is oceanic water,](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthhowmuch.html) leaving only 3.5%
as "fresh water". Of that fresh water total, 68.7% is in the polar ice caps,
glaciers and permanent snow. The remainder is distributed among lakes, rivers, swamps, groundwater, atmospheric water vapor, soil moisture and permafrost.

The
vulnerability of lacustrine water is dramatically illustrated in the case [of Lake Baikal, a UNESCO World
Heritage Centre](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/754) site in South-Eastern Siberia, the world's oldest lake
(twenty-five million years), the world's deepest lake (over 5,000 ft./ 1,700 m.),
[holding
20% of the planet's unfrozen freshwater](http://siberiantimes.com/science/casestudy/features/lake-baikal-to-become-a-new-ocean-but-not-for-20-million-years-say-scientists/) (23,000 cubic km.). Kenneth Rapoza in the [April
7, 2017 edition of Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2017/04/07/in-russia-the-worlds-largest-lake-takes-on-the-world-bank-and-mongolian-power-build-up/#48128a6d4df5), reports on a hydroelectric dam project of
Mongolian power companies, assisted by the World Bank which would imperil Lake
Baikal by installing dams on the Selenga River, which flows into Lake Baikal.
The Lake is also home to the world's only freshwater benthic community, to a
wide array of indigenous flora & aquatic life, and the world's only
freshwater seal species, nerpa (_Pusa
sibirica_). The [October
31, 2017 edition of the Moscow Times](https://themoscowtimes.com/news/russian-authorities-investigating-mass-seal-59425) reported "**Russian Authorities
Investigating Mass Seal Deaths in Lake Baikal!" **\[[https://themoscowtimes.com/static/uploads/publications/2017/10/31/7f672a26ab1b4987a9d256f0c94e8b36.jpg](https://themoscowtimes.com/static/uploads/publications/2017/10/31/7f672a26ab1b4987a9d256f0c94e8b36.jpg)\](file:///C:/Users/gilbe/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip\_image002.jpg)****

"Approximately
132 seal carcasses were discovered at three locations near Lake Baikal...Reports
earlier this month [indicated](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/19/lake-baikal-russia-crippled-algae-fish-poaching-pollution) that
a tourist boom, growing pollution and lack of sewage treatment has led to the
disappearance of local fish species and a growth of putrid algae in Lake
Baikal."

Given humanity's dependence upon potable water for basic
survival, it is becoming increasingly evident that action must be taken to
protect imperiled global water resources. ([UN FAO Review of World Water
Resources by Country](http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/Y4473E/Y4473E00.HTM); [FAO
Aquastat](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_res/index.stm); [World
Bank Water Resources Data](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTMENA/Resources/App-all-Scarcity.pdf)) and that the public health of
individuated communities and the sustainability of their environments are at
increased risk, given rapid and rampant deregulation of environmental resource
protections ([E.P.A.
Moves to Rescind Contested Water Pollution Regulation](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/climate/epa-rescind-water-pollution-regulation.html), NY Times, by
Coral Davenport, June 27, 2017), as well as the deference given to industrial
non-compliance with existing regulations, thereby freeing corporations to
either sidestep regulations or else to comply or even to exceed them for
reasons other than fear of enforcement (["Social
License and Environmental Protection: Why Businesses Go beyond Compliance"](http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1674&context=facpubs) Neil
Gunningham, 29 Law & Soc. Inquiry 307, 2004).

Moreover, the devolution of regulatory authority and of
environmental monitoring (["52
Environmental Rules on the Way Out Under Trump,"](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/climate/trump-environment-rules-reversed.html) by Nadja
Popovich and Livia Albeck-Ripka Updated Oct. 6, 2017 NY Times) and official
governmental adherence to counter-scientific denial of the reality and impacts
of climate change ("[U.S.
submits formal notice of withdrawal from Paris climate pact," by Valerie
Volcovici,](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-climate-usa-paris/u-s-submits-formal-notice-of-withdrawal-from-paris-climate-pact-idUSKBN1AK2FM) Reuters. August 4, 2017 / 4:25 PM), as well as
expanding urbanization and its impact on peri-urban fragile ecosystems ([Environmental Impacts of Urban Growth](http://urban.yale.edu/research/theme-4) -
Yale U. Seto Lab), makes it imperative for local communities to develop
self-sufficiency with respect to affordable environmental monitoring,
analytical technologies and associated capacity building for indigenous
expertise, peer production and advocacy. While officials in New Jersey were
commemorating the [45th
Anniversary of the Clean Water Act](http://www.centraljersey.com/news/independent/stories/officials-commemorate-the-th-anniversary-of-the-clean-water-act/article_ff1185c5-66ee-5ad7-9008-9861274d9754.html), the US EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced
[a
review of both the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act](https://cleantechnica.com/2017/10/31/us-epa-review-clean-air-act-clean-water-act-search-regulatory-burdens/) in order to "reduce
unnecessary regulatory burdens" on business.

**Drinking Water:**

Parameters for determining water quality are dependent upon the
intended end-use of the water resource. More stringent testing
guidelines/standards/regulations/legislation for drinking water have been
promulgated by the [World
Health Organization (WHO)](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/water-quality/guidelines/en/) , the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA),](https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations) the [Centers for
Disease Control & Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/regulations.html), the [U.S.
Food & Drug Administration (FDA](https://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm046894.htm)) for bottled drinking water, by
certain individual states, such as [California](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/Chemicalcontaminants.shtml) and
by an array of foreign governments, including [Canada ](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/environmental-workplace-health/water-quality/drinking-water/canadian-drinking-water-guidelines.html),
the [European
Union](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-drink/legislation_en.html), [South
Africa](http://www.waternet.co.za/policy/g_wq.html), [Kenya](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/536fb913e4b03c6512282450/attachments/57864937903360751e722426/Water-Quality-&-Effluent-Monitoring-Guidelines.pdf), [Australia](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/eh52), [China](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61884-4/abstract), [South
American Countries](http://www.dec.ufv.br/modules/mastop_publish/files/PublicacoesdoPrograma/bastos/Journal%20of%20Water%20and%20Health_10%202_2012.pdf), [Russia](http://www.cabri-volga.org/DOC/PolicyRoundtable/WaterCodeOfRF-UnofficialEnglishTranslation.pdf),
etc.

**Swimming:**

Guidelines for water quality considered safe for recreational activities,
including swimming, have been issued by the [U.S.
EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/rec-factsheet-2012.pdf) and specifically by the EPA for [coastal
and Great Lakes recreational waters](https://www.epa.gov/beach-tech/final-water-quality-standards-bacteria-rule-coastal-and-great-lakes-recreation-waters). Guidelines for swimming pools,
spas and recreational waters have also been issued by the [National
Science Foundation (NSF)](http://www.nsf.org/services/by-type/standards-publications/water-wastewater-standards/pool-spa-rec-water-standards) and by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/aquatics-professionals/regulation-inspection.html). [State-specific
water quality standards ](https://www.epa.gov/wqs-tech/state-specific-water-quality-standards-effective-under-clean-water-act-cwa)under the Clean Water Act are
accessible through an EPA map-based format.

**Fishing:**

The acceptable standards for sustainable recreational and
commercial fishing are to some degree dependent upon both species, season and
state regulations, e.g. [Wisconsin
Trout Fishing Regulations 2017-2018](http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/fishing/regulations/troutregs.html), [North
Carolina Rainbow Trout Regulations](http://www.ncwildlife.org/Learning/Species/Fish/Rainbow-Trout), [Florida
Bass Fishing Regulations](https://www.wuft.org/news/2016/07/01/new-florida-black-bass-fishing-regulations-in-effect/), [2017
Louisiana Recreational Shrimping Regulations](http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/fishing/recreational-shrimping), \[Maine Lobster Regulations\] ([http://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/species/lobster/guide/index.html](http://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/species/lobster/guide/index.html)), [Alabama
Saltwater fishing](http://www.outdooralabama.com/saltwater-fishing-alabama) and [Alabama freshwater fishing](http://www.outdooralabama.com/freshwater-fishing).

**Boating:**

The EPA in the past periodically issued recommendations with respect to the
water quality required in certain municipalities related to recreational use of
water, e.g. boating, kayaking and canoeing, as was the case in [Chicago](https://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/0/D25839BBAE91C1388525788E0036DA49).
Similar water quality regulations for boating and recreational water use have
emerged from the [Washington
\[DC\] Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC)](https://www.wsscwater.com/watershedregs), by the [Iowa Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR)](http://www.iowadnr.gov/Things-to-Do/Canoeing-Kayaking) for
canoeing & kayaking, and by [Massachusetts
for boat fishing](http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dcr/watersupply/watershed/quabbinaccessch4d.pdf) in the Quabbin Reservoir.

**Irrigation:**

Less stringent requirements would normally apply to water usage
for agricultural irrigation. Guidelines have been issued by multilateral organizations
concerning the use of wastewater and sludge for agricultural use, such as by
the United Nation's [Food & Agriculture Organization
(FAO)](http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/T0234E/T0234E00.htm), by the [U.S. EPA](https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/mstr-ch7.pdf), as well as for
agricultural irrigation water quality in specific states, e.g. [California](https://www.ccof.org/blog/california-farmers-and-ranchers-must-comply-water-quality-regulations) and [Oregon](http://www.oregon.gov/ODA/shared/Documents/Publications/NaturalResources/WaterQualityandAgriculture.pdf) and
in specific countries, such as in [India](http://164.100.105.199:8071/tmp/SR11624.pdf) and in [Saudi
Arabia](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1018363910000024).

**State Regulations:**

The degree to which water quality is regulated and the degree to
which such regulations are enforced is highly dependent upon evolving (or
devolving) policies and the implementation thereof at international, federal,
state, county and even municipal levels. Risks associated with consumption
and/or exposure to contaminated water resources are abundant. Areas of concern
have included leaching of lead pipes into water supplies in [New
Orleans, LA](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/louisiana/articles/2017-07-20/new-orleans-official-warns-of-lead-threats-in-tap-water); as well as major copper and lead contamination of tap
water in [Flint,
Michigan](http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/07/flint_reports_on_water_quality.html).

Water Quality Standards Effective under the Clean Water Act (CWA) US EPA [https://www.epa.gov/wqs-tech/state-specific-water-quality-standards-effective-under-clean-water-act-cwa](https://www.epa.gov/wqs-tech/state-specific-water-quality-standards-effective-under-clean-water-act-cwa)
, leads to map of the United States, providing interactive state-specific water quality standards regulations, by
clicking on the State of interest; however, such information is no longer being updated by the EPA. Accordingly, readers
aware of recent changes in their state legislation, county/municipal ordinances
or court judgements within their own communities, with respect to water
quality, environmental sustainability and/or public health are urged to share
their contributions to the broader network, so as to build capacity for
collaboration, strengthened advocacy and development of a geospatial database
for environmental deregulation, and consequent vulnerable ecosystems and populations-at-risk.
