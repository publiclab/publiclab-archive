###What I want to do or know
I came across a lot of cameras for which are suitable to be converted into NDVI camera. But, technically i couldn't find any notes stating the requirements of camera suitable for filter replacement. So, Please suggest the list of features which a camera should incorporate for Filter replacement and NDVI imaging.
###Background story
I am planning to document the list of cameras suitable for Filter replacement. So, I would like to know the basic requirements of the cameras. Also, Please suggest me the features which a camera should not possess for Filter replacement.

Thanks Everyone.
