Hi I'd like to recreate your titraumatic system. 

The idea does seem interesting, and I was thinking of doing something with an arduino and a peristatic pump. But your idea seems very refined, since I would have start from screatch. But I would like to know which hardware you use to connect your pH probe to PC?

  
I have problem is that I am unable to run the GUI you created.

When run, all it does is freeze all applications (Windows 10) except mouse then I have to do a Ctrl+Alt+Del.
