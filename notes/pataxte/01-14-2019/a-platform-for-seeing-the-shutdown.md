Some university and nonprofit and community people in SoCal are discussing the idea of having a place where anyone could post images and very brief comments about what the US gvt shutdown is/looks and feels like to then and in their community. There are places where you can see ntl parks' fallout, or EPA lack of monitoring impact etc, or TSA, or other fed employees, or lack of critical social services etc, but how could we all share these beyond our own focus or discipline or group and compile the shared consequences?

  
But we're novices. Any suggestions about how and where this could be done would be much appreciated!
