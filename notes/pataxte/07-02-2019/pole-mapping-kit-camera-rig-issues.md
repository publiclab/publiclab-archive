For anyone working with the pole mapping kit - This kit was my xmas 
gift, finally getting to set up and use it. However, the mount is 
confusing. In the package it has a diagram of the mount, and says to see
this wiki page ([https://publiclab.org/notes/Natalie/03-06-2015/diy-pole-mapping-camera-mount](https://publiclab.org/notes/Natalie/03-06-2015/diy-pole-mapping-camera-mount))
for assembly instructions. In the included diagram the tripod mount 
comes out of the swiveling Ibeam clamp parallel to the pole. But above 
the set up has it coming out perpendicular to the pole. The latter makes
more sense, but none of the screws work for that set up, not enough 
room inside the clamp. But even if it did, the ball joint seems to work 
against you as well.

The challenge is that you want the camera to be horizontal, parallel 
to the earth, but since the tripod mount is on the bottom of the camera,
you need the mount to hold it perpendicular. And even if you can 
achieve that, because in my camera (Canon Powershot SD1000), and the one
in the pics on the wiki page, the tripod attachment hole is not in the 
middle of the camera, so the camera lists off to one side and does not 
remain parallel to the ground. It looks like the same is happening in 
the last pic on the wiki page as well.

I'm perplexed...Has anyone used the kit who could offer guidance? It's not self-evident to me.
Thanks for your help!
