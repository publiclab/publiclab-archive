We have a map in Mapknitter (https://mapknitter.org/maps/trinity-community-gardens-balloon-mapping-2019#) that I'd like to download as a jpeg. I'm not really clear about the difference bt download and export. When I use the download tab it says "no export formats available" unlike the tutorial that shows jpeg, pdf, TIFF and other formats as options. Also, I don't quite understand the warnings about exporting and auto replacement of previous exports - does this hold true if you don't move the previous export out of the download folder and so the 2nd export, with same file name will overwrite the 1st? What actually is the difference between export and download anyhow?

Thanks!
