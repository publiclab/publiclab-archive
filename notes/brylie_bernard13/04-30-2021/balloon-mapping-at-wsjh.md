Yesterday, my class and I did balloon mapping with the balloon mapping kit. The most interesting part was when we were letting the balloon up into the sky. I thought it was interesting because I was wondering how was it going up that high without popping. In all, this was a fun and interesting activity to do, and I hope that we can do something like it again. 

  
My classmates and I also build a microscope. Although building it took a little while, this was a fun and challenging activity.
