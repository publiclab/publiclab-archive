Can this [camera](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/2MP-1920X1080-100-Degree-No-distortion-Lens-Sony-IMX322-Color-CMOS-H-264-hd-mini-CCTV/32772961033.html)
 be suitable to make a spectrometer v3.0?

I've tried two old cameras 640x480.
But one of them was too noisy.
And I wasn't be able to stretch a spectrum for good calibration from the second camera.

Now, I decide to buy a new camera.
First, I want to avoid noises.
So, I want to get a camera with Sony IMX322 sensor instead of OV5640.

Second, I don't know what lens to prefer.
I want to get 100 degree no distortion lens.
I don't know, will it be possible to stretch the whole spectrum in this case? 

Am I wrong?
Thanks.
