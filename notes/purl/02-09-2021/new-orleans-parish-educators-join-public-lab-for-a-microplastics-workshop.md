Join us in New Orleans to learn about Community Science Programming on Microplastics for the classroom!

This workshop brings together high school educators from the New Orleans area to learn about our Messages from the Mississippi series, which is aimed to engage students in hands-on learning about microplastics in the Mississippi River. Participating educators will explore Public Lab's microplastics curriculum, and learn how to work with students to do field research, collect samples, learn about data analysis, and share their findings. Through this curricula, students will consider their roles as environmental stewards, explore advocacy pathways and social change tools to respond to the challenge of microplastics pollution. Highlights of this workshop:

- Build a Babylegs Aquatic Trawl
- Build Public Lab's Community Microscope
- Meet other local educators
- Interact with our [Messages from the Mississippi](https://publiclab.org/wiki/messages-from-the-mississippi-lesson-plans) curricula
- Connect with the Public Lab community and mission
