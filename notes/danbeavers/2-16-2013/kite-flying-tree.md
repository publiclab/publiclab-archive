That tree between the pines likes to fly kites.  I was a little upset with it because it was my kite.  The tree finally got bored after about 45 minutes and let go so I am not too upset.  It took me a couple of hours to find the kite but when I did there was absolutely no damage to it.  I love Tyvek!  The wind was very gusty and the line got snagged by the tree during an extended lull.
