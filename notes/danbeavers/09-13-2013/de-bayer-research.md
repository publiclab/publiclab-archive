##What I want to do
I got interested in how to remove the Bayer layer on image sensors.  Or how to convert a color camera into a monochrome camera by debayering it.

##My attempt and results
I did some web searching and found:
[JTW Astronomy](http://www.jtwastronomy.com/tutorials/debayer.html) - So far this is the most complete and reasonable instructions I have found.

Another site with lots of good technical information is [LDP LLC MaxMax.com](http://maxmax.com/IRCameraConversions.htm) but they don't have much information on how to do the conversion (that I have found so far).

##Questions and next steps
More research and experimentation.
