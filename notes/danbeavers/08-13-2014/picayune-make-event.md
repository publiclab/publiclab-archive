We invite you to join us August 16th, for a kickoff event of “Picayune Make.” With our mission to explore DIY electronics, we will be building a mini-lab for constructing complex circuit boards. This event will bring together community members with a passion for tinkering, students with an interest in electronics, and Public Lab researchers, in other words open source scientists, with a mission of exploring our environment and developing tools to accomplish that. This event will be held August 16th starting at 5:00 PM at the Kimono Dragon, 324 W. Canal St., Picayune. Light refreshments will be served.  See you at Picayune Make!
