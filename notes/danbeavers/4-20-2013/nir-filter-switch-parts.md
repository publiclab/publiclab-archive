##Parts
[Mathew](http://publiclab.org/profile/mathew) provided the filter switcher.  Both sides of the switch are covered with a protective film that I have not bothered to remove yet.  There are 5 separate parts.  All of the parts come out after removing the 4 screws (not shown).  The X shaped part is metal with internal threads for mounting the filter switch.  The other black material is plastic.  The solenoid is a split coil with magnet latching.  In other words the lever is held at one side or the other by a weak magnet.  You can easily change the filter with a hard shake in the appropriate direction.

##Filter

I closely inspected the filter holder to determine how the clear (Infra Red pass) filter was attached.  There were 4 spots of glue with 2 spots on 2 opposite edges.  I placed the glue side down on the paper towel which is over a hard surface and used the side of the forceps to gently press out the clear filter.  The removed filter is just visible above its holder.

##Questions and next steps
- What is the resistance of the coil? 19.7 ohm
- How to mount the visible filter?
- What to use for the IR pass filter?
- What are the dimensions of the new filter? 8.1 x 8.0 mm (probably square)
- How to mount the switch to my PowerShot A800?
- How to switch the filter? cheap H bridge
