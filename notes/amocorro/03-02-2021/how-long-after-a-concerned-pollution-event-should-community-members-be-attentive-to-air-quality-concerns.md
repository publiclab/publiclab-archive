Earlier in mid-February, a large fishing vessel caught fire and burned for over 24 hours in the Port of Tacoma. This created a black cloud of smoke and "shelter in place" advisory until the fire was fully contained by firefighting crews. The air quality advisory was removed within 1-2 days following the event...Though I'm curious, what could still linger or settle in the area that may be of a concern to the surrounding communities? I haven't been able to find any follow up information after the fire was put out.

From King5 News during the live event:
"_A boom is in place around the large vessel to contain any diesel, ammonia and fire retardant from spreading and polluting Puget Sound. Air quality was also a concern as plumes of smoke poured from the vessel for hours overnight..._"
