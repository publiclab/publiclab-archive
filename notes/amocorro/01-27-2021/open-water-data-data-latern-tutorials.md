**Sharing for water quality and organizing interested community members! Here's an activity that is replicable and can be done in your community.**

Learn more about the Open Water Data [project here](http://datalanterns.com/#about). Tutorials (including videos) to replicate your own data lanterns can be found here: [http://datalanterns.com/#tutorials](http://datalanterns.com/#tutorials).

Excerpt from website:

\_

"The Open Water Data project explores new ways to experience environmental data as a community to increase collective understanding and engagement in important civic conversations. It helps make open source governmental data visible, accessible, and useful to community members, advocacy groups, and local governments. It also turns a critical eye on how open data sets about the environment are shared with the public, and asks: Who do these datasets serve and who could they serve?

[Our team](http://datalanterns.com/#team) shares the [resources](http://datalanterns.com/#tutorials) for creating an Open Water Data installation so that other communities can hold similar events and help us all better understand environmental contamination. There are over 50,000 facilitities operating in the US with Clean Water Act (CWA) permits to emit wastes into public waterways."
