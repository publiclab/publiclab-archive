My local community (county level) doesn't currently have a [licensed waterkeeper entity](https://waterkeeper.org/), so I am trying to start some basic information collecting as a Washington State community member on where facilities of concern may be AND could be contributing plastic pollution in the Salish Sea --and more specifically in the [Puget Sound](https://www.eopugetsound.org/maps/puget-sound-watershed-boundary) and [South Puget Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Puget_Sound) including the [WRIA 10 Puyallup-White River Basin](https://www.eopugetsound.org/articles/water-resource-inventory-areas-puget-sound) and the City of Tacoma. Once I identify where these facilities of concern are, I hope to identify potential outfall areas. The waterkeeper website says my local chapter is based in Seattle...which doesn't serve the communities where I live (over an hour away).

I'm inspired by the following media and resources:
