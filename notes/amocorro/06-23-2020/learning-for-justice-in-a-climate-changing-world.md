Hello my name is Ashley. **I am the new Community Manager @ Public Lab.** I've spent the past 10+ days onboarding: reading about your projects, curiousities + calls for support, and the last decade of Community Science through a range of media shared on this website.

\_

_I've been reflecting a lot about the many pathways to justice and how these relate to our own collective wellness + the natural world in a climate changing world. How are youth and families learning about these topics: **advocacy**, **community environmental monitoring**, and [**just transitions**](https://climatejusticealliance.org/just-transition/)?_

I don't know if I ever stop thinking about these intersections. I'm always finding ways to ground my community organizing in cultures, health & wellbeing, and climate resilience. Lately I have been struggling to find words to encapsulate **_this moment_** in time. As I come to the greater Public Lab community in this new staff role and as a #newcomer, I'm also entering my fourth month during global pandemic. I have had a heavy heart as I see the continuation of a long list of hyperlocal-to-global concerns: [oil spills](https://amazonwatch.org/news/2020/0409-oil-spill-along-the-coca-and-napo-rivers-affects-ecuadorian-indigenous-communities), [deforestation](https://news.mongabay.com/2020/05/amazon-fires-may-be-worse-in-2020-as-deforestation-and-land-grabbing-spikes/), [increased food insecurities](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-04-24/COVID-19-Could-food-security-in-Southeast-Asia-be-in-jeopardy--PXsUnRCviE/index.html "https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-04-24/COVID-19-Could-food-security-in-Southeast-Asia-be-in-jeopardy--PXsUnRCviE/index.html"), [spikes in illegal fishing](https://news.mongabay.com/2020/06/lockdown-allowed-illegal-fishing-to-spike-in-philippines-satellite-data-suggest/ "https://news.mongabay.com/2020/06/lockdown-allowed-illegal-fishing-to-spike-in-philippines-satellite-data-suggest/"), lack of access to [clean and fresh water](https://blog.nativehope.org/water-warrior-from-the-navajo-nation), [communities falling ill](https://www.yakimaherald.com/special_projects/coronavirus/hispanic-businesses-doing-their-part-to-halt-coronavirus-spread-keep-people-safe/article_a8f9731a-3d07-5abe-8e44-ed52b3bd44d6.html) and publicized murder. Plus the disinvestment in grassroots-led initiatives across conservation, climate, and education...

Though despite the weight of it all, I am also feeling moved. I am seeing communities come together like never before (in my lifetime) and mobilize to support one another, especially on their journeys to justice. And I am feeling ignited by Public Lab's [Stategic Plan](https://publiclab.org/wiki/strategic-plan) 2020-2022 and how I will be able to amplify this work with the team at the start of this new decade.

_How do we hold one another accountable to these environmental injustices that are on-going in our/nearby communities during COVID-19? What is the condition or outcome that our/these communities are envisioning, and what are the associated actions? How do my actions contribute to the greater Climate Justice movement?_

I am still processing...

And I am looking forward to experiencing more of the collaborative processes Public Lab is known for at a future Barnraising (virtual or IRL!) and learning along side you in this ever-growing community.

Let me know what is moving you right now around Environmental Justice and Climate Justice. I look forward to connecting with you!
