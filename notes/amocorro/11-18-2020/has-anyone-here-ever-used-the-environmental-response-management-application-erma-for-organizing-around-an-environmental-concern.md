I'd love to hear how this database supported your community needs or fell short. Plus any best "how to use" tips you may have to share. I recently learned that NOAA adds Oil Spill data to this database for the Pacific Northwest Region, which is what sparked my curiosity.

About: [The Environmental Response Management Application (ERMA)](https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/resources/maps-and-spatial-data/environmental-response-management-application-erma) is an online mapping tool that integrates both static and real-time data, such as Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) maps, ship locations, weather, and ocean currents, in a centralized, easy-to-use format for environmental responders and decision makers.

##### ERMA is designed to:

- Visualize information relevant to spill preparedness and planning.
- Assist in coordinating emergency response efforts and situational awareness for human and natural disasters.
- Support the [Natural Resource Damage Assessment process](https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/environmental-restoration/natural-resource-damage-assessment.html).
- Aid in ecological recovery and restoration efforts.
