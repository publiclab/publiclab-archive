How have you threaded together local knowledge and histories where you are? There has been some discussion at Public Lab around the value of walking tours and community walks.

**I am wondering:**
*Have you ever created a toxic tour, environmental justice historical walking tour, or other informative community walks where you live? If so, how did you start?* 

**Perhaps you haven't created one...***Have you participated in one and/or experienced going on one? Where were you and what elements of the walk were striking to you?*  

If you have any to recommend (anywhere in the world), please share them in the replies below!
Appreciate any links to reference as well. Thank you!
