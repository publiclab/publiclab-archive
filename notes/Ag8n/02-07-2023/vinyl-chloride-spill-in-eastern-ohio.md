Came home to the TV news, tonight  There was a train derailment, that included four railcars carrying vinyl chloride.  This spill is in Eastern Ohio.  

  
Didn't work with vinyl chloride much.  But the polymerized form, polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, was a different matter.  It's everwhere.  Usually, you hope the level of vinyl chloride in PVC is low, because vinyl chloride ( or vinyl chloride monomer VCM in the industry) is toxic.  So seeing large amounts of raw vinyl chloride burned off sent shivers down my spine. What kind of clean up will be necessary at the spill site and in the air around the vinyl chloride spill?  Thank you!
