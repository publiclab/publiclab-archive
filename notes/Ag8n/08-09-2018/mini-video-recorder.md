Apogee rockets sells a u-838 video recorder ( currently out of stock) for about $100\.  This recorder weighs 0.67 oz , is about the size of a flash drive, and can record for up to 2 hours ( depending on battery and memory in it).  

  
It sounds like this might allow smaller kites, maybe the use of things like kite messengers, and give more flexibility overall to the program.  Which is probably too good to be true.  What are the problems with this device?

  
Thanks.
