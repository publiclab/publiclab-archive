Is there a reason why an aquarium type TDS ( Total Dissolved Solids ) meter couldn't be substituted for a conductivity meter?  

  
Granted, they are no where near as accurate as a conductivity meter. But...They are dirt cheap and they do indicate dissolved solids.

  
Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you.
