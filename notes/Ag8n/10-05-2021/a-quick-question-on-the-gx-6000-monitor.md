For measuring VOCs, the instrument has three different type of PID "heads" that can be used.  Which one is commonly used?  Also, the calibration standard suggested is with isobutylene.  Although there are many options.  Which standard is normally used?  The instrument is quite interesting, but it will take a bit longer to make it through the manual.
