Kite "messengers"are often used to carry toys ( like parachutes) to bear the top of a kite line.  There, they hit a line that released the flag that blew the messenger up the line ( and in the case of toys, released them), and returned the messenger to ground.  

  
Is there any potential use for this kind of devices for your kite projects?
