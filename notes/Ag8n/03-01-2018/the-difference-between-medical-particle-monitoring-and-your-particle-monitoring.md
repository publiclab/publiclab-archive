The particle monitoring done most frequently in a gmp factory is class 100000\.  This monitors 5 micron and 0.5 micron particles in the air and makes sure their level is relatively low.  Usually, this is done with an electronic particle monitor.  What is the difference between the medical situation and equipment and your situation and equipment?
