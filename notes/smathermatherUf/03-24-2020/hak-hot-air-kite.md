Hi All,

I am Stephen Mather, co-founder of the [OpenDroneMap ecosystem](http://opendronemap.org "http://opendronemap.org/") of tools and long-term benefactor of Public Lab's great foundational and ongoing work in citizen photogrammetry.

In addition to drones, I have a personal and professional interest in kites, balloons, and [kite balloon hybrids](https://publiclab.org/wiki/kite-balloon-hybrid) for photogrammetry. My friend and former colleague Dakota Benjamin has posted previously about our use of a helikites for mapping [here](https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=008366342703784425914:_p25pf-gy_w&q=https://publiclab.org/notes/dbenjamin/09-04-2015/photo-reconstruction-from-kap-at-acacia-reservation&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjsspGK77PoAhUkZjUKHY5dDr8QFjADegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw2aL-qCjAeS_0icJJsAfOVS) and [here](https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=008366342703784425914:_p25pf-gy_w&q=https://publiclab.org/notes/dbenjamin/09-18-2015/ir-photo-reconstruction-at-acacia-reservation&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjsspGK77PoAhUkZjUKHY5dDr8QFjABegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw0uIyqjA_CN9kve7wALFGgn).

Today, I want to introduce another friend of mine working on a kite balloon hybrid invention of his own:

> My name is Sam M. and I am a 5th grader working on a project for the Invention Convention Competition in June of 2020\. I have invented a Hot-Air Kite, and would like some feedback from the aerial photography community to make sure my idea will fit the needs of aerial photographers.

> The Hot Air Kite can be thought of as a non-helium version of the Helikite, a kite and hot air balloon combo. Helium is becoming a rare element, and is used in medicine, welding, and in missions to space, and it is becoming expensive. I made my project in an effort to preserve helium.

> 

> Would you please take 5 minutes to complete this survey? Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Sam M.
