Hi,
I am using this on my Sasmsung S5 phone and I find out my camera don't make good focus on photo so then picture of cpectrum is blur and not sharp so then I can't get good photo.
For example:

https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/78477

Is there any workaround to set focus manually so then photos would be sharp and I get better spectrum?
