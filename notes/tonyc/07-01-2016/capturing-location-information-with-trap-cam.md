# Capturing location information with trap cam

###What I want to do
Capture location information in a defensible way, using basic mobius camera configuration.

The basic idea is to approximate geotagging using the gear we have. 

I propose a method where, once the camera is installed in place, a GPS unit with LCD readout is held up to the camera so that the camera captures the information of location and satellite time. Then the camera runs its course from the same site. 

Additionally, a volunteer or multiple volunteers appear in front of the camera, and sign a statement testifying as to its location.

As an additional step, the camera could be set to shoot every 2 seconds, and record time lapse as the team drives it from a known landmark to the site, essentially providing a visual chain of custody. Example, if I were going to put this thing on the Columbia River, I might start a shot at a historical marker or lookout, then essentially film the entire drive out to the site, right up to the moment the camera is mounted in its real place. Then I could reset the camera setting to shoot at the longer interval, and start its real shot. But the first frame of the time lapse would be identical to the last frame of the drive-out shot.

I think these low-tech, low-cost methods could build a defensible case for position, if someone tried to say, "hey, that's not my mine. That could be anybody's mine..." or whatever they might try to say in a court.

Thoughts? I'd love to hear ideas or have someone poke holes in this methodology below.
