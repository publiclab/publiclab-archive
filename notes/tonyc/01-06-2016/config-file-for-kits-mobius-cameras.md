###Questions and next steps
Gather thoughts from folks who do this a lot. What do you think? What would you do differently if selling these to general population?

###Why I'm interested
Ready to start selling these cameras in the store, as standalone and as part of kite kits. Want to settle on the best way to make them functional as aerial rigs without requiring someone to edit a config file.
