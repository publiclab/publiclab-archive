###What I want to do
Right now the DSK version 3.0 requires a box, which means it has to go through customs and requires more expensive shipping options. The only parts that are not flat enough to ship in an envelope is the wooden block. My goal is to make  workable model using only paper and that packs down flat enough to fit into the USPS regulation envelope (11-1/2"x6-1/8"x1/4")

###My attempt and results
There are two approaches I've started on. One is a simple analogous replacement of the block. Basically, fold up a block and tape it down right to the bottom of the box. the platform is simply removed from the design. If velcro is required or desired, slap it right on the box. If movement/removal isn't needed, just tape the block right to the bottom of the box. The papercraft housing gains little rigidity from the platform, and IMHO, the platform is dead weight.

The other approach is pretty different, so I'll create a separate thread/note on it soon.

OK, so I mocked up a quick version of the block, giving it a bit more angular shape to increase strength.

###Questions and next steps
Next step is to create a flat file of the paper block and print it out to test. If it tests fine after refining, we can discuss whether this idea is worth creating a flat-pack variant Beta to ship, esp. to international customers.

Question is: does it work? How to make this design actually register at 45-degrees.
Also, need to design the piece to carry the diffusion grating DVD. But that's easy enough to do separately.

another question is whether or not htis is strong enough when made out of black card stock material, or whether additional reinforcement is required.

###Why I'm interested
This would make the fussiest kit easy to batch produce, ship for cheaper, and bring cost of production way down.
