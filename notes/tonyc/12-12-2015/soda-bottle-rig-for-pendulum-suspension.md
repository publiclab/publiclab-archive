###What I want to do

connect a point/shoot camera to the end of a dowel, protected for flight

###My attempt and results

this is a quick prototype of an idea to simplify the soda bottle rig. Original soda bottle rig has rubber bands passing through the neck of the bottle. My design goal was to make it easy to mount this rig to the end of a dowel, without introducting wear or friction on the bands.

The tension is provided against the screen, which presents an obvious problem. 
I found on this model at least, a protective card could be inserted to add impact protection, just a standard credit card size works.

###Questions and next steps
fly it, see if it works

Test it on someone else's camera to see if it breaks

###Why I'm interested
getting ready to introduce a pendulum kit in the kits store, and working to show good methods for use.
