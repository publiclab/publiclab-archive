###What I want to do
turn my mobius actioncam into a microscope

###My attempt and results
I pulled the 6mm lens, flipped it around, taped it to the CCD housing, closed it up, and suddenly, it was a microscope.

A paper sleeve allowed for crude focussing, via friction-fit.

A plastic piece, as a crude slide.

the result: Strictly OK.

###Questions and next steps

With better optics, different arrangements, hoping the CCD and the other features of the Mobius (possibly using a lens extension cable, etc) will allow for higher quality versions of traditional webcam microscopy projects already out there.

###Why I'm interested
Because there is a shmutzy mobius on my desk, and we've been talking about microscopy lately...had to try it!
