###create a method for deploying Riffle data logger inside of a soda bottle, using cheap materials and protecting against damage

###My attempt and results

Using 4 zip ties, created a square frame.

Then bound the Riffle board into the middle, leaving tails hanging off the two additional zip ties. The pressure is placed on the edge of the board, and the nature of zip ties gives you a bit of space on either side, without squishing any electronics.

The whole thing shoves into the bottle, then explands(tm) out to fill the available space. The Riffle is suspended at an angle, equidistant from the sides of the bottle. It's a bit hard to make out from just one photo. Gif forthcoming, I'm sure.
