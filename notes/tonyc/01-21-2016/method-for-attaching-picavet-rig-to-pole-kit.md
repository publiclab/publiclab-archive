###What I want to do

Easily and securely attach a picavet camera rig to the PL pole mapping kit.

###My attempt and results
Using the new addition of a rigid PVC pipe, I just scooched the mount down to the low end of this pipe, and attached one carabiner to the hardware by passing it through a screw hole. The other point clicks onto the pole, just above the rigid pipe, which by happy accident, is just the size to prevent it from slipping past.
