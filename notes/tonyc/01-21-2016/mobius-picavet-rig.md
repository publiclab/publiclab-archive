###What I want to do
Create a picavet configuration for the mobius actioncam, using readily available materials

###My attempt and results
So, I wouldn't publish this if the connection wasn't stronger than this looks. It's a happy accident that the dimensions of the mobius camera are perfect to shove into the maw of a wooden clothespin, just so the back edges fit the recess. This camera pops into place and is __locked in__.

Then I shove the ends into the PVC tubing. It is locked in place, but can be secured even more with a thumbtack.

I put a pilot hole in the PVC using an awl, then used a pair of scissors (or actually, one scissor...) to ream it out to allow a chopstick to pass through.

The rings are just binder clips, small enough to get a good bite even on the tapered ends. 

the whole thing looks rickety as heck, but each part of it is stronger than it looks. Additinal measures could be taken to provide failsafes, but I'd fly this thing, so thought I'd share it here.

###Questions and next steps
Fly one. Add minimal camera protection, especially around lens.
