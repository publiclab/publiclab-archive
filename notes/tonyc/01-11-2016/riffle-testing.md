###What I want to do
See if these dern things work.

###My attempt and results
We got 4 Riffles and 4 Coquis back from MacroFab today. We will now be testing these in Portland office to see if the manufacturing process is up to snuff. If they work, we will order enough for beta test of the Riffles. 

Mainly, I just want to say "WooHoo" and put some pictures on the wiki.

This is how they came to us.

here is an extreme-low-altitude map stitched together using Hugin.

###Questions and next steps
We are going to see if this thing turns on or not, and post progress as we go.
