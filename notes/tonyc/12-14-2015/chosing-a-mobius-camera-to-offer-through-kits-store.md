###What I want to do
I want to offer the right camera/lens combination through the kits store to support small form-factor aerial photography.

###My attempt and results
I purchased some unmodified Mobius cameras for inclusion in a soon-to-be-releases stuffable kite kit. I asked them to also include samples of 6mm and 8mm lenses, as well as one camera pre-rigged with each, based on research and notes by pcoyle

They arrived today.

You can see the IR filter tacked to the back of these:

Here is the view from my desk, through insulating plastic, BTW, taken with the Mobius with factory wide-angle lens.

Here is the same view, taken with 6mm lens:

Here is same view taken with 8mm lens:
[![8mm.JPG](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/336/medium/8mm.JPG)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/336/original/8mm.JPG)


Notice blue color shift on both images with modified lenses.


###Questions and next steps
Which of these is ideal for mapping applications? 

Would it make sense to offer the camera with stock lens, and then lenses for self-install, or would it be best to just have the right lens ship installed?

Next step would be to fly test flight with all three of these options clicking away, then post results, make decision based on that.

Then I would order stock to offer in the store.

For now, I can put these in store as options, and note it is experimental


###Why I'm interested
Want to make it easy for novice to get the "best" option based on our research, and have success on their first flights
