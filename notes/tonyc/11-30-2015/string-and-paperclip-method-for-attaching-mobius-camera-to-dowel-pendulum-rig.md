###Find a safe, no-cost and teachable method for attaching a Mobius Actioncam to a dowel

###The method:

[![P_20151130_140349.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/099/medium/P_20151130_140349.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/099/original/P_20151130_140349.jpg)

I started with a double "barrel hitch" knot, with the string ending in two overhand loops.

I took a keychain (could be a paperclip or whatever) and formed it into a horseshoe shape, with slight out-turn at the ends.

[![P_20151130_140541.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/100/medium/P_20151130_140541.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/100/original/P_20151130_140541.jpg)


I marked the dowel at approx crossing points, then nicked little slots with a knife.

Then I put the dowel in place,, and spun the horseshoe to cinch it all down.
Then I tucked the end of the horseshoe under the taught line to lock it in place (see main image).

The whole unit is just a rubber stopper, small-end-up, over the dowel and going into the neck of a 1/2 soda bottle. I left one end of twine long, so it could protrude through the neck, potentially clipping it to a carabiner as a safety should it slip off the dowel for some reason.



###Questions and next steps
What do you think? Is this too complicated? Is it actually worse than rubber bands, safety wise?

###I'm hoping to offer a complete kite aerial mapping kit and want to find a way to handle the connection between camera and rig that isn't rubber bands.
