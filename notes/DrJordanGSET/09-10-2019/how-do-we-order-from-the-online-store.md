We are an After School 21st Century Community Learning Center Program in Cranston RI.  We would like to order some of the learning materials, especially the Lego Spectrometer Kit.  Pleas send information to Ms. Sarah DeCosta, Director at sdecosta@cpsed.net.

  
Also send a follow-up to us about curricular materials to https://globalscienceandenvirotech.org
