I am a new Public Lab user and I am here to share my newest research 
endeavor: studying bees with a raspberry pi. I am conducting thesis 
research for my undergraduate studies, and like some of my peers, I want
to share my research with Public Lab users. I am studying sound 
production and activity patterns in Xylocopa virginica - the eastern 
carpenter bee. The plan thus far is to set up transducers and a camera 
outside of an eastern carpenter bee gallery. The transducers will record
sound coming from inside the gallery and the camera will record the 
gallery entrance. All of my data will be recorded with a raspberry pi. 
Ideally, if my data collection methodology works, then the gallery will 
be monitored long after I graduate, with the goals of describing the 
behavior of an understudied bee species. I am looking forward to sharing
my progress with all of you in the coming months.
