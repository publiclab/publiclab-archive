Hi,
Just wondering how it works (we wish to change the camera), does the software only expects raw data coming from the camera ? And what resolution does it require ? 
Also, what is the processing time for instance on the results? Can the software be run on linux?  

And a last question, is there an auto-calibration included with the software (in case camera settings are changed), and does it required to feed the camera a blue/green/red pattern, and then (something else to cover for most of spectrum)/ do you offer a calibration kit? And do the results expect a bayer pre-processing or is it independent?


Thanks a lot, and it really looks like a great project.
