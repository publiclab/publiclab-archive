Hi all,

I’m a Brooklyn-based artist, designer and researcher currently pursuing my masters at NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program (http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/).

I recently came across Public Lab’s project Home Testing for Endrocrine Disruptors (http://publiclab.org/wiki/environmental-estrogen-testing) and I was very excited to see an interdisciplinary group of people inspired by and working on this issue. Is the project still active?

I would love to be involved in some way. Also: I’m currently working on a wearable design project around testing water for estrogen and other endrocrine disruptors and would love to get feedback from the group. (The project is for a class taught by Marina Zurkow on the Anthropocene). 

Please let me know! Would love to connect with everyone.
