## Project description

PublicLab.Editor is a general purpose, modular JavaScript/Bootstrap UI library for rich text posting, which provides an author-friendly, minimal, mobile/desktop (fluid) interface for creating blog-like content, designed for [PublicLab.org](https://publiclab.org/ "https://publiclab.org/") (itself an [open source project](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2)).

PublicLab.Editor provides author-friendly interfaces for:

- titling
- main image uploading
- text body editing using [Woofmark](https://bevacqua.github.io/woofmark/ "https://bevacqua.github.io/woofmark/") (markdown/WYSIWYG)
- tagging
- edit [history.so](http://history.so) the **comment Editor overhaul project** has as a basic description: Take the public lab Editor, particularly the **comment Editor subsection** and examine, break into parts and repair broken pieces through bubfixes,refining and repairing, hence making it more readable,maintanable,reliable,compactible with other frameworks and hence adapting it to meet basic good coding practices.

### summary

i will like to be given the opportunity to work on the comment Editor so i can make it better , maintanable reliable and bug free. The Editor as a whole is a great initiative and i will like to see it flawless.

### 

### Problem

publiclabs is an outstanding idea with a very large codebase and even so many technologies and programming languages combined and so the comment editor is used in variants with shared code.hence complicating debugging by maybe fixes done on a section initiate an error or bug in another section. i am here to solve that in the best way possible.

### Timeline

Based on the interns task outlined here: \_[https://pad.publiclab.org/p/outreachy](https://pad.publiclab.org/p/outreachy "https://pad.publiclab.org/p/outreachy"), i will do everything in my power to follow this weekly agenda stated below perfectly unless or otherwise unforeseen circumstances,or adhear to any changes if my mentors think otherwise.

Week 1:

-Before the internship begins and one week into it, i will take out time to fix some things i noticed were not done using best coding practices on the Editor section like variable naming and linting .

-create first timers only issue and bug issues with respect to the bugs i will find due to the tests ran.

week 2:

-create first timers only issues and bugs issues with respect to the bugs i will find due to the tested ran.

-i will also fix some bugs my self.

Week 3:

-Remove template buttons to simplify code.

-Ensure recovery is consistently working.

-Make all comment Editors consistent among variants'.

Week 4:

-Write system tests to confirm basic functionality in comment, comment response, question comment, question comment response, editing all above types and editing/using all above types after having just posted them using AJAX.

-Explore comment types on the test server.

Week 5:

consolidate and organise test, so each type of test can be ran on each variant on the comment editor.

week 6:

-Organise code to simplify, reduce and ease maintenance.

-talk with my mentor on weather spinning the Editor out like other libraries make sense.

week 7

-work on image upload.

-already known issues include:

-Image upload doesn't begin on note comment #4617

-Display image in upload section #3558

week 8

-work on rich text entry.

known issues include:-Integrate new autocompletion code from PublicLab.Editor #4798,-Editor bottom-bar takes up a lot of space on mobile: let's compact it #4776

-non-unique id in comment form - possibly related to comment bugs #4771,

-Rich\_wiki new action #2542

Week 9:

-work on Save and Preview Text.

some issues already existing include:

-WIKI "Preview" state does not show a way to go back to editing #7112,

-Blurred value not saved sometimes #120,

-Issues with the search functions and lack of input sanitization #4943\.

week 10

-write test on image upload

-write test on rich text entry

-write test on save and preview text.

week 11

make first timers only issues and Bug issues on bugs found after running the test found while running the test.

Solve some bugs.

week 12

-Talk with my mentor so i can move to the authentication part of the application if accepted: run test and come up with first timers only issues and bug issues with respect to authentication.

issues on authentication include:

-Detect a login cookie and show Signup form unless a browser has logged in before? #6338

week 13

-solve issues i can handle.

suggest better practices to my mentor and if accepted i implemented them not from scratch though just make code more readable and accessible.

week 14

anything my mentor thinks i can do will be fine.

i cant wait to start this internship because from all this tasks i see a wonderful possibility to transform my life through learning and a massive contribution to a free and open project, even a better one which works in accordance to making the world a better place.

also i have been into Angular 7+ for 1 and a 1/2 years now both while i was still in school and during academic and professional internship seasons. so when i decided to join this community i started learning react As soon as [possible.so](http://possible.so) granting me this opportunity for internship and choosing the react implementation approach is what you don't want to miss.

Needs

Public Labs is made up of a great team and i will love if you all can give me a hand each time i need one so this internship can be a blast.

### First-time contribution

helping others is what i have grown to love and admire so i try my best to help people as often as possible. i never see someone needing help and and turn a blind eye to it. i try my best to always help my fellow open source first timers and contributors always even if it means doing a little more research when they need help.

below is a list to some of my contributions Ihave made to Publiclabs.

- Comments, to show overall community involvement (like helping others): [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/8325#issuecomment-716920999](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/8325#issuecomment-716920999 "https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/8325#issuecomment-716920999"),
- Open issues:[https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/7321#issuecomment-709514642](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/7321#issuecomment-709514642 "https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/7321#issuecomment-709514642")
- Closed PRs: my first timers only merged issue: [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8638#pullrequestreview-512875929](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8638#pullrequestreview-512875929 "https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8638#pullrequestreview-512875929"). I plan to do a whole lot more with everyones help.

### Teamwork

_I have been working on projects though private since 2years now, though i recently just graduated as a software engineer i have done lots of both academic and professional internships at prestigious companies._

_i have great communication skills with my first language been Enggish and i have worked with team members where we sometimes had to use one machine and do pair programming._

### Experience

_Javascript is my base language but i understand a couple of other languages as i have been experimenting alot. i have worked with Angular 7+ for 1 and 1/2 year and when i saw this project and how welcoming everyone at the publiclab were i decided to start learning react which i am already getting a hand on it since is isnt very different from Angular._

_RubyonRails is pretty new to me but i have started learning it already and catching up isn't going to a whole lot of struggle._

_i have used the following :_

_HTML_

_CSS_

_Python(flask)_

_Javascript (Angular 7+, react)_

_Wordpress_

_RubyOnRails._

_Git(version control)_

\_github link for reference: \_[https://github.com/tawahpeggy?tab=repositories](https://github.com/tawahpeggy?tab=repositories)

### Motivation

_I love programming above all helping other succeed._

_**I draw my strength from the marginalization i and other females receive in my community as women in technology. i really want to do something about always been looked down on as not been able to bring something tangible to the world of technology as a female.**_

### Audience

_my plan is to satisfy all public lab users especially those using the Editors for a better experience and to continue the trend which is making public labs a place like home for all its users and contributors._

### Commitment

_I actually understand that this internship is a serious commitment and i have cleared out all my activities for the time frame and will be committed to contributing to this project from now till the end of the internship and beyond._
