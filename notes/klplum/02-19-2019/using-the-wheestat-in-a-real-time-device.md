My group has assembled the Wheestat, but we are looking to build it as a real time device. If we attach the potentiostat to a wifi sensor and give it a power source will that be enough to have it run the data as an IOT device, or will it need a more in depth set up. We have also looking into linking it to an arduino but will that just do the same thing as the initial micro controller?
