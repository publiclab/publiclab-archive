### There is problem with spam questions that cause real questions to take long time to be approved. Could someone look into possibility of moderation of questions with machine learning algorithms? Most clear spam could be deleted straight away and not so clear could be left to moderators.  

This would solve problem of slow approval time. Ideally it would be 1 hour.

> I expected to get approval same day but I had to ask same question in chat next day and then someone was very helpful and did moderation of my question.
