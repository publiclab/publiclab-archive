Reason I want to do this is so that I can measure plants uptake of 
different nutrients and add right nutrients to reservoir with automated 
nutrient dispenser. Plants I want to study are salad, tomato, chili 
peppers, cucumber and strawberry. Maybe I will grow some other food 
plants later but these are what I would start with.  

  
Is it possible to use spectrometer for 
analysis of nutrient concentration in solution? I want to measure as many different nutrients as possible. If it is possible could someone link me some literature about using spectrometer for nutrient concentration analysis?   

  
I am open to other analytical methods to measure nutrient 
uptake if anyone knows better ones. I think ion selective electrodes with artificial neural network would be quite cool for analysis of nutrient solution but it seems to be too expensive for me as single electrode is multiple hundred €. I am looking something hobbyist can buy or build with max ~1000€.  

  
Thank you.
