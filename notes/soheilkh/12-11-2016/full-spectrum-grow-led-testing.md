###What I want to do or know
I'm testing a "Full Spectrum" grow LED with way more red LEDs than blue but I get a very strong blue which is stronger than red. I'm trying to find out why am I having this problem. 

###Background story
I'm using a customized spectrometer I made from scratch which is very similar to the "Desktop Spectrometry Kit" as for the housing and angles and grating (DVD). The camera I'm using is Microsoft LifeCam Cinema 720p Web Camera as my camera. I taped the DVD grating to the front of the camera. To clean the DVD I used dishwasher soap to clean the residue of the DVD blue hue. I calibrated my spectrometer with  CFL light which seems to be accurate.  

I used a white A4 paper that I put on top of the slit to overcome the overcompensation of the strong LED even without it the blue seems stronger. Any one know why or how can I  

The LED has 240 epileds in total with the following colors: 
Red 168pcs,
Blue 48pcs
White 16pcs
UV4pcs
IR4pcs
