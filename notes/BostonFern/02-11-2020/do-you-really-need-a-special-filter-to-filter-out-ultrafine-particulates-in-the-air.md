I know there are manufacturers that make air purifier that can filter out particulaters smaller than 0.3 um, which is what HEPA filter can filter.   But, according to this webpage [https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/can-hepa-filters-capture-nanoparticles/](https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/can-hepa-filters-capture-nanoparticles/ "https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/can-hepa-filters-capture-nanoparticles/"),  a normal HEPA filter should be able to capture particulates of any size, including the ones smaller than 0.3 um.   

  
Their reasoning is that ultrafine particulates move in a zigzag way and can get easily stuck somewhere, and the particulates that are most difficult to filter out is 0.3 um, which HEPA can filter. 

  
What do you think?
