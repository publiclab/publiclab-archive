Hi there,
I'm interested in building one of these for use in my homebrewery, but I have found that many of the links seem to be broken (the one to the pdf of the cardboard insert, and the old instruction manual, for instance). I'm also a little unsure about dimensions, as nothing seems to have a measurement attached to it other than the focal length of the webcam for the grey box camera desktop version. It says 9 inches, in order to focus on the slit, yet the slit (based on my estimation) is much less than 9 inches distant from the webcam. I can't tell, however, whether I'm missing some element of the optics, or whether my estimate is just terrible. 

I guess, in short, I was wondering if someone could make accessible a clear and concise list of critical dimensions, and fixx the broken links.

Thanks,
Frazer.
