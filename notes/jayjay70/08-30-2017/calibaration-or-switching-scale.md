How could I calibrate this Spectrum so that the peaks now between 100-250 would be in 300-350?

This Spectrum is from Trixie UVB light and the wavelength should start to rise just after 300 and go down at 375.

The shape is quite decent compared to lamp reference picture, but scale is all wrong.

Can you please help?
