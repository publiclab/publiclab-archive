##**Program**<br>
**Futures Beyond Refining**, Dr. Bethany Wiggin<br>
This talk examines a community-based participatory action research project based in south Philadelphia, site of what was, until 2019, the largest and oldest petroleum refinery on the east coast. This talk documents research outcomes, explores arts-driven methods, and considers how research partnerships can effectively work to repair relations and bring about more just energy futures.

**Lichens CitiSci**, Hanna Mesraty<br>
Lichens CitiSci is a community science project that engages publics around critical issues impacting public lands using lichens as air quality biomonitors. We focus on lichens, the eye-catching bioindicator, to create relatable connections between impacts on our air and why air quality matters. 

**Pb (Prospering backyards)**, Maru Garcia<br>
Pb is a project that uses the power of art, science, and community to address the severe case of lead contamination in the soil caused by Exide Technologies in areas of East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights, Vernon, Commerce, Maywood, Huntington Park, and Bell.
