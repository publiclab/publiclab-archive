Hello Public Lab world! I'm Vania Fong and I'm this year's Air Research Curation Fellow, and I'm based in San Francisco, California.

  
In my day-to-day I do data analytics to support clean energy programs, and I'm particularly interested in how technical analyses can be integrated with storytelling and the human element to address environmental justice issues and empower communities.  I had been a part of Engineers for a Sustainable World for a few years so I'm super excited to be able to continue doing science-based and community-grounded work. Outside of Public Lab and my job, I enjoy listening to philosophy podcasts and practicing photography (alliteration not intended :smiley: )

  
Here's a photo of me with our family dog, Susie, at my hometown in Southern California. Pardon the pixelated quality--this was shot on our family's security camera mounted near the roof. Honored to be here with such a passionate community and looking forward to meeting more of you during the fellowship!
