Often, the pollutants that get into our air, water, and soil are invisible and "out of sight, out of mind".  Even with a network of sensors and real-time graphs showing air quality, people often don't intuitively know what a certain number feels like. What are creative ways to help people not just visualize, but contextualize what environmental measurements mean and make data tangible?

A couple I've heard of include Michael Pinsky's [Pollution Pods][1], immersive pods that simulate air quality of the most polluted cities, [New York Times Pollution Augmented Reality app][2], which uses floating particles to indicate levels of pollution, and Andrea Polli's [Particle Falls][3], a public art installation that also serves as a real-time visualization of particulate matter. The California Air Resources Board is commissioning a [public art collection][4] that will be the worldâ€™s largest permanent collection of artworks addressing air quality and the effects of climate change.
