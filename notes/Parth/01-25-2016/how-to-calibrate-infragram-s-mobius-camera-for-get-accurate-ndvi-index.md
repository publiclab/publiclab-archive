Hello,

I have purchased infragram plant camera for find NDVI index of plant. I share camera's information link for your reference.
http://store.publiclab.org/collections/diy-infrared-photography/products/infragram-point-shoot-plant-cam

I captured various plant images using these camera for finding NDVI Index.I converted these captured images into NDVI images using infragram's python scripts,fiji software utilities and infragram 's on-line web server utilities,But I could not get accurate NDVI index for plant.

I share captured image and NDVI image for your information.

captured image of infragram 's plant camera (original image)

 python script converted NDVI image

Infragram's on-line web server converted NDVI image.

I shared the below NDVI conversion utilities 's links for your reference.
https://github.com/p-v-o-s/infrapix
http://infragram.org/sandbox/legacy/
  
I am also get the different different NDVI index of same image using different different NDVI conversion utilities.

I found some suggestion like calibrate the camera on public lab's forum discussion .
But my queries are,
1)How to calibrate infragram plant camera ?
2)why i get different different NDVI index of same image ?  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
