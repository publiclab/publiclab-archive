I am going to be working on wetlands / bog environments looking for changes in plant health.

I am about to convert a Canon 16Mp camera with one of the Infragram filters (having ordered the red & blue set).

Does anyone know the current state of thinking in terms of preference for the red or blue filters? Are there any recent published papers where the data has been collected with this type of red filter in a converted consumer camera?

Cheers,  
Steve
