I'm working with a raspberry pi. I am planning to use a raspberry pi camera that is already connected with the raspberry pi to use it to detect the health of the crops. Is there a phyton code, or how can I make that the raspberry pi camera can detect the crops and their wealth without having to use the website. I mean is there any way in which I can make the camera just with the filters process the crops and immediately produce the results to a computer or to other device?
