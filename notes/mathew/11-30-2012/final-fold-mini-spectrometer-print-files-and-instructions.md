# Final fold-up mini-spectrometer print files and instructions

Attached below are the final print and cut files, and  pictures of the big stacks of spectrometers that arrived on my porch.  With these files, you too can make 2000 spectrometers.  For those who just want one, see the 1-page directions, now with a second page with laser-cutting vectors.

I changed the directions around breaking DVDs into diffraction gratings after breaking up a big stack of them. The best way to get a clean diffraction grating is to. separate a quarter of the DVD and then snip a bit out.  The previous directions suggested snipping, then separating, which was only effective about 80% of the time, and produced more aberrations in the grating.

snip then separate the diffraction grating:
