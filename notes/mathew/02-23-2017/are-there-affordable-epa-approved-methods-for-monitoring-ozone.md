I got an e-mail asking if I knew any EPA-approved low-cost methods for monitoring ozone. I don't, but I figured it wouldn't be too hard to find the list of Federal Equivalent Methods (FEM) and Federal Reference Methods (FRM).  I was wrong. 

I found a place where the EPA says they should have a [list of FEMs and FRMs](https://www3.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/criteria/reference-equivalent-methods-list.pdf), but the file is missing.  I filed an error report.

Does anyone know where to get the FEMs and FRM list? Am I just looking in the wrong spots? Is the list missing because its being updated to meet the 2015 change in FRMs for ozone?
