###What I want to do
Find a cheap polycarbonate or polyester film filter made by [Rosco](http://www.rosco.com/filters/roscolux.cfm) that can replace the more expensive and less durable [Kodak Wratten 25A gelatin filter](http://motion.kodak.com/motion/Products/Lab_And_Post_Production/Kodak_filters/wrattten2.htm)

###My attempt and results
I downloaded [Kodak's absorption graph](http://motion.kodak.com/motion/uploadedfiles/Kodak/motion/Products/Lab_And_Post_Production/Kodak_Filters/W2-25.pdf), and wanted to compare it to Rosco's transmission graphs, so I flipped it upside down:

Its distinguishing features are that it begins to pass light above 580nm and somewhat below 380nm.  with that in mind, I found these Rosco filters: 

#### Roscolux #19 Fire

Originally suggested by Chris Fastie as pretty darned close.

#### Roscolux #25 Orange Red

#### Roscolux #26 Light Red

###Questions and next steps
Beyond the transmission curve, there is another factor, the % transmission, which determines how saturated with dye the filter is.  The existing Infragram filter, Rosco 2007, has 10% transmission. I'm not sure the exact transmission of the Wratten, although I found [this chart:](http://www.karmalimbo.com/aro/pics/filters/transmision%20of%20wratten%20filters.pdf)

[![Screen_Shot_2014-04-28_at_5.52.38_PM.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/003/911/medium/Screen_Shot_2014-04-28_at_5.52.38_PM.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/003/911/original/Screen_Shot_2014-04-28_at_5.52.38_PM.png)

 While the curve of #19 is very close to the Wratten, the total transmission is 20%, twice the #2007.  That makes me lean towards the #26, which has 12% transmission.  We'll have to prove it in the field.

I have to mount in my camera and go shooting with these. I printed [Chris Fastie's filter mount:](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-18-2014/mobius-filter-o-matic)
