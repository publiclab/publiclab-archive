## What procedure is best to determine background airborne silica levels?

We are looking to deploy [MiniVol](/wiki/minivol) [filter-based PM samplers](/wiki/filter-pm) to determine the background particulate matter levels in air, particularly for [silica emissions](/wiki/silica-monitoring) around [frac sand mines](/wiki/frac-sand).

A major community question has been, _"what percentage of airborne PM is from the mines or dangerous crystalline silica?_

While [several Wisoconsin mines have PM monitors active](/wiki/nonmetallicmining#Regulation+and+Monitoring+of+Sand+mining), all are performing gravimetric analysis to determine total airborne PM and using EPA [assumptions of 10% silica](/wiki/pm-monitoring-regulations#Silica). 

Both industry and community-collected PM measurements would benefit from a better understanding of the relative mixture of silica and other PM sources in background air quality. 

## Potential tests
24-hour samples with the MiniVol can be subjected to several different lab methods to determine silica content of PM. Three [different lab methods are available for the Minivol](/wiki/minivol#What+kinds+of+monitoring+can+the+MiniVol+do?) that can look at silica content. These are the same cost regardless of whether PM2.5, PM10, or PM4 are measured:

Analysis Method|Analysis target|cost|notes
----|----|----|----
Gravimetric analysis, [NIOSH 0500](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-154/pdfs/0500.pdf)| Total mass of PM |$20-25|essential first step before other tests
X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF)|total silicon|$30| elemental silicon, not silica or crystalline silica specifically
X-Ray Spectroscopy (XRD)| Quartz only|$65|
X-Ray Spectroscopy (XRD)| Quartz & Cristobalite|$75|
X-Ray Spectroscopy (XRD) [NIOSH 7500](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-154/pdfs/7500.pdf)|Cristobalite and Tridymite |$85|


## Sampling frequency/quantity?
How many 24-hour sampling periods are needed to say something meaningful about background silica levels?

This question can be divided into two questions, I believe.

1. what meets Federal Reference Method requirements?
2. what is statistically significant?
