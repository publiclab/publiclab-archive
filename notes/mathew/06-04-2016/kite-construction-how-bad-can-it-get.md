###What I want to do
I'm interested in workshopping [Stormy Weathers' Horned Allison Sled Kite.](/tag/horned-allison) ([plans pdf](http://www.drachen.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Weather%20Book%207-11-11.pdf)), and I wanted to see how poor the construction could be and still have a flying kite. 

###My attempt and results
I started from a pre-cut pattern in Tyvek (this part was precise, I think I'd pre-cut the patterns in a workshop), and then taped down the McDonalds' straw spars recommended in the plan with 1" masking tape.  I stuffed three straws into each other, end to end, and I lined them up by eye and taped them down.  It was very messy and I didn't fold in any reference marks or anything:

I similarly applied the 1/4" PP strapping tape (brand: Tesa 4288) for the bridle attachments entirely by eye. They are slightly uneven.

Then I tied the bridle.  Here I made sure the bridle point was in the exact middle. 

###In Flight
I flew this kite and it flew great.  I haven't gotten a good in-flight photo yet.  I was suitably impressed, and it flew better than the version I made [very carefully with bamboo spars](https://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/05-02-2016/stormy-o-weathers-horned-allison-towards-a-kite-wind-speed-meter). 

###Questions and next steps

My goal is to use this kite as a [wind speed meter](/tag/wind-speed-meter) and need to [calibrate it](https://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/5-11-2012/using-kites-atmospheric-wind-speed-meters).
I need to get a better clinometer and spring scale setup.  My current spring scale is 5000g, @Ecta64 is recommending 250g scale. I should really attach the clinometer to a tripod or other leveling system.

I also need to replace the stretchy dacron line with a non-stretch line, as recommended for a kite anemometer (wind speed meter). I bought 3000' of [70lb kevlar line from Emmakites](http://www.emmakites.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=336_365&products_id=153&zenid=e14na7pmk0klm9jks7l1nqdjc5).

I want to see if I get the same high-wind spar failures that @Ecta64 is [reporting.](https://publiclab.org/notes/Ecta64/11-01-2016/high-wind-range-tailless-sled-kite-design)

I should try a version out of a plastic bag, not just my fancy type 10 Tyvek.
