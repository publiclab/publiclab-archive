###Analysis Prep
In analyzing passive particle monitors, we’ll collect a glass slide cover with a 6mm circle of dust that has settled over 1-10 days in a [passive particle monitor](http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/09-02-2015/replicating-a-passive-dust-monitor-method) we've [imaged](http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/09-03-2015/optical-imaging-of-passive-particle-monitors).

[![glass slide with a dot drawn on it](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/458/medium/Screen_Shot_2015-09-03_at_5.21.06_PM.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/458/original/Screen_Shot_2015-09-03_at_5.21.06_PM.png)

We’ll take a survey of 40 images ([see note on imaging](http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/09-03-2015/optical-imaging-of-passive-particle-monitors)) of the glass slide cover at 100x:

[![forty different sample squares](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/459/medium/Screen_Shot_2015-09-02_at_7.45.29_PM.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/459/original/Screen_Shot_2015-09-02_at_7.45.29_PM.png)

We’ll then process the images in full-contrast black and white and fill any “holes” in the image so that the image can be processed more easily. We’ll use ImageJ, which may have standard functions for contrast if not hole filling, though Ott and Peters used it to do that.

Each individual particle will be sized as if it was a circle of the same area (projected area diameter) as the as the particle's outline (the projected area) and measured for circularity. Circularity is a ratio of the area to perimeter: 1 / (4π gravity x Area / Perimeter^2) Again, we’ll use ImageJ, which should have standard functions for this.

At this stage we’ll know:

* number of images x image area = survey area 
* number of  PM2.5 & of PM10 -sized particles on the survey area
* time the monitor was exposed.

 we want to figure out what the average mass concentration of dust was in the air over the sample period, in a micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m^3) equivalent. 

We’ll be following the mass concentration analysis used in on field samples in Ott et al.  I’ve tried to collect a procedure, for a deeper explanation please read the paper:

I’ve used annotation that is more “pseudocode” than math annotations in text, and then drawn the symbolic math by hand because I don't know how to do math annotation on a computer (this research note probably accepts [LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) syntax but i don't know it)
###Calculating Individual Particle Mass

the mass of the particle is a volume times particle density, corrected for the relative circularity of the particle:

Mass = (π/6) x particleDensity x (projectedDiameter / ParticleCircularity)^3

[![Untitled-6.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/466/medium/Untitled-6.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/466/original/Untitled-6.jpg)

particle circularity is: 1 / (4π gravity x Area / Perimeter^2) 

We know the projected-area diameter and circularity of each particle, and we can assume, as Ott et al. and Wagner & Macher 2003 did, that dust is 2g/m^-3.  

They assume this number because particle density has a smaller effect on the results than other factors and is hard to know over a varied sample period.  We can pick a different concentration from the literature or based on test results of background dust characteristics from a filter-based assessment (more on page 157, Ott et al.). 

###Calculating a particle’s contribution to the mass concentration

The Contribution of the particle is the mass flux of the particle divided by its deposition value

Contribution = massFlux / depositionValue

[![Untitled-1.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/463/medium/Untitled-1.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/463/original/Untitled-1.jpg)

unpacking this (explained below) into one equation, we get

Contribution = [Mass / (sampleArea x Time)] / [ [[(particleDensity x projectedDiameter^2) / (18 x dynamicViscosity)] x g] x .00595 x [[projectedDiameter x [(particleDensity x projectedDiameter^2) / (18 x dynamicViscosity)]g] / kinematicViscosity]^-0.439 ]

[![contribution.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/464/medium/contribution.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/464/original/contribution.jpg)

**I could use help understanding what the kinematicViscosity or dynamicViscosity are, all other numbers accounted for**

####Mass Flux of the Particle

I don’t really know what mass flux means but its the mass of a particle divided by the total sample area times the total sample time:

massFlux = Mass / sampleArea x Time

[![Untitled-2.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/465/medium/Untitled-2.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/465/original/Untitled-2.png)

####Deposition Value of a Particle
The deposition value of particle is the ambient deposition value multiplied by an empirical “mesh factor” derived in a wind tunnel data in Wagner and Leith Pt. II.

depositionValue = depositionAmbient x meshFactor

[![Untitled-2-2.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/467/medium/Untitled-2-2.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/467/original/Untitled-2-2.png)

#####Ambient Deposition factor
Ott et al. ’s deposition factor is the “relaxation time of the particle” multiplied by gravitational constant.

depositionAmbient = relaxationTime x gravity

[![Untitled-4.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/468/medium/Untitled-4.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/468/original/Untitled-4.jpg)

relaxationTime = (particleDensity x projectedDiameter^2) / (18 x dynamicViscosity)

[![Untitled-5.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/469/medium/Untitled-5.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/469/original/Untitled-5.jpg)

#####Mesh Factor
the mesh factor is a “best fit” line for emipirical data.  It depends on the relaxation time like the ambient deposition factor, and something called kinematic viscosity of air:

.00595 [(projectedDiameter x relaxationTime x gravity) / kinematicViscosity)^-0.439

[![Untitled-3.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/470/medium/Untitled-3.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/470/original/Untitled-3.jpg)

> Both of these factors are dependent on a physics concepts left unexplained in the literature that I’m stuck on, but assume are easily calculatable but temperature dependent: the dynamic and kinematic viscosity of air.
_see Ott, Cyrs & Peters 2008 page 159._

Can I just plug in numbers for dynamic and kinematic viscosity from [a table of values like this one](http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/dry-air-properties-d_973.html)? 

###Calculating the Average Mass Concentration

The average mass concentration is discrete integral of the individual particle’s contribution to mass concentration, multiplied by a curve for respirable PM10 and PM2.5 following [Hinds 1999](ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Documents/OEL/02.%20Kuempel/References/Hinds_1999-Aerosol%20technology.pdf) page 255:

[![pm10.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/471/medium/pm10.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/471/original/pm10.jpg)

**Values of Ei** |  
--------------------|---------------------
E = 0.9585—(0.00408 x projectedDiameter^2) | for projectedDiameter <15μm 
E = 0 | for projectedDiameter > 15μm 

**E for PM 2.5:**

PF2. 5 = [1 + exp((3.233 x projectedDiameter) - 9.495)^-3.368
