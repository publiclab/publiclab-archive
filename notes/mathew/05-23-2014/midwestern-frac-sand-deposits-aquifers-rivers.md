###What I want to do
I want to understand where frac sand is being mined and why.  I started from the Iowa Policy Project Project document [Digging Deeper on Frac Sand Mining](http://www.iowapolicyproject.org/2014docs/140130-fracsand.pdf) because I was intrigued by this map I found in there from the Iowa Geologic Survey:

It looked like the exposed sandstone follows river valleys.  which makes sense, they're major points of erosion. 

The same pattern is visible in Minnesota.

###My attempt and results
Through the [US Geological Survey's Groundwater Atlas](http://pubs.usgs.gov/ha/ha730/ch_j/J-Cambrian.html), I discovered is that the Upper Midwest contains a large sandstone aquifer made up of interlinked sandstone deposits from the Cambrian & Ordivician periods, and appropriately called the Cambrian-Ordivician Aquifer System. The aquifer is especially permeable because the limestone is made of fine, well-ground sand.  These same properties make the sand valuable as frac sand. 

The deposits are known as the St. Peter, Jordan, and Wonewoc deposits, visible in this USGS Map:

Wisconsin Watch's map shows that the upper edge of the Cambrian-Ordivician is being mined heavily:

###Questions and next steps
I want to share a few notes from the same 
Iowa Policy Project Project's [Digging Deeper on Frac Sand Mining](http://www.iowapolicyproject.org/2014docs/140130-fracsand.pdf)

The bluffs are near streams, these streams are the bedrock of the local trout fishing tourist industry.

The Wisconsin DNR has sent noncompliance letters to 80-90% of mines they have visited.

"the entire area where sand might be mined is underlain by permeable rocks with only a few remnants of glacial material atop them, so the groundwater is very vulnerable to contamination."
--Iowa State Geologist Bob Libra

A closed-loop (water recycling) industrial frac sand facility operating will require well capacity ranging from 700 to1380 gallons per minute, and an open loop system will require 2000-3700gpm.

Large water withdrawals may have regional effects, such as those used to wash sand. 

Ironically, water recycling uses polyacrylamide as a settling agent, and it breaks down into acrylamide, a "probably carcinogenic" chemical, according to the EPA.
