###What I want to do
Discuss a method for mapping the variability of airborne dust across the landscape.  I'm going to summarize the use of [passive PM monitors](/wiki/sem-stub-pm) and [optical PM monitors](/wiki/optical-pm) outlined in:

**Passive sampling to capture spatial variability in PM10–2.5**
Darrin K. Ott, Thomas M. Peters, and Naresh Kumar
Atmospheric Environment 42 (2008) 746–756

###My attempt and results
Ott et al. toured Iowa city taking 6-minute samples with their optical particle counter at over 60 sites over four days in order to create a preliminary map of suspected hotspots.  Most spots were visited at least twice:

They used an analysis of this data to identified the number of passive PM monitors needed and the locations for long-term sampling.  passive PM monitors were deployed for three 7-day samples per site.

The data was suggestive that a rock quarry was the most consistent source of course particles across seasons, while the roadway, a suspected route of exposure, didn't show elevated levels. 

###Questions and next steps
This methodology is potentially replicable.  


###Why I'm interested
