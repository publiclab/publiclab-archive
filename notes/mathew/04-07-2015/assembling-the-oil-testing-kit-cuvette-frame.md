This cuvette frame's [design notes are here, along with previous versions and other design ideas](http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/04-07-2015/designing-an-oil-testing-kit-cuvette-frame).  It can be used with [this procedure](/notes/mathew/09-19-2014/grading-oils-with-uv-fluorescence)

Download and cut out all the five pieces:

I recommend a card stock like a cereal box. lines can be scored with hard presses of a pen, butter knife, or other smooth blunt thing.

Start with the main frame piece and pre-crease the folds:

[![IMG_20150406_170830.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/592/medium/IMG_20150406_170830.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/592/original/IMG_20150406_170830.jpg)
[![IMG_20150406_170943.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/593/medium/IMG_20150406_170943.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/593/original/IMG_20150406_170943.jpg)

Slide the long tab through the opposite side wall, and then tuck in place:

[![IMG_20150406_171018.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/594/medium/IMG_20150406_171018.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/594/original/IMG_20150406_171018.jpg)
[![IMG_20150406_171129.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/595/medium/IMG_20150406_171129.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/595/original/IMG_20150406_171129.jpg)

The long strip with triangular holes should be folded up like this: 

[![IMG_20150406_171148.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/596/medium/IMG_20150406_171148.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/596/original/IMG_20150406_171148.jpg)
[![IMG_20150406_171238.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/597/medium/IMG_20150406_171238.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/597/original/IMG_20150406_171238.jpg)

Don't completely fold up this little part, just fold along the length-wise fold:

[![IMG_20150406_171305.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/600/medium/IMG_20150406_171305.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/600/original/IMG_20150406_171305.jpg)
[![IMG_20150406_171328.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/601/medium/IMG_20150406_171328.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/601/original/IMG_20150406_171328.jpg)

put it together by putting the M-folded sheet into the box, and sliding the V-folded strip through the center.  Make sure the matching rectangular cuts are on the correct side, so that we can slide the laser attenuator in place.

[![IMG_20150406_171458.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/602/medium/IMG_20150406_171458.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/602/original/IMG_20150406_171458.jpg)

[![IMG_20150406_171630.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/603/medium/IMG_20150406_171630.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/603/original/IMG_20150406_171630.jpg)
That rectangular cut in the V-folded strip can get caught on the last little push through.  watch it.

The last centi meter is the hardest to get through.

[![IMG_20150406_172022.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/604/medium/IMG_20150406_172022.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/604/original/IMG_20150406_172022.jpg)

once through, push the tabs in place on both sides:

[![IMG_20150406_172650.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/606/medium/IMG_20150406_172650.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/606/original/IMG_20150406_172650.jpg)
[![IMG_20150406_172626.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/605/medium/IMG_20150406_172626.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/605/original/IMG_20150406_172626.jpg)

Alright, the frame is almost done!  Now to put the cuvette holder in place.

[![IMG_20150406_172819.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/607/medium/IMG_20150406_172819.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/607/original/IMG_20150406_172819.jpg)

Pre-fold the cuvette holder:

[![IMG_20150407_140244.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/608/medium/IMG_20150407_140244.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/608/original/IMG_20150407_140244.jpg)
[![IMG_20150406_185914.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/609/medium/IMG_20150406_185914.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/609/original/IMG_20150406_185914.jpg)
[![IMG_20150406_185925.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/610/medium/IMG_20150406_185925.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/610/original/IMG_20150406_185925.jpg)

This fold is the trickiest. Push inwards on the center section while folding. It will pop in place.  Crease all the way flat: 

[![IMG_20150406_185624.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/613/medium/IMG_20150406_185624.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/613/original/IMG_20150406_185624.jpg)

Now lets put it in the frame:

[![IMG_20150406_185956.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/614/medium/IMG_20150406_185956.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/614/original/IMG_20150406_185956.jpg)
[![IMG_20150406_190043.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/615/medium/IMG_20150406_190043.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/615/original/IMG_20150406_190043.jpg)
[![IMG_20150406_190121.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/616/medium/IMG_20150406_190121.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/616/original/IMG_20150406_190121.jpg)


fold the bottom flap up and through, and slide the front of the cuvette holder down on it:

[![IMG_20150406_190305.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/618/medium/IMG_20150406_190305.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/618/original/IMG_20150406_190305.jpg)
[![IMG_20150406_190219.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/617/medium/IMG_20150406_190219.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/617/original/IMG_20150406_190219.jpg)

Now close up the other end of the frame:

[![IMG_20150407_163741.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/619/medium/IMG_20150407_163741.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/619/original/IMG_20150407_163741.jpg)

Now assemble the laser attenuator:

[![IMG_20150407_150115.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/621/medium/IMG_20150407_150115.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/621/original/IMG_20150407_150115.jpg)
[![IMG_20150407_150347.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/622/medium/IMG_20150407_150347.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/622/original/IMG_20150407_150347.jpg)
[![IMG_20150407_150502.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/623/medium/IMG_20150407_150502.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/623/original/IMG_20150407_150502.jpg)

Place in front of the spectrometer, add cuvettes and a 405nm laser pointer, and you're done:
