Can an oil slick be picked up off the surface and concentrated in to just oil?  I did a suggestive early experiment using [PIG Mats](http://www.newpig.com/pig/US/pig-oil-only-absorbent-mat-pack-mat750?cm_cat=shop_by_product), a cheap oil-only absorbent mat for industrial usage.  They are made of non-woven polypropylene.

I poured a little vegetable oil on top of a small container of water, and then swished a piece of the PIG Mat around. It picked up the oil but not the water, as advertised.

I was able to wring the oil back out of the mat.

Will this work with crude on an ocean surface? Maybe!  Any thoughts on how to run a test ethically are much appreciated!
