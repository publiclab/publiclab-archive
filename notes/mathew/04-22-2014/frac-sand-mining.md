# Frac Sand mining- polar light microscopy?

With the increase in fracking comes a demand for sand used to keep hydraulic fractures open.  Not just any sand will do-- it has to have the right particulate size, and therefore is best sourced by crushing and sorting sandstone.  [To read a summary of silica monitoring, see the wiki page I just made.](/wiki/silica)

###Particle Monitoring for Silica
Several open source projects are currently pursuing particulate monitoring, the [Dustduino](/notes/Schroyer/11-23-2013/measure-coarse-and-fine-air-particulates-with-a-dustduino), [Speck](http://publiclab.org/notes/chrisbartley/04-15-2014/speck-particle-monitor), and perhaps even the [Open Lux Board](/notes/Schroyer/11-23-2013/measure-coarse-and-fine-air-particulates-with-a-dustduino#c8845)

As I pointed out in the [Silica wiki page](/wiki/silica), most dust monitoring has traditionally occurred in occupational environments where the total dust exposure was assumed to be largely of the particles of concern.  In a fenceline community, dust could be from any number of sources, so particulate characterization becomes key.  Gross particulate measurements such as PM10(For an overview of [particle monitoring terms, see the wiki](wiki/particle-sensing)) require correlation with Wind direction, local soil conditions, and a variety of factors.  These correlations will require some sort of identification of silica.

###Identifying Silica

####Polar Light Microscopy

Scanning [dust that has settled on a sticky pad or in a filter has been a method of dust monitoring.](http://www.sustainableaggregates.com/sourcesofaggregates/landbased/dust/dust_monitoring.htm)  with a high-quality scanner or microscope and polarized light microscopy, could silica be picked out?  the silica particles above are the most colorful.  [Other methods](/wiki/silica) that are traditionally used involve X-rays.

There might also be an infrared method of analysis, detailed in this paper.  I have to get it and read it:
Pandurangi, R. S.; Seehra, M. S.; Razzaboni, B. L.; Bolsaitis, P. (1990) Surface and bulk infrared modes of crystalline and amorphous silica particles: a study of the relation of surface structure to cytotoxicity of respirable silica. Environ. Health Perspect. 86: 327-336.
