##What I want to do
resolve open questions from my [last batch of slit tests.](/notes/mathew/09-25-2013/photo-printed-collimation-slit-for-the-backpack-spectrometer)
 
1) figure out of the messy spectra I got pointing out a window was the result of obstacles in the path of my spectra.  [(see comments to Jeff's note)](/notes/warren/09-25-2013/stepped-slit-tests)

2)  test the distance the slit worked accurately at.

##My attempt and results
Hardware was a borrowed iphone 4S.

shot down my block before sunset, this image clearly shows the three telephone poles receding in the slit's view (the three  black lines, horizontal in SW) :

The fuzzyness I saw in the earlier solar spectrum was obstacles like leaves.  Problem solved.  This object identification is kinda cool, and helps me pick things out from the landscape:

I then wanted to see how far away I could pick up a streetlight's mercury emission lines to test distance:

Visible from 30 meters, facing sunset. Again, the pole of the streetlight is visible in the image. This image identication helped me focus on the streetlight itself:

Visible from From 50 meters, facing away from sunset:

##Questions and next steps
I'm really satisfied with the new slit design!  I can't wait to try to [pick out flares with it.](/notes/eustatic/07-31-2013/can-we-kick-it-yes-we-can-flickering-flare-signal)
