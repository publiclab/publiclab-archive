###What I want to do
answer two questions: Can straylight be eliminated in a simple spectrometer setup through using a double slit?  Can a double slit reduce the length of the spectrometer?


###My attempt and results
I took the block that comes with the desktop spectrometry kit and cut two grooves in it cross-wise.

then i aligned two slits in the front and parallel groove in the block, and attached a DVD slice to the angle, and a webcam mounted on a block parallel to the DVD:

Then I put the whole thing in a small box for some light-proofing:

###Questions and next steps

Waving it around there is definitely no stray light and it gives a clear spectrum.  The .18mm slits are a little small for capturing much light from fluorescence spectra.  I'm going to trade them out for some laser cut slits tomorrow and try again.

###Why I'm interested
it would be easier to mount a spectrometer on a smartphone and other devices if it were smaller and more rigid.
