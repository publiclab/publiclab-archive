From the meta-science dept: [SurfaceStations](http://www.surfacestations.org/) aims to photograph all the NOAA weather stations and determine if they are set up correctly, so that this info can inform historical climate data. They also maintain a [great set of resources](http://www.surfacestations.org/resources.htm) about weather stations and how to set them up that could be very useful to people looking at air quality sensors and air column monitoring.
