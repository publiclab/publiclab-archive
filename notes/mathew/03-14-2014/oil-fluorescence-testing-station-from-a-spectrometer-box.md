###What I want to do
modify the standard desktop spectrometer box to hold the laser, spectrometer, and sample bottle in the same repeatable locations.  These are the components of our [alpha version sampling kit](/notes/mathew/02-22-2014/20-oil-testing-kits-draft-1), for [sale here](http://store.publiclab.org/collections/spectrometry/products/spectrometry-sampling-kit).

###My attempt and results
I cutup three boxes, and then made this pattern [download a PDF](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/003/272/original/cutpattern.pdf)

###Questions and next steps
make a print-ready PDF & vector file with measurements
