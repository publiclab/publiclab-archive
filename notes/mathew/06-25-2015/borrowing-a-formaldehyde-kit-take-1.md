# Borrowing a Formaldehyde Kit, Take 1

###What I want to do
Mail a [DIY Formaldehyde](/notes/nshapiro/11-03-2014/diy-formaldehyde-test-kit) Lending [Library Kit](/notes/mathew/05-28-2015/formaldehyde-testing-kit-for-lending) out to five people, and have them use it successfully.  

In that spirit, I've put together a few things: a revised [photo card](/notes/warren/03-30-2015/diy-formaldehyde-test-photo-card), instructions (this research note, actually), [pre-scored Kitagawa 710 tubes](/notes/nshapiro/11-03-2014/diy-formaldehyde-test-kit#c11702), and reformatted temperature correction lookup table.

You can watch me use it in this video:

###Instructions

###Welcome!
Public Lab's Lending Library has mailed you a DIY Formaldehyde Testing Kit for 7 days.  Please only use the number of tests you've paid for.  You will find a mailing schedule attached, with your loan period and the number of tests you've paid for. If a test needs to be redone please email mathew@publiclab.org to make sure there is an extra tube available.

###Preparing for a test
Tests take 30 minutes and can only be performed between 50-95 degrees Fahrenheit (10-35 degrees Celsius) and when relative humidity is between 5-90%. A thermometer/hygrometer is included in the kit to check these values.

To prepare for a test, please close all windows and doors for 24 hours.  This assures consistency between tests. 

###Testing
Verify the temperature is between 10-35 degrees Celsius, and humidity is between 5-90%.

Place meter in the middle of the room, and plug it in.

Remove Kitagawa tube box, and select an unbroken tube.  Write info down on the included test card, as shown below.  Tubes serial number is printed just above "JAPAN" on the bottom of the tube. [Download card here.](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/433/original/Test_photo-card-3.pdf)

Break the tube ends off over a trash can using the brass end breaker:

push tube down into the black rubber stopper, with the arrow facing downwards, and the writing towards the bottom:

turn the timed relay on (this is the only tricky, prototype-y thing)  use a pick or the cap to a pen to switch this tiny hidden switch from right to left.  You won't have to do this in the final version.

Record your start time and ress the big red button ONCE.  It starts a 30 minute timer.  In future versions of the kit you won't be able to reset the timer by hitting the button.

At the end of 30 minutes, finish filling out the photo card.  Use the chart below to lookup your temperature-adjusted reading. [download the chart](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/436/original/Kitagawa_710_lookup_table-mod.pdf)
