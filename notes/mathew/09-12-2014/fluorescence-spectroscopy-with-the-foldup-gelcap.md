###What I want to do
See bright fluorescence spectra with a fold up.

###My attempt and results

While a little messy from the reflections of the laser, there is a chlorophyll peak at 670nm that is greater than 25% strength. Its the strongest fluorescence I've gotten from olive oil.

My device was simple, a small 1/4" x 1/4" chamber for a [#4 gel cap](/notes/mathew/09-05-2014/using-gelatin-caps-for-oil-fluorescence).

I had to wrap the sides of the fold=up to prevent light leakage.  the Nexus 5's protruding camera makes lightproofing difficult.
