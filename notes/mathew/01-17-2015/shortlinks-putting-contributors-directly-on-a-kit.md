###What I want to do
I want to help users of Public Lab kits understand community research that goes into the kits and lead them back into our research notes and wiki pages.

###My attempt and results
A few months ago @warren and I were talking about including more research notes in the instructions with kits and strategies to increase engagement with our research process in kit design, and we hit on the idea of printing straight onto the parts of the kit effected by the research. Jeff implemented a short link system for notes that would make them small enough to fit in and around kit pieces, and this will be our first try at it, printing onto our new spectrometry kit. 

here are a series of notes printed on the side, along with the geometry of the interior.  notes below by: @amysoyka, @straylight, @wagnerc4, @ygzstc, @cfastie, @stoft, & @Alex-McCarthy.

on the bottom of the box it will read:
**what does /n/### mean?**

these little notes are an abreviation for a web address. Add in publiclab.org/n/### to fill out the web address and see community research that lead to this spectrometer in your hands. Post your own research to see it included in future kits!
