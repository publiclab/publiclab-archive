# Illustrating Infragram Point & Shoot Instructions

###What I want to do
Use Sketchup models of the Mobius action cam to illustrate instructions on its use.  The [existing instructions are hard to read](http://www.mytempfiles.info/mobius/) and could use illustrations. They also [rely on pages in the RC Groups Forums](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=25170908&postcount=3).  I want to make a single document of instructions.

###My attempt and results
I found Henrik Sandaker Palm's [Mobius Sketchup model on Grabcad](https://grabcad.com/library/mobius-action-camera-1), contacted Henrik to see if he was ok with me using it (he was!) and modified it to [add the buttons and re-uploaded it.](https://grabcad.com/library/mobius-action-camera-with-buttons-1).
the files are also attached below.

I then wanted a clean vector image showing the ports and buttons, so I exported a PNG file from Sketchup 2014 Make and traced it in Illustrator to make an SVG.  I wish I could just render a good looking file out of "Make" but can't seem to.  that's what you see above.  I'm going to repeat the process for other views I need to get the line art I want.

###Questions and next steps

I'm going to start re-writing the Mobius manual so it 1) prints & photocopies easily and 2) is easy to read.

How do I actually make nice renderings from Sketchup 2014 Make?
