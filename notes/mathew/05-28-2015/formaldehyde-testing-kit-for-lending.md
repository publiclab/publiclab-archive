# Formaldehyde Testing Kit for Lending 

###What I Want to Do
Building on a conversation that @NShapiro, @Warren, and @DanBeavers and I have been having in Nick's note on his [DIY Formaldehyde testing kit](/notes/nshapiro/11-03-2014/diy-formaldehyde-test-kit) and our desire to lower the barriers to testing by mailing around air pumps in our [lending library](/wiki/lending-library). 

My goals are three-fold: make the kit robust and easily shippable, prevent user error with automatic shutoff, and (potentially) remove the most expensive component, the flow control valve.

###My additions

In addition to @nshapiro's [parts list](/notes/nshapiro/11-03-2014/diy-formaldehyde-test-kit) I've added:

* an [arcade-style big red button](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9336)
* a timed relay
* a hard case (Seahorse SE300)
* a laser-cut  1/4" thick case panel [file](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/043/original/seahorse-box-plate-template.pdf) (the red lines are cut lines, blue are markings)

The panel is held on with 3/4" long #4 screws, the relay is held in place with 1" #4 bolts, and the formaldehyde tube is held in place with a 3/8" screw hook.

**Unfinished bits:**

* there is a place for a [3" x 5" info card](/notes/warren/03-30-2015/diy-formaldehyde-test-photo-card) but no card.
*there should be a thermometer and hygrometer in the lower right
* there is no [flow-restrictor on the intake valve, as I discussed](/notes/nshapiro/11-03-2014/diy-formaldehyde-test-kit#c11699) in @nshapiro's note's comments
* Ionically, the material I had around to laser cut was MDF, a material well-known to off-gas formaldehyde.  I'll find something else soon.
