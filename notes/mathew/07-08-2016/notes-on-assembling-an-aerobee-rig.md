I purchased an [Aerobee rig](/notes/cfastie/07-05-2016/the-aerobee-rig) from the [KAPtery](http://kaptery.com) because I'm real excited about the [Jerk Pan mechanism](/notes/cfastie/01-27-2016/the-jerkpan).  Our unpredictable late spring rains  (its still spring in Oregon) have kept me from getting a good flight window to test this rig, but I hope to have it in the air soon. 

I got an early version of the instructions and assembly.  Overall, the assembly was straightforward and low-stress.

###Issues

One sticking point was the leg brackets. the clearance for the screws forced me to jam them in at odd angles.

The plastic right under the leg attachment didn't have enough clearance for a nut, and had to be trimmed with a knife:

I'd suggest a change to the 3D printed file to get a little more clearance.

The hitch pins are almost impossible to get into the pendulum kit without stretching them open with pliers, then the kit easily assembles and disassembles:

###Pendulum kit:
Some modifications to the pendulum kit are necessary to fit the jerkpan on the bottom.  @cfastie may have already changed the instructions on this assembly.

The instructions specify the need for a 5/64", 5/16" drill bits.  I used a 1/16", 3/32", 7/64, and 1/8" 

they replace the current drill instructions in the following locations:
