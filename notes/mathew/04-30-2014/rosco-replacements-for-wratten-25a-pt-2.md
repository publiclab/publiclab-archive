###What I want to do
test the three Rosco theatrical filters identified during a [search for a replacement for the Red Wratten 25A](/notes/mathew/04-29-2014/a-wratten-25a-replacement-from-rosco), using [Chris fastie's white balance settings ](/notes/cfastie/04-26-2014/mobius-ndvi)

###My attempt and results
First, a comparison of the same scene through three filters.  I did an NDVI using the HSV method on Infragram.org, its just Blue - Red / Blue + Red, assuming that Infrared is in the blue channel, and visible in the red.  I also did a Blue-Red to look at the channel differentiation.

##Blue Minus Red

It seems like #26 has a slightly higher differentiation between blue and red channels.  19 & 25 seem very similar.

##NDVI

###Questions and next steps

I took more extensive photos with #25 first, before taking the comparison shots.  there seemed to be a few problem shots, not sure how bad they are:
