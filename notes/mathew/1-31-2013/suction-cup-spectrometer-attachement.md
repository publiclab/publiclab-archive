I've been trying to come up with spectrometer to phone attachment method that can fit anything and not leave a sticky trace.  
I was inspired by the [Empire Universal Silicone Suction Cup Stand](http://www.empirecase.com/Suction_Phone_Stand.html), shown to me by [Nick Chelyapov](http://nickolaspeter.com/) (pictured in the gallery above). It sticks well to any phone, even when there is a textured back, like on my Samsung Galaxy S II.

I grabbed a 2cm and 4cm sizes of standard transparent PVC suction cups.  They won't stick dry, but if I wet them they'll stay for several hours at least.  The silicone suction cup stand stuck much better when dry.

I was still able to make a successful holder with a little wire:

Although fairly sturdy, there was a slight inconsistency between two takes after the spectrometer was jostled and put nose down on the table:

It would be nice to use silicone suction cups, although I can't find them for regular sale outside of [glass eyeball removal suction cups](http://www.ericksonlabs.com/Artifical_Eye_Suction_Cups_s/4.htm). only as a specialty item.  Silicone vacuum cups, used in manufacturing applications and attached to vacuum pump, [are available](http://www.vacuforce.co/#!cups/c1utl), and they can be [custom manufactured](http://www.allvacindustries.com/pages/suction_cups/6.php).  Alibaba has them too but the search for "silicone suction cup" get NSFW really fast.
