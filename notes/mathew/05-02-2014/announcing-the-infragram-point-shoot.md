The Infragram Point & Shoot is a [modified Mobius Action Cam](/search/mobius) with a 133 degree wide-angle lens, timelapse and still photography at a resolution of 2304 Ã— 1536, and 1080p video.  It is modified with a [red filter and custom white balance.](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-24-2014/mobius-white-balance)

in a reversal of our [Infrablue cameras](/search/infrablue), Infragram Point & Shoot captures visible light on the red channel, and infrared on the blue.

Its NDVI performance looks clear.  The red filter works much better than blue on CMOS cameras.  The infrared channel has its characteristic black skies and bright foliage

We'll have these in our store soon and will announce a release date for our Kickstarter reward shipment.
