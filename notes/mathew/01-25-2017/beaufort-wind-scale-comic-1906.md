The [Beaufort Scale][1]
is a means of measuring wind speed by visual inspection of indirect
factors like rustling leaves or waves on water. I think its a useful
means of assessing flight safety in the field.

The British
National Meteorological Library and Archive published an [excellent
history and overview of the development of the Beaufort Scale][2], and in
the back was a comic, drawn in 1906 by George Simpson, an explorer and
meteorologist who extended the Beaufort Scale from observations at sea
to observations on land. The comic is great. I cleaned it up so that
it would display better and could be used as a print handout:
