###What we want to do
I sat down with @warren to record a video presentation on the state of the [oil testing kit ](http://publiclab.org/wiki/oil-testing-kit) development. I would like to make videos like this about all the tools in development with Public Lab, contact me if you'd like to work on one.

###how we did it

I grabbed a video mixer recently to let me do live editing of presentations like this.  We plugged in a bunch of equipment we already had , and audio recorder for the sound, a point and shoot for the video, and a linux laptop as an image source (running a google presentation. These went into the mixer and then into my Mac for firewire video capture. Then took multiple takes live.  Maybe its trivial, but I really like the newscaster-style video in the corner, I think it makes a powerpoint-style presentation more compelling.

###Questions and next steps

The point and shoot was a crumby video source.  I also tried HDMI out from my phone, but the aspect ratio change from 16:9-4:3 looked bad.  I'm working on sourcing better HDMI to component YUV video to up the video quality.  

###Why I'm interested
Public lab folks do lots of presentations.  I want to capture them in a compelling way!
