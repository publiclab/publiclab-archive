###What I want to do
Buy 20 testing kits to Jeff's design.

The parts are as follows:
4 [square glass bottles](http://www.sciplus.com/p/WHITCAP-BOTTLE_48212)
2 [Droppers](http://www.sciplus.com/p/CAP-WDROPPER_39038)
1 [bottle](http://www.sciplus.com/p/green-bottle_45303) of [mineral oil](http://www.amazon.com/AniMed-Mineral-Oil-128-oz/dp/B004QHAJSQ/ref=lh_ni_t?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATPTY5SOCTDGP)
1 [Packet of Olive Oil](http://www.webstaurantstore.com/catania-spagna-extra-virgin-olive-oil-5-oz-portion-packet-105-case/125PCOILOLIV.html?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GoogleShopping&gclid=CP620vWos7wCFU9p7AodDHAArQ)
1 "405nm" 5mw [laser pointer](http://lightpoint-tech.en.alibaba.com/product/880983909-219571309/wholesale_5mw_to_200mw_5_in_1_405nm_Blue_violet_laser_pointer_pen_with_five_laser.html)

###My attempt and results
All items arrived as described.  The 405nm lasers seem to be a little off, but they say "+/- 10%"  The one I tested was 397nm.
