###What I want to do
see if we use gelatin caps as sample containers.  They cost a few cents each, 100 for $5 at my local pharmacy.  I picked up 25 each of sizes 4-00.

###My attempt and results
The gel caps have a lensing effect because of the shape, it is more severe the bigger the gel cap. The smallest #4, which was only a little bigger than the laser beam was the easiest to make fluoresce.  I filled them with olive oil for my tests.

I moved the slit to the outside of my conduit box so I could get my samples right up against it, and then made a little tube out of black aluminum foil to slide the gel caps in.

I also tried them sideways.  Only the #4 worked sideways. by just holding it.

The two big curves fluorescing at 670nm are a glass jar (control) and the #4 gel cap.  The other caps, probably from the lensing, didn't work as well.  The #4 worked as well as a glass container with the laser aligned perfectly, very close to the glass and along the slit. 

I also tried out one of the cuvettes Jeff sent me, but couldn't get the fluorescence to read at any angle.

###Questions and next steps
The gel caps weren't too hard to fill, but I always got a little oil outside (I used a dropper).  So its not super clean.  They don't seem to leak though, however they are hard to label and easy to crush.

###Why I'm interested.
at 5 cents they're cheap and work great and are easy to get. they don't need a big sample, but perhaps need a mixing container.
