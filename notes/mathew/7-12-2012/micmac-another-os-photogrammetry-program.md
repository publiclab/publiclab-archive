This just in from [the KAP forums](http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/kap/discuss/comments.php?DiscussionID=2587&page=1#Item_0)-- [MicMac](http://www.micmac.ign.fr/) is an open source platform for generating point cloud data from images.  It's an alternative to [OpenCV](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/), and appears to have been developed and mainly used in France.  [Here is a rough overview of a workflow for building a 3d model.](http://www.tapenade.gamsau.archi.fr/TAPEnADe/Workflow.html), a [published paper on the topic](http://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXVIII/1-C22/papers/remondino.pdf).

The [MicMac site](http://www.micmac.ign.fr/) could use some work, I can't find the english FAQ, but the [forums](http://forum-micmac.forumprod.com/) seem active.  Some Francophone Public Lab folks should hop in!
