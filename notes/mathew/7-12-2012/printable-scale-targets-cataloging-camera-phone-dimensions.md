In this photo I used the scale linked below and traced my camera's vertical profile onto the page, then photographed everything in the bathroom mirror to get the exact dimensions of my canon S90.

###Ideas### 
A simple target that could be printed onto a piece of paper and used as a photo background to take calibrated, to-scale photos of objects, specifically cameras and phones.  Traditional options for field work are printable scales [like this one](http://web.ncf.ca/jim/scale/), a dime, penny or other coin.  From the air we use [ground control points](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/mapping-curriculum-ground-control-point-targets).

I'm thinking of including a scale like this in the next Grassroots Mapping Forum, to kickstart the collection of a database.

###use cases###
####grassroots mapping bottle rigging####
One issue with our [bottle rigging](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/pet-bottle-rubber-band-rig) for cameras is that many people want to know which bottle will work with their camera, without walking around a grocery store/recycling facility, trying to eyeball their camera against a bottle.  We maintain [a spreadsheet of bottle dimensions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AvhkyHiIJbp0dFhRWmxwby11VERHQmVfclVxanRkTEE&single=true&gid=0&output=html), but me and Stewart are the only folks who've added to it, and we link people to [digital photography review](http://www.dpreview.com) to get dimensions on their cameras.

####cell phone spectrometer mount####
Jeff has been working on an [Android version of spectral workbench, and a simple mount for attaching a spectral filter to the camera](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/6-12-2012/mobile-android-version-spectral-workbench).  He has a SketchUp file in that note for printing an attachment.  It would be cool to know the dimensions of a lot of Android phones so as to create a parametric, printable attachement (or adjustable attachment) that can accomodate all those phones.

###Pie in the sky###
the same target could also serve as a photo target which could be used for [calculating the lens distortion](/wiki/mapknitter-correcting-lens-distortion) of different cameras, potentially integrated with to the [Lensfun](http://lensfun.berlios.de/) database.  Someone could therefore take a photo of their camera on the target, and then take a photo of the target, and we get the dimensions and lens info together.  [Here are some example photo targets](http://jmloptical.com/pages/test-targets.aspx)

<b>adding software</b>
something like photo stretching functions in Mapknitter could be used to scale the scale targets digitally + vector trace their profiles would help too.  For lens calibration, perhaps just using [hugin](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/download/).  There's also [matlab camera calibration toolbox](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/htmls/parameters.html), and [a lot of papers on calibration](http://iris.usc.edu/vision-notes/bibliography/active668.html).
