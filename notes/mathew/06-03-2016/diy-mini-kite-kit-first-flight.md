###Background
Inspired by @PatCoyle's look at [small, cheap parafoil kites for mapping,](/notes/patcoyle/07-20-2015/small-parafoil-kite-for-mobius-camera) I've been looking for a stable, sparless kite that could lift a small camera and pack down easily into a backpack. At the same time, @TonyC has been working to make some super-simple rigs for flying the [Mobius action cam.](https://publiclab.org/tag/diy-mount-kit) 

With the spring here, I was finally able to fly a camera on my kite and demonstrate that it could lift a Mobius.  While still an early-stage kit with limited testing, @TonyC rolled these up into [a kit in the Public Lab store.](http://store.publiclab.org/collections/mapping-kits/products/diy-mini-kite-kit)

###My small kite:
Last fall I bought a [7.5 square foot parafoil kite from In the Breeze kites.](http://www.inthebreeze.com/prod-38-1-497-282/7-5-rainbow-air-foil.htm)  Its flight performance was disappointing, as it hunted a lot and would turn over in higher winds.  It didn't approach the 25mph top wind speed advertised, and became unstable at about 15mph. 

So I modified the kite.  I sewed two little tabs of ribbon onto the two back corners and bridled a piece of string between them, and then attached the tail.

With the tail bridled like that, its a rock solid flyer.  I tested it in  20mph winds with 25mph gusts and it held steady.  Here it is lifting a mobius in lower wind:

For the Mini Kite Kit, we had an upholstery shop down the hall from our office sew tabs onto the back of the In The Breeze 7.5' parafoil. They did a much neater job than I did.

###The Camera Rig

I used @TonyC's mobius rigging, detailed here:

Its pretty stable. It gets a bit of a pendular motion.

I haven't gotten it high enough to get any good shots yet, but here are are few from low altitude:

###Next steps
I need to fly the camera more!  I'm interested in more sophisticated rigs for oblique shots and panoramas.  I'm excited to have a stable kite that fits in my backpack.
