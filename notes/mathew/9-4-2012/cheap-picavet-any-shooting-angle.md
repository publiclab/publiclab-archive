Inspired by Jesse Breen's picavets [1](/notes/jbreen/3-6-2012/evolution-picavet), [2](/notes/jbreen/6-23-2012/fabaoutfit-derivative-kap-rig), and the [FABA collective's](/notes/juan/6-5-2012/fabaoutfit-vertical-kap-and-bap) picavets, I made a picavet rigging out of six [mini carabiners](http://www.windycitynovelties.com/6234p/carabineer-keychains.html), six #64 rubberbands, and [a sterilite mini crate.](http://www.amazon.com/Sterilite-16958612-Small-Storage-Crate/dp/B002BL4HTQ).  Total cost of materials is about 5 bucks, except that I had to buy 12 crates (contact me if you want one).  The rig weighs 216 grams without a camera-- making it more than twice the 60-100g weight of a [PET bottle rig](/wiki/pet-bottle-rubber-band-rig).

The major advantage, besides stability of the Picavet, is that the carabiners can be moved around the crate without re-rigging the Picavet, allowing photos to be shot from a bunch of different angles.

The rubber band mount inside is just two doubled up rubber bands with four attachment points. [Another view of it is here.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/14397636@N07/7795950170/in/photostream)  The rubber band mount seems to introduce some vibration in the higher wind test I did, but it could have been that I was paying more attention to my kite in the gusty conditions and did a bad job setting up the camera.

I did two video tests with a GoPro-- one in extremely low wind-- 5-7mph up high, with gusts and barely any wind at ground level, and another in extremely gusty wind ranging from 7-15mph.  They're both here, second test starts 2 minutes in.  The crate is in both shots because of the GoPro's fisheye lens.  a regular camera wouldn't have that issue.
In the second test the GoPro's strap gets in the shot-- I wasn't paying much attention to the camera, more to my kite in the gusty conditions:
