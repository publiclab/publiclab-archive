For reasons of pedigree I'm optimistic about the functionality of this design and want to try building a scaled down replica out of mylar sleeping bags.  The crucial features that I want to integrate are 1) the use (I think) of a [Picavet style rigging](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/picavet-rigging) to hang the payload, and 2) the use of two side-by-side envelopes.

In doing some biographical research on the career of Domina Jalbert and the pre-WWII aerospace team at Goodyear, I stumbled on R.H. Upson, a distinguished engineer whose career spanned from [balloon races to space planes](http://www.nasm.si.edu/research/arch/findaids/upson/rhu_print.html).  
Through the google group kite patents I found [a 1916 kite balloon](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/kitepatents/message/272) design I'd previously not known about.

Morphologically, Upson's balloon is two Parseval-Sigsfeld balloons with airfoil-like profiles strapped to each other. The payload appears to be suspended via a [Picavet style rigging](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/picavet-rigging).  See more of history on the [kite-balloon hybrid page](http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/kite-balloon-hybrid).  I can't find any pictures of one actually in existence and know that the Caquot-type balloon was actually fielded by the US, not Upson's design.

Upson's streamlining of the balloon envelopes into airfoil profiles was a technique also used by Domina Jalbert in the 40's and 50's in his kite balloons.  I think he could have been influenced by R.H. Upson.  I can't prove it, but it seems unlikely that they wouldn't have known each other, having both worked at Goodyear and both being obsessed with aerostats.
