Instead of using a balled up piece of tape, a pebble, or some other thing to hold down my camera's shutter, I've gone to using a knot.  This makes it easy to hold in place, and makes setting it easier.  I prefer [a rubber band](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/rubber-bands), but tape also holds it down.  tape may be more useful for bulging, non rectangular cameras.

My Canon SD1000 needs the [rubber band](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/rubber-bands) tripled up to hold it in place:
