###What I want to do
go flying on a friday morning.  Not enough wind for a kite today.  We did try putting a Redstone Rig up on a [hooperfly quadcopter](http://hooperfly.com).

this wobbled a lot.  we tightened the line up so it was only hanging a few inches down as well and it became much more stable, but still had stability issues.  The picavet eliminated the blurriness from motor vibration, but wasn't worth the stability tradeoff.

In the image above, i like how the mower tracks stick out, a way they don't in visible light.
