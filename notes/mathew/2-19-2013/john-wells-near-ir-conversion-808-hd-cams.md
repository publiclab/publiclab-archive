John Wells is doing great things with keychain cams over at the West Lothian Archaeological Society.  Above is his simple pendulum rig made from a coat hanger for the cheap 808 keychain HD cams.  The top part is wrapped around the kite line to stay in place.

[He has also documented his instructions for converting them to near IR.](http://www.armadale.org.uk/808dinfraredconversion.htm)
