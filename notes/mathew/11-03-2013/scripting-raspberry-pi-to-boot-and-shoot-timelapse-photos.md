###What I want to do
I wanted to setup my Raspberry Pi to automatically boot and start shooting photos, so I could use it for aerial photography. I'd previously modded a pi camera to pull out the infrared filter, but the Raspberry Pi foundation had [sent me a pre-production model of the NoIR Pi cam](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/tag/pi-noir).  I took photos with the #74 filter and it worked great.

As this process was the first stage in making a stripped-down camera version of the raspberry pi, i didn't want it to load processor/memory/battery intensive processes; I wanted to auto-boot into command line mode.  I got it all working, below are some instructions.

This was a five-step process: 1) make a timelapse script, 2) make the script boot on login, and 3) set the Pi to automatically login on boot, 4) put it in a box with a battery, 5) go flying.

###My attempt and results

Here's my pi in a box with battery pack, using an old stand-alone gamecube monitor:

I got everything to work and [went flying with Rich Burton](http://www.diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/raspberry-pi-noir-and-public-lab-get-a-lift) and his [HooperFly quadcopter](hooperfly.com).  It couldn't go as high as I really wanted to go, but it was very steady, quick, and returned great photos.

#####Precautions:#####
in case I screwed up I made another user:
<pre><code>
sudo useradd {USERNAME}
sudo passwd {USERNAME}
</code></pre>

If anything went wrong, I used the command CTRL-ALT-F2 to start a new terminal and login as a different user and edit any of my scripts from a different session. This happened a bunch before i got the settings right.

#####Timelapse#####
I started by writing and checking a timelapse script.  I copied the work done by [Andrew Back at Design Spark](http://designspark.com/blog/time-lapse-photography-with-the-raspberry-pi-camera).  I changed around the directory and made the script shoot PNGs instead of JPGs to lower the image compression.

I created a script in the /etc/init.d directory, because this is where background processes are kept:

<pre><code>
sudo nano ~/etc/init.d/timelapse.ch
</code></pre>

This is the script:
<pre><code>
#!/bin/bash
#for automatically taking timelapse photos

ROLL=$(cat /home/pi/Desktop/images)

SAVEDIR=/home/pi/Desktop/images/timelapse

while [ true ]; do

filename=$ROLL-$(date -u + "%d%m%Y_%H%M-%S").png

raspistill -o $SAVEDIR/$filename

#sleep for 10 ten seconds

sleep 10;

done;
</code></pre>

You will have to change the permissions to make it executable:
<pre><code>
sudo chmod ugo+x/etc/init.d/timelapse.sh
</code></pre>

you can test the script then by typing:
<pre><code>
bash timelapse.sh
</code></pre>

#####Boot and Autorun#####
I then needed setup the pi to auto-login on boot, and load the script.

I setup an autologin starting with info from [AK Eric](http://www.akeric.com/blog/?p=1976) who summarized and condensed [this thread on the Raspberry Pi forums](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=7192).  The suggested line to add to inittab clearly wasn't right.  I found a different set of instructions on [Stackexchange](http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/3873/auto-login-with-gui-disabled-in-raspbian), and a discussion thread on the issue on the Raspberry Pi Forums.  After fixing the issue using the info from Stackexchange, I shared back to [the Forum issue](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=44801&p=409769#p409769).

go to inittab:
<pre><code>
sudo nano ~/etc/inittab
</code></pre>

find the line:
<pre><code>
1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty --noclear 38400 ttyl
</code></pre>

comment it out (#) and below add the line :
<pre><code>
1:2345:respawn:sbin/getty --autologin {USERNAME} --noclear 38400 tty1
</code></pre>

save and close (CTRL X)

go to:
<pre><code>
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
</code></pre>
go to the last line and add:
<pre><code>
echo .bashrc : Running /etc/init.d/timelapse.sh
bash etc/init.d/timelapse.sh
</code></pre>

###Questions and next steps

I'd wanted to shoot RAW, but RAW shooting is pretty new and looked like more work than I was up for.  [Here's the discussion on the 'Pi forums](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=44918&start=50) and [the RAW code on github](https://github.com/illes/raspiraw)

I also wanted to be able to [SSH into my Pi](http://nathanhfox.com/2013/07/31/configuring-the-raspberry-pi-as-a-headless-ethernet-to-computer-tether-w-internet-sharing-to-macbook-pro/) so I could modify it while "headless" (no screen/keyboard) in the field.  I didn't quite get that setup.

I also looked at changing the directory to load onto an external SD card, but had difficulty consistently recognizing and saving to it.  I had trouble writing to Fat32 memory cards, so ended up formatting a card using ext4, a linux file system. The problem with using ext4 is that the permissions have to be changed to allow each user on each system access. Its not a good camera-memory card format, and required plugging the card into my other linux box to read.  I'd like to figure out how to use standard FAT32 cardsâ€¦ But here's how to format an SD card for ext4:
<pre><code>
dmesg | tail
</code></pre>
found it as sdd:sdd1, unmounted it:
<pre><code>
sudo umount /dev/sdd
</code></pre>
then formatted it:
<pre><code>
sudo mkfs.ext4  'pisd'  /dev/sdd
</code></pre>
