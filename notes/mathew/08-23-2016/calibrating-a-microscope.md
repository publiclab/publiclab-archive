###What I want to do
I have an [openflexure microscope](/notes/mathew/07-21-2016/openflexure-microscope-high-resolution-assembly) and I want to calibrate it.  I've acquired two tools to do so, a [stage micrometer](http://meijitechno.com/ma285-1mm-divided-into-100-units), and [2.07μm Polystyrene Latex (PSL) Spheres by Ladd Research](http://www.laddresearch.com/polystyrene-latex-spheres). I have [previously documented](/notes/mathew/09-19-2015/using-imagej-to-process-passive-particle-monitor-samples#Setting+the+Scale) the method for calibration with the stage micrometer that i learned from @AmberWise and Andrew Maselli at Chicago State, and recently [replicated it with my OpenFlexure](/notes/mathew/07-21-2016/openflexure-microscope-high-resolution-assembly#Calibration,+Magnification,+image+defects) microscope.

But in order to check the particle sizing methods @SimonPyle has [automated](/notes/SimonPyle/05-13-2016/automating-imagej-for-particle-image-analysis) for use in [dust sensing](/wiki/passive-pm), I would like to compare particles of a known size to the measurements the analysis produces. 

###Experimental Goals
My goal is to understand whether a stage micrometer calibration is sufficient to accurately size small particles, since the stage micrometer is reusable and fairly affordable (less than $100). After analysis, I should be able to compare the average particle size of the particles (2.07μm) to the measured particles size. 

This will lay the groundwork for running (passive particle monitor samples)[https://publiclab.org/tag/passive-pm] here in support of our [development goals.](https://publiclab.org/wiki/pm-dev)

###Proposed Process
I'm going to prepare a slide with the PSL spheres, take a calibration image of the stage micrometer, and then take 40 images of the prepared slide with the microscope.  then run it through @simonpyle's ImageJ macro, followed by the [analysis spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xSVT9lxary0zZhhEqhrX3hsdIb4shbYhaOJx_RWhESg/edit#gid=0) @AmberWise and I put together. 

###Next Steps
time to do this!
