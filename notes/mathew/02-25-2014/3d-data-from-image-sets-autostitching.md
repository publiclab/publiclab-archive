On our weekly organizers call, we discussed software for doing 3D reconstructions from photos.  I thought I'd make one list of the options currently available.  Please add more in the comments if you know of any.

###Free & Open Source Software
[VisualSFM](http://ccwu.me/vsfm/) and [geobduffy](/users/geobduffy)'s [tutorial on it](/notes/geobduffy/07-13-2013/aerial-imagery-post-processing-tutorials-3d-point-clouds-orthomosaics-and-3d-models)

[MicMac](http://www.micmac.ign.fr/)  my [previous note on MicMac](/notes/mathew/7-12-2012/micmac-another-os-photogrammetry-program) [MicMac's english documentation](logiciels.ign.fr/IMG/pdf/docinterface.en.pdf) Mic Mac can supposedly do orthoimage creation too.

Python Photogrammetry Toolbox is available as a part of 
[ArcheOS](http://www.archeos.eu/wiki/doku.php/), a livedisk of linux with visualSFM & Python Photogrammetry toolkit installed.  [Here is a tutorial on its use](http://arc-team-open-research.blogspot.com/2012/12/how-to-make-3d-scan-with-pictures-and.html)

[OpenMVG](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~moulonp/openMVG/)

[Bundler](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/bundler/)

###Free or limited Free use Commercial Software
[Cubify](http://cubify.com/products/capture/) (formerly Hyper3D) 

[Photosynth](http://photosynth.net/)
