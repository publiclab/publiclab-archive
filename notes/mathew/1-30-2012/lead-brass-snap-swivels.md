Our balloon kit is nearly together but one thing has been vexing me-- trying to find a lead-free snap swivel. I like coast lock snap swivels, [like the ones sold at kitebuilder.com](http://www.kitebuilder.com/catalog/product_info.php/cPath/25_45/products_id/85) where I got my first coast lock snap swivel.  I tracked back this swivel to the [Sampo](http://www.sampoinc.com/index.htm) company, manufacturer of [Rosco swivels](http://www.sampoinc.com/ro_swi_coastlock.htm).  Through talking to wholesale suppliers I was referred to call Sampo, where I had a great conversation with Brian Butts, the owner.  Brian explained that his swivels, while some use brass bearings and some stainless ball bearings, all contain [360 brass](http://www.copper.org/applications/rodbar/alloy360/alloy360.html), which is 3% lead.  This is pretty much same amount of lead found in many keys, and is RoHS compliant (<4%). Brian tests himself for lead and has never had elevated levels. And [for machining reasons there are very good reasons to include a little lead.](http://www.productionmachining.com/articles/adjusting-to-unleaded).

Thanks to a suggestion by Liz Barry, I found some all-stainless hardware, the [American Fishing Wire Mighty Mini Snap Swivels.](http://www.americanfishingwire.com/mmsnapswivels.asp).  And they're cheaper, stronger, and because steel is more fatigue resistant, very likely more durable. Attached is the MSDS I got from Stephanie Farnum at AFW.
