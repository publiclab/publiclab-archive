###What I want to do
I want to keep electronics dry while wired to underwater sensors.  I did a short test of a simple system of caulk filled tubes stuck through rubber stoppers in the tops of pop bottles. I did a test [submerging it half a meter (18") down in a trashcan full of water.](/notes/mathew/01-16-2015/sketching-a-waterproof-pop-bottle-sensor-system)

###My attempt and results

**New additions to the design:**

* I used clear plastic tubing instead of brass tubing [(3/8" OD (outside diameter) PET tubing)](http://www.mcmaster.com/#9245k17/=w2k0n2)
* I ran wires down the length of the tube before filling with silicone caulk to simulate running sensors
* I filled the bottles with rice both to act as a desiccant (pulling moisture out of the air) and because it makes the bottle less compressible and I think will help maintain shape at depth.  Also, rice sticks to moisture and I can use that to tell whether the bottles leaked.

I could fit four wires off a 0.1" ribbon cable through the tube.

###Throwing it in the River

I threw it in and dragged it out three times just to be extra rough, then I tossed them about four feet (120cm) down.

I threw it in the water on the 16th of february and just picked it up at almost low-tide on the 25th (at 5:40pm). It was submerged under about 5' (150cm) of water at least some of last week.

here they are tied up at low tide when I retrieved them.
