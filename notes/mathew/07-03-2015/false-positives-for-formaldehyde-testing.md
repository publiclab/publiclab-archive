# False positives for Formaldehyde testing

###What I want to do
Understand why used Kitagawa tubes are turning pink in our fridge. We've been storing them in there for a while, and they've been stable-- i.e. if I put a tube in there it has the same reading the next day. Then, starting over the past two weeks they've been getting pinker (exposed) in the fridge.

###My attempt and results

Of recent additions to the fridge, the biggest and funkiest is definitely this half-gallon of kimchi I put there. I really like kimchi.  You can definitely smell it when you open the fridge.

Kimchi is actively decomposing, My suspicion is that these aromatic decomposition gasses are affecting the tubes.  [Kitagawa lists](http://www.komyokk.co.jp/pdata/tpdf/710_1.pdf) these false-positives and cofounding gasses:

Nitrogen dioxide is an intermediate component in [anaerobic metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_respiration), which is likely to be occurring in the kimchi.  Acetaldehyde may also be generated by partial metabolization of alcohol, although the lacto-fermentation of kimchi shouldn't generate that, I don't think. Acetaldehyde is also carcenogenic, but [at much higher concentrations than formaldehyde. ](http://www.epa.gov/chemfact/s_acetal.txt)

###Questions and next steps
What else do you think it is?

###Why I'm interested
confounding factors to formaldehyde testing are important to recognize and potentially account for with other tests.
