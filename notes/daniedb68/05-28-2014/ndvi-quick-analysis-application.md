FirstOff, I hope I'm allowed to post this here. First time, and new to everything :-(

###What I want to do
I'm completely new to NDVI photos and recently only receive my InfraBlue Filter Paper.
Reading on the web about NDVI, i try to figure out which colors represents what.
So I've written a small program for myself to try and analise the Photo

###My attempt and results
Quick show of the analysis 

###Questions and next steps

Comments, suggestions, put me on the right track, WELCOME...
