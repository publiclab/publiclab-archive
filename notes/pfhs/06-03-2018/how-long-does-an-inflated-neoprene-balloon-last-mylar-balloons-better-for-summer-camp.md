I am planning a week long summer camp around aerial mapping. My question is how long the balloons in the normal balloon kit (5 ft latex/neoprene) will stay inflated. Can I inflate them, fly them for an hour, bring them back down, store inside, and fly the next day? How many days would they be expected to last without a refill?

  
Also considering the mylar balloon mini kit for this very reason.

  
Anyone have experience with this?

  
Thanks,
