I am looking for a video or simple step-by-step online tutorial, suitable for students, describing the basics of balloon launching for aerial mapping (how to fill balloon, seal it, secure it to string, basics of launch and recovery, etc.). I am sure that there is something out there, but so far I have just found little bits of information here and there.

  
Thanks to all for your patience. I have been slamming the forum over the past week or so!
