I am preparing for a camp in two weeks and looking for sample aerial images from a Mobius Action Camera for the campers to practice their Mapknitter skills (e.g. for first day, before first launch). Anyone know where I could find some images from a previous flight? As I write this, I am also wondering whether Mapknitter provides access to the original images on its site? Any ideas are greatly appreciated! Thanks!
