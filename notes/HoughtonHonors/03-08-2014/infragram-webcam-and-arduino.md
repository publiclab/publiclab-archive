I am working on building a radiosonde (weather balloon). From this radiosonde I'd like to take NDVI pictures so I can see how the ratio of infrared to visible light changes with altitude. 

I am currently planning on running everything through an Arduino Due. I would like to take pictures using the Public Lab Infragram Webcam, however I'm struggling to find any information on how to set up the webcam with an Arduino. I can't even find how the Infragram Webcam handles it's communication.

At this point I think that the Arduino is going to be to weak to handle a camera. I thought someone here at Public Lab might have some insight either into how the Infragram Webcam worked or using an Arduino to take NDVI pictures.

Thanks!
