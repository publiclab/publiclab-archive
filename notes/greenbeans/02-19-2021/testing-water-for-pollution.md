How does location/ use of different bodies of water affect how polluted the water is?

Supplies needed:

Samples of water from different locations and bodies of water.

Tests:

Coliform bacteria test

Phosphate test

Potassium test

pH test

Dissolved oxygen test

Nitrate test

Locations: 

River 

Bayou 

Canal 

Creak 

Pond 

Lake

Procedure:

1.) Collect water samples from 6 different locations/ bodies of water.

2.) Test water samples for coliform bacteria, fluoride, sulfate, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate.

3.) Analyze and record data.

4.) Compare test results with the location/use of each water sample.

5.) Create graphs to illustrate results and comparisons.
