Hello,  
  
I am working on soil quality (in France) and in particular on nitrate measurement. I want to work on a low cost terrain meter.  
I am working with the official method of colorimetric measurement of nitrates / nitrites by Cadmium reduction and Griess reagent.  
  
I want to apply flow chemistry analysis techniques such as Flow Injection (FIA) or Sequential Injection (SIA).  
  
Do you know equivalent projects?  
Or resource persons interested in this challenge?  
  
Thanks in advance,  
Christophe
