This is a follow-up to [the discussion in this note](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/11-22-2013/white-balance-for-all).

###What I want to do

I want to use glow in the dark paint to calibrate camera color sensors. In this experiment I wanted to test whether it would be feasible to do (i.e. is the paint bright enough for the camera to pick up).

###My attempt and results

I photographed the green paint found in [Palmer 12-Pot Fluorescent Glow in the Dark Set](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003W0MRI8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) applied to a white sheet of paper. Other colors did not appear to be as bright so I thought green would be a good starting point.

I charged the paint using sunlight. I **did not** make any effort to ensure the maximum charge. It is possible that I could have gotten a better charge by using a more intense light source, angling the paper to face the sun directly and charging for longer periods of time. This is a photo of the paint while it was charging:

Next I photographed the paper using a Samsung Galaxy S3 with +2 exposure in a very dark room (there was some ambient light from outside the door):

I am unable to make out any green glow in the original picture, however, I when applied Aviary's Auto-enhance filter to it green blobs appeared:

###Questions:

* Is the paint bright enough to effectively do calibration? I think it might not be since the intensity of each channel might only range from 0-2.
* Are there any camera apps that allow longer exposure times? In the live preview mode?
* Could I spatially average the pixel intensities to get a more precision in my measurements?

###Next steps:

1. Try to get the paint to glow with greater intensity.
2. See if other colors will show up.
3. Create a rainbow glow-in-the-dark calibration card and see if I can use it to calibrate two different cameras so the colors in a reference scene match up.
