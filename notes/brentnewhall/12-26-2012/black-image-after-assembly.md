Hi, all! I'm greatly looking forward to helping out with spectrometry.  
  
I'm using the kit, and followed all instructions. Everything seemed to go fine. I removed the IR filter, refocused using a bar code at 9", and completed assembly.  
  
But now when I focus my spectrometer at a CFL bulb at 9", all I get is a black image. If I bring my spectrometer up to 1" from the bulb, I simply see a vague white smear on one side.  
  
Pictures attached. Anyone have any idea what I may have done wrong?
