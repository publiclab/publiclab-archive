###Mount a camera on a pole
So, we just got in our new low aerial mapping poles, which will shortly be "kittified." The idea is that these are relatively cheap alternative to drones and kites. Where you may bump up against regulations with flying objects (even toys), nothing can touch a super long pole with a camera on top! (They are also great for swatting pesky drones.) The poles we have in stock now are the Ron Thompson Gangster Carp Pole.

They are all carbon fiber and fully extended 11 meters long or about 36ft. The sections are "put over" rather than telescopic, which makes it impossible to collapse due to weight.
These poles are super long and are likely to be the longest selfie pole ever. If I can just mount the camera. Started out first with our small [Mobius Infragram](http://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram-point-shoot).

###Sourcing Hardware and junk drawer options
Standard camera/tripod mounts are not a problem. I am confident that I can source these fairly inexpensively and throw them in with the pole kits. The problem is mounting them to the pole. First attempts Noah and I used velcro straps and plastic ties from the balloon kits. Not much success there. I got the idea to use a pen cap and barrel from diy (homemade/jailhouse) tattoo guns. The pen barrel fits like a sleeve over the thin part of the pole

The tip of the barrel, sometimes removable on pens makes the cap slide on easy

Anyway, after the barrel was sleeved, I took two caps and punched holes in the tops so that they would slide over the pole.

Then I fit the arm of the tripod mount in between them and connected the caps pushing them together inside each, making a pocket to hold the mounting piece. As shown

And above,

The thing about it is, is that this ended up working really well. They tension of all the pieces holds it into place. For added security you could put a rubber band or zip-tie around the whole thing, but it is surprisingly very rigid as is and still allows you to adjust the angle with the mount.
But let's be honest, my science is a little jenky here, so...


###Ideas? Links to share?
What are your thoughts? Now that you see what I am trying to accomplish, in an inexpensive and accessible way, what would you do or try? Are there similar things you have seen or maybe tried? Parts that I could find at any hardware store and do this same thing? Maybe 3d print something small and simple. I'm sure [cfastie](/profile/cfastie) has a way to super charge this!I've seen this guy, [our main competitor](http://www.polepixie.com/pixiepole.cfm), and these things

which might be better options, but let me know what you think.

###I want this kit to be easy, out of the box ready.
I don't want to have to source expensive specialty hardware that is difficult for someone else to replicate. I am looking to our balloon mapping kit and the soda bottle camera mount for inspiration here. Along those lines preferably.
