###What I want to do
I would like to see if the "low-cost" webcam we are using currently for our Desktop Sprectrometer Kit will work as an Infragram webcam by installing the red filter (specifically the Rosco "Fire" #19)

###First attempt and results
I cut and installed a circular red filter under the lens of the spec cam and screwed it back on. Then I plugged it into the labtop and opened Infragram.org. Hit begin and so far have collected two images, one with raw capture selected. The second image which didn't turn out so good, is the preset NDVI  capture with red filter installed, no colormap.(right here--->) 
[![222.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/005/662/medium/222.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/005/662/original/222.jpg) The blob in the middle is a tree, as seen from my office window.
###Update Second attempts and results
Okay, here we have a new SpecCam in focus with no filter, raw capture on Infragram.org. One pic of me the other of a live plant on the left, and a dead leaf branch on the right, with a white poster board for the background. The third picture is with the office fluorescent lights on and natural lighting coming from the right office window.

[![Live_Dead.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/005/689/medium/Live_Dead.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/005/689/original/Live_Dead.jpg)Live Plant (left) Dead (right) Raw Capture No Filter

So why is the plant brown and not green. Do I need to white balance it? and how?

###Next
These pictures are from Infragram.org Raw Capture with red filter and then blue filter taped over the lens.

The focus was a little off with the red filter pics. I think it is because the filter wasn't all the way tape against the lens.

###After
Infragram.org NDVI Capture with red filter over lens followed by blue filter over lens.

###AND FINALLY

The next 3 were taken in the sandox @Infragram.org using my clip on webcam I use for Skyping. First is Raw with no filter, second is Raw with Red Filter, and third is NDVI capture with Red Filter ColorMap. I didn't do blue filter testing on this since it was a last minute comparison. @mathew maybe you can answer where my Skype webcam came from and the cost????

What do you think folks?!? @warren, @mathew, @cfastie

###Questions and next steps
What do I need to do to get quality captures? How do I set the white balance? Has anyone else tried this yet? Is anyone else willing to try it and/or walk through it with me? Maybe I should try a blue filter? What is the benefit of one over the other in this case? @warren @mathew @cfastie @liz @GreenLeaves @NoahHochman

###Why I'm interested
The webcam we use for the Desktop Spectrometer Kit is much more cost effective to produce. If we could also use if for the Infragram Kit it would allow us to bring the cost down and offer a more attractive price point for both individuals and bulk buyers.

###Update

Trying for full res....
