***UPDATE*** 7/29/14
We have received the first 100 point and shoot cameras and are getting them ready to ship. We are still waiting on the SD cards to arrive, but they should be in this week along with 300 more cameras. Shipping should begin early next week! Thanks again for all your support and patience through this new venture!



Hey folks!

Just a few quick updates on the Infragram Point & Shoot. We are running a little bit behind schedule as we had to work out a few kinks with the prototype and figure out SD cards and new packaging. You will be happy to know that we have finally placed the bulk order for 500 pre-modded Mobius cameras today. We are hoping to have these getting out and in the mail to you by mid July and have all Kickstarter orders fulfilled by the end of that of that month.
 
If you didn't sign up for a Point & Shoot, [pre-orders are open](http://store.publiclab.org/collections/diy-infrared-photography) and will ship shortly after the Kickstarter rewards.

###Software 

In the meantime, based on [ongoing collaborative research](http://publiclab.org/tag/mobius) at [PublicLab.org](http://publiclab.org), we have improved the Infragram.org web-based processing software to make analyzing your photos much easier and more intuitive. The interface comes with presets for different kinds of cameras (including the new Point & Shoot), and is more compact and mobile-friendly. Give it a spin at http://infragram.org or get involved in improving this open source project at https://github.com/p-v-o-s/infragram-js

Thanks for your support!
