##**Specials on kits including Spectrometers, Filters, and Balloon Kits**
It's that time of the year and the season of giving is in full swing here at Public Lab. Right now we are giving the gift of open source science with additional savings on DIY environmental monitoring tools. Our injection molded, rigid, plastic, one of a kind Smartphone Spectrometer is on sale for $40. This handy little device quickly and easily assembles to attach to your smartphone's camera turning it into a mobile spectrometer. The perfect gift for a budding field scientist, student of molecular chemistry or for just bringing the family and friends together around the kitchen table or outside. (Coming soon, a Festivus Low Aerial Mapping Pole for the rest of us.)

Use a homemade spectrometer to scan different materials and capture a substance's spectral "bands of light" signature. Our DIY Spectrometers make it easy to capture and observe the spectra on your phone of many unknowns substances (like Grandpa's Secret Eggnog Delight). Host a spirited spectral showdown to explore your favorite holiday warming liquor. The applications are endless.

##**Holiday Lights Spectral Spectacle**
**Foldable Festivities**

This easy to assemble foldable mini-spectrometer is a long running staple at Public Lab. This new year we are planning a redesign to move toward a more easily mass produced model, so all remaining stock must go!

Regularly $10, all remaining stock of precision laser cut models discounted to $5. These flat kits ship first-class letter rate and are a great stocking stuffer.

**Infragram Wonderland**

An "infrablue" filter can turn your webcam or point-and-shoot into a winter wonderland of "multispectral" beauty. Measure photosynthetic activity in the holiday tree or those lovely rhododendrons mom loves; read about the technique at http://publiclab.org/wiki/near-infrared-camera and http://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram.

With the new year comes new kits, and we will be relaunching the Infragram Filter Pack with some different features. Now this is the last chance to get packs which include the Roscoe Blue #74. Close out pricing on the "Infrablue" filter packs has been reduced to $5!
