###What I want to do
Demonstrate the effectiveness of Public Laboratory staff and volunteers to appear on variety television programs speaking about Public Laboratory.

###My attempt and results
Fortunately, RAI TV asked us to do precisely that in 2013 for its variety television show Ubiq.

The episode can be found online here (requires Silverlight player?): http://www.rai.tv/dl/RaiTV/programmi/media/ContentItem-7b2baf7d-da81-47a8-8f6f-8fe7890ae753.html

Interviewed in the video are:

* [Jeffrey Warren](/profile/warren)
* [Bryan Bonvallet](/profile/btbonval)
* [Stefan Unterhauser](/profile/nemo)
* [Dorn Cox](/profile/dorncox)

Also spotted in the video:

* [Chris Fastie](/profile/cfastie)
* [Karen Vale](/profile/karenv)

Actually, I needed some screen caps, so I figured I'd share via a research note while I was at it.

strikethrough Unfortunately, Silverlight is pretty much Microsoft only. I don't have anything to play the video or do screen caps until I get my desktop up and running. /strikethrough It looks like I can watch this video on Linux now, and I was able to download the original .mp4 by inspecting the DOM.

###Questions and next steps
What were we saying? Our voices were dubbed over with smooth Italian.

Perhaps as a next step, someone fluent in Italian might translate our dialog.

I'd also like to get some screen caps sometime.

###Why I'm interested
Trying to find images of me doing public labby things for organizer reasons.
