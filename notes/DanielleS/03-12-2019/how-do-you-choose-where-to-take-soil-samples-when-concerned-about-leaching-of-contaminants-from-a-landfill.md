How can you pick where
to sample so that you can see and say whether the contamination is coming from
the landfill or some other source? What kind of contaminants - in the soil- are
you concerned about from a landfill? Have you used soil contaminant tests to
help with ensuring a landfill complies with environmental  and human
health regulations?
