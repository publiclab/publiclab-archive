**How to test soil for
OIL & GAS contaminants**

---------

Many communities in
Texas and throughout the Gulf are facing oil and gas industry related
contamination of their neighborhood soils and waterways. Petroleum
products have the greatest risk for human health when they are in drinking
water. But because many petroleum hydrocarbons are highly mobile, if they are
in soil they can be easily transported to water resources. 

Several petroleum hydrocarbons like benzene,
toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene can cause cancer. Humans can also be exposed
to petroleum hydrocarbons by inhaling the fumes from contaminated soil.
Alternatively, humans can ingest contaminated soil, which can be a primary
pathway in children. Despite some individual petroleum hydrocarbons being
carcinogenic at low levels and continued exposure, even at low levels, creates
a risk for health problems for children and adults alike. 

Read more about petroleum products in soils here: [https://www.soils.org/discover-soils/soils-in-the-city/soil-contaminants/petroleum-products](https://www.soils.org/discover-soils/soils-in-the-city/soil-contaminants/petroleum-products) 

**What are petroleum hydrocarbons?**  

Petroleum products,
such as gasoline, diesel, and heavy fuel oils, originally come from crude oil
and consist of complex mixtures of hundreds of compounds, of which petroleum
hydrocarbons are one of the main components. Read more about these soil
contaminants in the Soil Contamination Wiki ([https://publiclab.org/wiki/soil](https://publiclab.org/wiki/soil "https://publiclab.org/wiki/soil")). Because
of the widespread use of these products, environmental contamination from
petroleum hydrocarbons is common. Alongside busy roads, your driveway or parking
area, near any kind of oil or gas storage tank, and generally areas that are near
auto-shops, gas stations, refineries, or have been flooded may have petroleum
hydrocarbons.

**Where to sample for petroleum hydrocarbons**

When released to the
environment, petroleum products change due to weathering (the breakdown of its
components by light, heat, microorganisms), which causes changes in the how
they move around and where they end up. Heavily oil contaminated soils have an
obvious darker or gray color and a notable petroleum smell. You get to play ecological
detective a bit to choose good locations for sampling.

Hydrocarbons with
similar physical and chemical properties can be assigned to a specific
equivalent carbon range, known as fractions. Some petroleum constituents
biodegrade more readily, like the 'BTEX' -- lighter fuels- leaving the relatively
non-mobile components (the heavier components like diesel or crude oils) at the
original location (ATSDR, 1999). The constituents that biodegrade quickly or
volatilize in the vapor phase, though they are of immediate concern after a
spill to nearby humans- are less of a concern over the long term than the
heavier petroleum products that stick around in the soil and are more likely to
impact ecological populations.

\_When you are taking soil samples for petroleum hydrocarbons, protect
yourself from exposure to harmful chemicals by wearing gloves and possibly a
mask. \_

\*\*How to analyze soils
for Petroleum Hydrocarbons \*\*

---------

Most of the time, people
take soil samples to a professional lab for analysis, but this is costly- $200-300
to get one single sample analyzed for PAH's and PCB's, two common petroleum
hydrocarbon contaminants in soils. You can also just test for "total petroleum
hydrocarbons" (TPH). TPH represents the total level of hydrocarbons rather than
the identification of individual components (such as PAH's, toluene, PCB's).
This gives you a general sense of whether there are significant levels of
petroleum hydrocarbons worthy of investigating more but does not give you specificity.
Having one sample analyzed for one or two specific contaminants is not going to
give you a good picture of what levels and types of soil contaminants present
in your soil, because you are just looking at one spot. The more samples you
can do, spread out over your site and at different depths, and the more
specificity of what types of petroleum hydrocarbons are present, the better.

If you are sending
the samples to a professional lab to be analyzed, because they are organic and some
of them can change- volatilize (evaporate in the air) or degrade (break down in
light and warmer temperatures)- the samples need to be filled to the very top (no
airspace) of glass jars that are ideally dark, kept on ice, and delivered to
the lab within 24 hours so that the measurement isn't thrown off.

So for communities wanting
to monitor their soil for oil and gas industry related pollution, there's a
need to find approaches to doing so that are more affordable and logistically
easier, while still giving accurate and reputable results (in case you will use
the soil contaminant data to hold an industry accountable). A range of scientific literature related to oil and
gas monitoring has been [collected on this Public
Lab page](https://publiclab.org/wiki/oil-testing-kit-literature).

\*\*Field Colorimetry
and Reagent-based Approaches to Analyzing Soil Petroleum Hydrocarbons \*\*

There are many
commercially available field test kits for soil petroleum hydrocarbon testing
that offer an alternative to sending samples to a lab for analysis. These field
test kits use chemical reactions to help to identify contaminants, both
qualitatively and quantitatively.

**_A reagent-based
approach_** involves using a
solvent to extract contaminants from soils, then a reagent is added which
causes a chemical reaction in response to specific compounds. The reaction
produces a color which indicates the presence of the target compound, and the
intensity of the color produced can be compared with the color of standards of known
concentrations.

\*\*\_A colorimetric
reaction \_\*\*measures color or
turbidity in response to the presence of the contaminant and the resulting
color is compared to a color chart or is measured using a photometer.

Here are some examples
of commercially available reagent-based kits:

- The Hanby Field Test Kit - petroleum products
and PCBs in soil and water
- The Clor-N-Oil and Clor-N-Soil kits -
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in soil and oil
- The Dexsil L2000DX analyzer - chlorinated
organics in soil, water, dielectric fluids, and surface wipes.
- The PetroFLAG(tm)- total petroleum hydrocarbons
(TPH) in soil
- SiteLab(r) - aromatic compounds derived from
petroleum based fuels in soil, sediment, and water.
- The SDI Quick ![checkmark](file:///C:/Users/Danielle/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip\_image001.gif) - total
Volatile Organic Halides (VOHs) in soil and water
- AQR Color-Tec(r): total VOHs in soil and water

There are advantages
to using test kits in the field, including:

- speed (results in
minutes)
- portability (can
bring out to various sites)
- low cost per
sample ($20-25/sample as compared to $80-200/sample as through a lab)
- the range of
contaminants that can be analyzed (PAH's, PCB's, different types of oil, gas
and pesticides).

After learning the
technique, a beginner can immediately begin to use some of the simpler tests.
The challenge with these approaches are that they typically involve the purchase
of the field test kit, which can range from $850-1250 USD. This may be within a
feasible range for a community group to purchase upfront and use for ongoing
soil monitoring at multiple sites.

At the Texas
Barnraising, we had a demo from Hanby and got to use their soil petroleum kits
to analyze soils. Read about how here: (ADD LINK)

\*Although some field
test kits are based on EPA methods used for reference and produce equivalent
results (such as the Hanby kit), many kits are screening analytical methods,
which means that the impact of potentially significant analytical
interferences, imprecision, and bias need to be considered when interpreting
kit responses, and comparing the results to results from other analytical
procedures.

In development are
several DIY methods using reagents, colorimetry, and spectrophotometry to
detect soil contaminants. Please comment
if you have experience with this!

For example, a
number of analytical measurement assays have already been developed and
documented with the [open source colorimeter](http://www.iorodeo.com/collections/open-source-colorimeter), including assays for measuring
iron, nitrate, potassium and more. However there are still many more analytical
measurements that can be carried out using this very simple and cheap
measurement device, including a range of heavy metals and hopefully, pesticides.
