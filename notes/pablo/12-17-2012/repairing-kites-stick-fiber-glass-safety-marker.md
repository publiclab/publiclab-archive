One of the sticks of the kite was broken, so we substitute it with a fiber glass safety marker 72", <a href="http://www.sears.com/hy-ko-prod-6'-orange-safety-marker-by/p-SPM6451897907P">like this one</a>, that Jeff Warren had given me.
It was easy to cut it with a saw, and to give its shape to make it fit in the kite. 
Thanks Daniel!
