Hi All - does anyone have any experience with air quality monitoring, particularly for the types of pollutants being produced by oil/gas refineries.  We have this semi-regular thing happening in our neighborhood where there is a strong sulfur odor.  I suspect it's from one of the area plants. 

  
What I am interested to do is to set up - DIY style - a routine outdoor air quality monitor, that can help better understand the types of pollutants in the air - particularly the type that come from a refinery.  If it could post stats similar to the particulate sensors like PurpleAir.

  
Thanks in advance!
