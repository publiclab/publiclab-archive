I am sorry for such a delay in posts, I recently got a sustainability internship and have been working a lot of hours there. Additionally, we deployed the Mobius Actioncam for a month and a half duration in a small town in Wisconsin, and just recently retrieved it. 


My research team and i decided that it would be best to change the location to a mine where blasting events have been taking place once a week up to a few times per week. The new deployment location has a clearer view of the mine, although the mine is located about 2 times further away from the camera. Although the mine is further away, there are no visual impediments that would hide blasting events, so hopes were high when we deployed the camera. We made sure that the camera was fully charged before we deployed it. We decided that the 2 minute interval time-lapse setting would be best for this location, and chose a slightly wider angle view than the standard lenses. 

We deployed the camera at 5:35 pm, and expected it to take photos for just under a week. ***FAST FORWARD A MONTH*** I picked up the camera from a friend of mine who is also on the research team to analyze the photos to see if the camera captured a blasting event, and found that the camera took photos from 5:35 pm to only 8:48 pm. To say am disappointed is an understatement, I had such high hopes of capturing a blasting event. I have been in contact with a person from Public Lab, and they have been generous to offer us a game camera to test out at our deployment location. Although I am disappointed that a month and a half has been lost with no data collected, I am hopeful that this new camera will yield better results.
