# Spam Management Dashboard

Spam Management is one of the most crucial features of an organization. It keeps the user feed reliable, interesting, and informative. Public Lab actively works on spam filtration and has a great team of moderators to take care of that. For their ease of spam moderation, a new spam moderation dashboard is introduced.

In my Google Summer of Code project, I redesigned the UI and added features like bulk moderation, flag, queue, insights, and filters.

For more details please refer to my [GSoC 2020 proposal](https://publiclab.org/notes/keshav_sethi0004/03-12-2020/gsoc-2020-proposal-spam-management-dashboard) and my [Planning Issue](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/7885 "https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/7885"). This will give you a basic idea about this project.

NOTE: **All my PRs are listed at last of this post** and for more detailed documentation click [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/keshav_sethi0004/08-18-2020/spam-management-dashboard-documentation)

# Spam2

Spam Management Dashboard is available on [https://publiclab.org/spam2](https://publiclab.org/spam2). Only Moderators and admins have access to it. The previous version of the spam management dashboard is available at [https://publiclab.org/spam](https://publiclab.org/spam).

[/spam2](https://publiclab.org/spam2) will redirect moderators to the bulk moderation page as shown below.

![image description](https://publiclab.org/i/40726.png "Screenshot_from_2020-08-30_00-03-38.png")

All the spammed and unmoderated Nodes are present along with filters and bulk moderation features. Spammed are marked with a red badge and unmoderated with a blue badge for easier identification.

At the top count of unmoderated and flagged nodes are also present. Moderator can also change node per page with dropdown at the left. By default, it is 30\. At the top and bottom of the table, page stats are also present shows the number of pages and total nodes.

All the navigation links related to spam2 are present in this menu and the current page will be highlighted with blue color. At the top of this menu, the role of the user is also present (Admin or Moderator). Contents of Menu are Insights | Moderation, Wiki, Queue, Revision, Comment, Flag, and User moderation

---------

# Bulk Moderation

There are in general five Bulk moderation buttons which are as follows:![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kpxq41p3-Dc2v1Tb8HXytKPBvqqaurOcptSsJO8dxv2e0EqgLKEkdSuFOUqnFiA-pUgAVaD1yIiEa3t9BnbBftSiFcvbE0Zx_Gct8I2EDGgKLvUoMK34A8WoSuLYrjgFzqvNg9MJ)

- Spam will mark nodes as spam(status: 0), ban its user(status: 0) and unflag that node(flag: 0).
- Publish will mark nodes as publish(status: 1) and unban its user(status: 1) and unflag that node(flag: 0).
- Delete will delete selected node permanently
- Ban will ban the authors of selected nodes
- Unban will unban the authors of selected nodes
- Unflag will unflag selected nodes (Flag section)

All the bulk moderation buttons are disabled until nodes are selected. If one or more than one node is selected then all the buttons will get activated.

The select button will select all the nodes and remove all the selections if pressed again.

Bulk moderation nav is fully responsive and has a horizontal scroll in mobile and tablet screen sizes.

---------

# Filters

Moderators can also filter nodes based on the following criteria:

- New activity: Sort nodes by their update time.
- Recent: Sort nodes by their creation time.
- Spammed: Filter by status '0' and its count is also displayed in the badge.
- Unmoderated: Filter by status '4'
- Published: Filter by status '1'
- Wiki: Filter by type 'wiki'(Present in Menu)
- Revision: Filter by the spammed revision(Present in Menu)![image description](https://publiclab.org/i/40727.png "Screenshot_from_2020-08-30_00-30-08.png")

The count of flag per node is shown in the Status column. In the action column, the moderator can unflag the node with an unflag button. This will change the count of the flag to 0\.

Moderators can filter flagged nodes as per their status(Unmoderated and spammed) and type(Note and wikis).
