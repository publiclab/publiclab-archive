#### Community Bonding -\> Week 3 Spam management Dashboard

I have updated and planned some of my milestones in the planning issue and added a few more tasks to make it more refined and clear.

Link to my planning issue: [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/7885](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/7885 "https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/7885")

I have started working on it and initiated this from UI improvements and then moved to bulk moderation features like bulk publish and bulk spam.

I have added all the features of the current spam management dashboard and made a PR for this.

Link to UI PR: [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/7928](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/7928)

Link to that issue: [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/7927](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/7927)

Next week I have planned to complete UI and make it responsive along with bulk moderation features and tests. I have also planned to start Digest this week.

Please comment below for any reviews and suggestions.

Thank you!!
