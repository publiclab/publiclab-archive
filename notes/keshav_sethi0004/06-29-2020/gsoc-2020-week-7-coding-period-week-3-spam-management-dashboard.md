On week-7 (Coding week-3) I worked on some UI improvements as previous UI was creating some issues in stable.publiclab.org and had a lot of CSS and design issues. Here I removed top nav and side nav and updated as shown in the following image.

You can find it in following PR [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8034](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8034 "https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8034")

There were also few issues in system tests which I updated this week in this PR [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8038](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/8038)

  
I also worked on weekly Digest [https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/7987](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/7987 "https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/7987")
