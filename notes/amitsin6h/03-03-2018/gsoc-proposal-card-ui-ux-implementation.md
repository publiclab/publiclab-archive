How all started after completing my my Class 12th. I first started to work with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jquery and Javascript and knew how to build website after this I moved to Android development as I got curious to know how android app runs in mobile and this made to learn android development and also made few apps. After this is I started to work with Python and its web development framework Django. I worked with Django for 5 months and I also created twitter like app but it was a beta version still it had lots of thing, but it had features like create profile, tweet and see other user profile. I also started to learn PHP and also worked with codeigniter. I also worked with MEAN.js fullstack development, I also recently wrote a tutorial for a community on "how to create todo app using mean.js" . I am just curious to know things and this keeps me to learn new things.

### Teamwork

Till the date I have participated in three hackathons from my area and with a team of 2-3\. In the first hackathon we came in Top 9 , second hackathon 4th and on the third hackathon we came first and this shows the teamwork.

As I said, I also work with other open source communities and we know whats the importance of teamwork.

### Passion

Public Labs has been very active, supporting community from my end. Public Lab has motivated me to write a GSoC Proposal for this summer. I see Pub Lab is great place to learn open source contribution. The best thing about being an Open source enthusiast it helps you connect and learn with new people.

### Commitment

I understand that this is a serious commitment and assure you that I will complete the work, also once am done with the card design. I would like to work with frontend side of the Public Lab website hope to bring a great look and feel to the website.
