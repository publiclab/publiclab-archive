Nice instructions.  
On my old cdrom, it was impossible just to scratch and peel.  
The solution was to stick gaffer tape to it and then rip off the layers. Repeat until all silver is gone!  
  
Alcohol and isopropanol are ineffective, acetone melts the plastic so you lose the diffraction grating, and microwave ovens, contrary to some views, just leave a nasty crazed pattern
