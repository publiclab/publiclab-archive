# Help with infragram on custom camera, red/yellow/green appears to be backwards?

![image description][1]

I've modified a Panasonic DMC-LZ5 digital camera to take photos for use in creating an infragram. I've removed the filter, and installed a red filter in its place inside the camera (filter material is Rosco E-Colour #019: Fire). Also, did the custom white balancing using the instructions by setting on a bright red object in direct sun.

The photos appear slightly turquoise as suggested they should be (perhaps not as turquoise as they should be), however, when I generate the infragram using the public labs website, I get the image as shown above.  (the flower in the photo is actually a reddish/magenta color, so maybe my subject should've been a white flower)

In the original photo (top), you can see a shadow just under the flower in the photo, however in the infragram it shows more yellow than the surrounding area. Doesn't this imply more photosynthesis than the surrounding area? And shouldn't a shaded area be experiencing less photosynthesis? I also see this in the other photos, where the sun exposed areas are green, and the shaded areas in the depths of the plant foliage tend to be yellow or even red as in the processed image!

I've tried messing with the white balance with different reds. Also the histogram shown seems to have good separation between the red and blue channels, so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.

Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated. I've been scouring the website and pulling my hair out on this!

I've also tried a Raspberry Pi Noir camera with the same filter, and it seems to produce more appropriate images, so I'm wondering if I have some setting wrong, or there is just something inappropriate with the panasonic camera sensor I'm using.
