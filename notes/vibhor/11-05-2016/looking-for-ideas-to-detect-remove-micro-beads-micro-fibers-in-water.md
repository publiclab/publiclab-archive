###What I want to do or know
Ideas to detect or remove micro plastics from household used water from sinks, washning machines
###Background story
Working with a group of 6-7th graders on a project on ocean pollution. We are fascinated by the challenge to micro plastics flooding the oceans. We are looking to prototype a sensor to detect/measure volume of such particles from a load of wash. What sensors could we try to test/use for this purpose?

Thanks
