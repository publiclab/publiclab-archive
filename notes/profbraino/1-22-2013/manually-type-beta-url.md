finally got rainbow to display by manually typing URL for beta capture. 
drop down does not function on nexus 10, so I had to navigate on PC and manually type URL.  OK. so I got that far.  still cannot get calibration to display anything. 

maybe this is only intended To work on apple products?  too bad, I thought this would be useful.
