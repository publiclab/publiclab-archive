### Outreachy Winter 2022[]()
We are participating in the Outreachy winter 2022 round.

> Outreachy's goal is to increase diversity in open source.

We're  hereby asking applicants to start posting their proposals for reviews, suggestions and comments from mentors and our community at large, here. Read on!

### Deadline: [](https://publiclab.org/notes/cess/10-24-2022/call-for-proposals-outreachy-winter-2022-round#Deadline)

 Outreachy applications will be close on Fri Nov 4, at 4pm UTC

### Project[](https://publiclab.org/notes/cess/10-24-2022/call-for-proposals-outreachy-winter-2022-round#Project)
We have one project this round:
- [Improve MapKnitter Lite for mapmaking with aerial photos as a lightweight web service](https://www.outreachy.org/outreachy-december-2022-internship-round/communities/public-lab/#improve-mapknitter-lite-for-mapmaking-with-aerial-)

Hopefully you have already found the github discussion of the project [here](https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/issues/1130) and the overall discussion issue [here](https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/issues/1131) 

** A little disclaimer** :
Our mentors are a little stretched this round - it may be hard for our few mentors to go through all the proposals and provide feedback in time or at all. Please be patient and feel free to review each others proposals, and refine your own proposal before you post the final draft on the Outreachy website. We do encourage applicants to write a proposal regardless : it gives the mentors a better way to understand you, your plan and for you to better articulate the project.

**Kindly note you still have to submit the final proposal on the Outreachy website and record your contributions there, before the deadline to be considered.**

### Read proposal ideas [](https://publiclab.org/notes/cess/10-24-2022/call-for-proposals-outreachy-winter-2022-round#Read+proposal+ideas)

Read this page carefully to understand our workflow and how we structure internship projects: [https://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc#How+we+work](https://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc#How+we+work)

Please ask questions! We're very friendly and we love welcoming new people into our community.

### Post a proposal for comment [](https://publiclab.org/notes/cess/10-24-2022/call-for-proposals-outreachy-winter-2022-round#Post+a+proposal+for+comment)

Once you've read the project idea and become a bit more familiar with the project, it's time to post a proposal of your own.

You don't need to have a complete or even concrete idea -- share your thoughts and we'll help you refine your proposal, and help you choose something that's the right difficulty level as well as being something our project really needs. 

We've created a template for you to post a proposal here. Click here to begin:
