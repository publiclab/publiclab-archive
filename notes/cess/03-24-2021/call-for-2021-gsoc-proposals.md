### Google Summer of Code 2021

We've done GSoC for a few years now ([read more here!](/gsoc)), and we especially welcome contributions from people from groups underrepresented in free and open source software! GSoC explains:

> As a part of Google Summer of Code, student participants are paired with a mentor from the participating organizations, gaining exposure to real-world software development and techniques. Students have the opportunity to spend the break between their school semesters earning a stipend while working in areas related to their interests.

So, we're asking students to start posting their proposals for comment, here. Read on!

### [Deadline](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/02-28-2019/call-for-summer-of-code-2019-proposals#Deadlines)

GSoC applications will be close on April 13, 2021.
