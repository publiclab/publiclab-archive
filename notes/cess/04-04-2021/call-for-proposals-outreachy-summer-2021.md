### Outreachy Summer 2021 [](https://publiclab.org/notes/cess/04-03-2021/call-for-proposals-outreachy-summer-2021)

We are participating in Outreachy summer program 2021. Outreachy internships are 3 months long. Interns are paid an internship stipend of $6,000 USD. 
Interns work with experienced mentors from open source communities. 

We've done Outreachy for a 4 years now. Outreachy explains that:-

> Anyone who faces under-representation, systemic bias, or discrimination in the technology industry of their country is invited to apply.


So, we're asking applicants to start posting their proposals for comment, here. Read on!
