### Google Summer of Code  [](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/02-28-2019/call-for-summer-of-code-2019-proposals#Outreachy+and+GSoC)

This year we're participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (#GSoC) under [DIAL](https://hub.osc.dial.community/) -- GSoC recruits students minorities to work on open source projects.

We've done GSoC for a few years now. Gsoc explains:

> Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school.

So, we're asking students to start posting their proposals for comment, here. Read on!

### Deadline: [](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/02-28-2019/call-for-summer-of-code-2019-proposals#Deadlines)

 GSoC applications will be close on March 31, 2020\.
