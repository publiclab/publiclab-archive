You don't need to have a complete or even concrete idea -- share your thoughts early and we'll help you refine your proposal, and help you choose something that's the right difficulty level as well as being something our project really needs.

We've created a template for you to post a proposal here. *Please note:the format for proposal is a little different for GSoC this year, please feel free to format the template to the new format.*  
Before you get started because of a  common question often asked  - **you will still have to post the pdf proposal on the Google Summer of Code website for you to be eligible for the internship selection**
