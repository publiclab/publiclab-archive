Hi everyone,

An opportunity has come up to do a balloon mapping day with Hester Street Collaborative on May 4th. It is part of the HSC Waterfront Community Day! http://pathstopier42.com/2013/04/22/waterfront-community-day/
Please let me know if you are interested and can come so we can plan on a place to meet and also how we can share resources to make this a really cool balloon mapping experience. 

Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you!

Veronica Acosta
