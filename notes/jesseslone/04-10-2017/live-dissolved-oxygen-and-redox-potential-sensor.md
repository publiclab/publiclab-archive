I'm using a variety of hardware, not all of which is open-source (my design is, but not the products themselves), to create a live feed on [io.adafruit.com](http://io.adafruit.com). You can view the feed at the following URL: [https://io.adafruit.com/jesseslone/dashboards/water-quality-sensor](https://io.adafruit.com/jesseslone/dashboards/water-quality-sensor)

# Overview

I am currently using a NodeMCU board based on the ESP8266, but I will be transferring the project over to Adafruit's feather ecosystem to take advantage of some additional wireless options. The ESP8266 has some impressive capabilities, like an onboard SSD that can be used for data logging, so that connectivity issues don't disrupt your data, etc. It also has a sleep mode, as do the Atlas Scientific boards, that could allow the device to run for at least a month on a rechargeable battery. The code is terrible in its current state, as there are currently no libraries for the Atlas Scientific boards that utilize their I2C capabilities.

These sensors are in a small wastewater treatment system. The test system does not discharge into waterways, and the treated water is used for landscaping irrigation. I'm trying to find a way to model what is referred to as BOD or biochemical oxygen demand (basically quantify the volume of biological waste) based on how the treatment volume responds to certain events, such as aeration. With that information, treatment parameters can be adjusted to reduce the release of ammonia and other compounds into waterways.

As a side benefit, constant monitoring can reduce pollution events by timely notification of mechanical failures. The next step is adding a feed that indicates when aeration starts and stops so that the data will make a little more sense.

# Dashboard

Let me discuss what you see on the current dashboard and then cover what I used to make the setup work.![image description](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/020/113/large/Screen_Shot_2017-04-09_at_10.16.13_PM.png "Screen_Shot_2017-04-09_at_10.16.13_PM.png")

The first thing you see is shown above, a few guages to show what the current readings are from the sensors. ORP is a measurement of the voltage potential in a solution. Oxidation and reduction reactions in a solution either absorb or release electrons. This leaves the solution with a surplus or deficit of electrons, which is measured with the ORP probe. Interestingly, the ORP state of wastewater gives a generally good indication of the bacterial activity that is happening. I'll post some more research later, but my understanding is that the DO and ORP readings above would indicate that the wastewater is likely to produce fillamentous bacterial growth, which is generally bad. Also, it is wasting energy in the aeration process. In this case, the business that uses this treatement plant is closed on the weekend, so there is no waste added, and the bacteria have consumed most of the available waste in the system.

After the guages, you can see a normalized graph that shows the all of the readings, scaled so they will all be visible. It goes back 7 days, and makes it pretty clear when the sensor setup failed to upload readings for about a day. Also, at the beginning of the feed, you can see where I was getting the sensors calibrated.![image description](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/020/115/large/Screen_Shot_2017-04-09_at_10.57.56_PM.png "Screen_Shot_2017-04-09_at_10.57.56_PM.png")

The last part is a running four hour graph of the DO and the ORP sensor. You can see on this graph that the readings do not always have a clear correlation. I plan on getting more data to determine what affects the ORP sensor.![image description](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/020/114/large/Screen_Shot_2017-04-09_at_10.16.45_PM.png "Screen_Shot_2017-04-09_at_10.16.45_PM.png")

# How it's Made

The materials that I am currently using:

- NodeMCU ESP8266 development board
- Solderless Breadboard
- An old oudoor control panel we had on hand
- DS18B20 temperature sensor
- Atlas Scientific DO kit
- Atlas Scientific ORP kit

Here is the Fritzing diagram:![image description](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/020/116/large/ShopSensorBoard_bb.png "ShopSensorBoard_bb.png")

The code is hacked together from the example code from Atlas Scientific along with code from Adafruit. The Atlas Scientific code was designed to use an Arduino as an interface via serial console, so I ended up hard coding the "R" that is sent to get a reading into the I2C code samples and pushing the results to AdafruitIO. It works, but it is not pretty:
