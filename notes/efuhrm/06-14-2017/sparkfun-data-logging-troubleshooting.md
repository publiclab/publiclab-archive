I am looking for troubleshooting resources for the data logging platform Sparkfun. I have a Dylos 1100 air quality monitor connected to it using an "[\[open pipe kit\]](https://github.com/openpipekit)" from GitHub. The instrument works fine, but there is something wrong with the software that prevents the instrument from communicating with the web interface. I'm an exposure scientist by training and have little experience with writing or editing software. Any help or direction would be appreciated!
