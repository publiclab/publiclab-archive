Hi all!

  
I'm thinking of getting one of the kits, but would like to use it for emission spectrometry (in particular, measuring the emissions spectra of RGB LEDs for some color-mixing, sensory art projects.

  
Of course, that would require some modification of the kit (for example, don't need the cuvettes), but for those of you who have it, do you think the mods would be pretty forward, or not worth the trouble?
