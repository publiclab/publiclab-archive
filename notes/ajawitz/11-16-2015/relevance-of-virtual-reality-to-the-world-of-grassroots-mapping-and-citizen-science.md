###Why I'm interested
  I've been hearing about Virtual Reality since the "Lawnmower Man" days of the 1990s, and up until about a week ago my view of it as an expensive toy for rich people remained consistent.  Then I belatedly discovered something introduced over a year ago by Google that, if I didnt know better, I could've easily been convinced came straight out of the PublicLab Store!  [Google Cardboard](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/) is such a simple approach to high-end technology that I actually thought it was an April Fools joke when first introduced (I.e Google Cardboard as competitor to Amazon Cardboard piling up in the recycling bin...).  Cardboard VR was initially a simple stereoscope through which 3D imagery was produced by a smartphone. By making VR videos, games and map content  available as smartphone apps however, the "Cardboard View" is being promoted as common as viewing a window in full screen.
  After having been sufficiently impressed by the experience myself, I started thinking about new ways such an interface could be put to use.
  
####Back to the Future
  The first thought that occurred to me was how VR really is just a return to the old stereoscopic photography used throughout the 19th Century and in the 20th Century for aerial reconnaisance.  As a firm believer that field research should always be backed up with equally robust archival work (see notes titled [DIY Document Scanning](https://publiclab.org/notes/ajawitz/06-10-2015/diy-document-scanning) and [DIY Time Machine](https://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/10-07-2013/diy-time-machine) for examples) it occurred to me that VR could be used to extract much more information from historic imagery, especially when many early photos were meant to be viewed in 3D in the first place!
  While many may be imagining hand tinted portraits of dead Civil War soldiers when they think of sterescopes, 3D rendering was just as popular a method for capturing panoramas.  As in this image of SF from 1851-
[![Panoramic_San_Francisco_from_Rincon_Hill_c.1851.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/762/medium/Panoramic_San_Francisco_from_Rincon_Hill_c.1851.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/012/762/original/Panoramic_San_Francisco_from_Rincon_Hill_c.1851.jpg)

  One could certainly understand why it would be impossible to appreciate his panorama of the CIncinatti riverfront from 2 dimensions-

  This was especially true in early aerial photography where sophisticated Kite and Balloon Mapping rigs had to be capable of lifting heavy  panoramic cameras.
  This 1860 photograph of downtown Boston, for example, is actually considered to be the first aerial photograph in history!

  The usage of stereoscopic photogrammetry to interpret aerial imagery was developed [by the British in WW1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_reconnaissance_in_World_War_I) and was famously used in WW2 in [Operation Crossbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5tuZ05g-o) resulting in literally millions of prints of which only a fraction have been digitized.

  With aerial imagery becoming more and more accessible, contemporary usage of [stereoscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy) in the production of aerial images is becoming a frequent issue of discussion.  The USGS for example [provides stereo pair images](http://www.usgs.gov/faq/categories/9802/2993) by request.
  Discussions about stereoscopy and photogrammetry are certainly familiar in PublicLab circles and a [Stereo Camera rig ](https://publiclab.org/wiki/stereo-camera) has undergone various iterations in the PublicLab community since first introduced 3 years ago.  Meanwhile, Mapknitter and OpenDroneMap have been incorporating 3D elements into their respective platforms.

###Questions and next steps
  Does the democratization of Virtual Reality interfaces have any potential application to the field of citizen science?  Would widespread adoption have any affect on current grassroots mapping methods?  Would further development of a stereo camera help produce 3D mapping imagery?  What new insights could be gained by viewing current aerial imagery in 3D?

 Please do feel free to reply in the comments thread or via discussion forum.

###Updates
  The NYPL has a great tool called [Stereogranimator](http://stereo.nypl.org/) which allows users to create 3D viewable content using their collections!

  Another reader pointed out an app released by Google encouraging use of VR as a teaching tool- https://www.google.com/edu/expeditions/
