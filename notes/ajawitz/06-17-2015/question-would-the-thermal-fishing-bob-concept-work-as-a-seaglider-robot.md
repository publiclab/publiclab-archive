###What I want to do or know
  I want to know if the Thermal Fishing Bob concept could work as an Autonomous "SeaGlider" type robot.
###Background story
  A "SeaGlider" is a type of autonomous underwater vehicle that mimics a "porpoising" motion to propel itself through the water.  The method uses far less energy than a conventional propeller-driven method and is being researched for long endurance vehicles.

  An impressive, low-cost, DIY version called the[ SeaGlide](http://www.seaglide.net/about/) has been developed as a school curriculum by the same organization that sponsored the (far less impressive IMHO) "[Sea Perch](http://www.seaperch.org/index)" competition.  The web site at http://www.seaglide.net/ includes a full lesson plan, BOM,  3D printable part files and Arduino firmware.  All of which can be downloaded freely from this Dropbox-https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lattz1cupiqa6ai/AAD40WVk4Fu62y14ojnYm_D1a?dl=0  The fully functioning unit could be built for less than $100 depending on the availability of materials.

  The SeaGlide already includes a "Sensor Pod" with an Arduino, temp sensor, pressure and even an RGB LED to indicate the vehicles water depth.  So the vehicle could function in a manner similar to a Thermal Fishing Bob in its current configuration.  The only issue is whether or not the diving motion would make a long exposure image that accurately reflects water temperature too difficult to capture.  If it were possible to account for water temperature changes at different depths, then I imagine the diving motion would be an advantage, but I'm not sure how this would be accomplished.

  Of course, the advantages of such a low-cost, autonomous vehicle could make it appealing for a wide variety of uses beyond thermal imaging.  The arduino "sensor pod" allows for all kinds of device configurations...  
   I've wanted to build one myself for some time, but living as I do on the ocean, the vehicle is really more appropriate for rivers, ponds or other inland waterways where you could keep it from swimming away!
