###What I want to do or know
I would like to know if Infragram and a camera that has been modified for near-IR imagery can distinguish between Eelgrass and other Aquatic plant species.
###Background story
Marine Eelgrass ([_Zostera Marina_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zostera)) is a keystone and indicator species for coastal ecosystems in the coast of Maine.  Its defoliation as a result of invasive Green Crabs (_[Carcinus maenas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinus_maenas)_) is a key cause of acidification and other major threats to the entire marine ecosystem. By identifying Eelgrass in successive aerial surveys, scientists can measure its health or degradation as a key  indicator of the overall stability of the ecosystem.  Such a capability is currently only provided by costly sensors in manned overflights, the cost of which has limited such flights to once every two years and thus seriously limiting the usefullness of such data.  If Eelgrass can instead be identified using the IR-filter technique with Infragram software, access to such critical data would be opened up considerably!
