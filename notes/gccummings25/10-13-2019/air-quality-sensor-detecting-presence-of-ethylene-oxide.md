Some background to the research I'm trying to do: https://publiclab.org/notes/gccummings25/10-12-2019/ethylene-oxide-testing-covington-and-smyrna-ga

  
Can the [Public Lab air quality sensor](https://store.publiclab.org/products/simple-air-sensor?variant=14654995169389 "https://store.publiclab.org/products/simple-air-sensor?variant=14654995169389") be calibrated to detect ethylene oxide? I realize it has some shortcomings when it comes to data collection, but I would like for it to detect the presence of ethylene oxide. If it can't, what tool would you suggest?
