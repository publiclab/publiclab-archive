**Hello all, my name is Grace Kelley (nee Cummings) and I am a graduate student in communications design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY. I'm doing a project on environmental contamination with a focus on ethylene oxide contamination affecting the communities of Covington, GA and Smyrna, GA.**

  
Ethylene oxide is an odorless and slightly sweet-tasting gas that is used to sterilize medical equipment. [The EPA recognizes ethylene oxide as a cancer-causing toxin, and concluded in 2016 that ethylene oxide is 30 times more dangerous for humans than previously reported.](https://www.epa.gov/national-air-toxics-assessment "https://www.epa.gov/national-air-toxics-assessment") 

  
In April 2019, residents of Smyrna, GA learned that the Sterigenics sterilization plant put them at a higher cancer risk due to ethylene oxide emissions. In July 2019, residents of Covington, GA learned that the same thing was happening at the BD Bard sterilization plant in their city. According to [the WebMD article](https://www.webmd.com/special-reports/ethylene-oxide/20190719/residents-unaware-of-cancer-causing-toxin-in-air) that broke this news:

  
_Georgia has three affected census tracts, all in metro Atlanta -- two in the Smyrna area, and one in Covington where Ann Singley lived. The report estimated that around Smyrna, ethylene oxide causes about 70 of the 114 extra cases of cancer for every million people exposed over their lifetimes. In Covington, it estimated the gas causes about 170 of 214 cases for every million people exposed. The EPA considers the cancer risk from pollution to be unacceptable when it tops 100 cases for every million people who are exposed to a chemical over the course of their lifetime._

My mother-in-law lives in Covington, GA, and was diagnosed with cancer in 2009\. She was in remission until 2017, when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. She's still with us two years later, but other women I know from Covington have lost their cancer battles. And this issue is not confined to Georgia either--Willowbrook, Illinois is dealing with Sterigenics' ethylene oxide emissions, and communities in Pennsylvania, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Delaware, New Jersey have been affected as well.

  
The scope of my project is I need to collect primary data on ethylene oxide emissions in Covington and Smyrna. Hopefully, any data collected can be a drop in the bucket that empowers these communities to speak truth to power. It would be ideal if these data can contribute to classifying these communities as cancer clusters, but cancer clusters are so difficult to prove that that's unlikely.

  
However, I am out of practice collecting scientific data; I haven't done so since geology class in college in 2011\. I will need help collecting and interpreting data--is it even possible for a non-scientific grad student to independently test for ethylene oxide emissions? But one of the points I'm trying to make with my project is about the accessibility of science, that environmental activism isn't, and shouldn't be, exclusive to just the scientific community. I will elaborate in more specific research questions later, and link them here.

  
Thank you for your time and I'm excited to work with this community!
