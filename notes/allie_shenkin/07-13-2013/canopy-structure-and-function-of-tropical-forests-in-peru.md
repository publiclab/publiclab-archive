##What I want to do

Float a balloon over a number of 1-ha permanent forest plots along an elevation transect in Peru.  I plan to use point-and-shoots and Photoscan to derive 3-D scenes of the plot.  If possible, I would also like to float a FLIR IR camera over the plots.  I will float over a few points in each plot to have enough data to derive 3D scenes.

We will have LiDAR and T-LiDAR data for the plots as well, so this will be a good test case for the performance of DIY balloon-mapping methods in tropical forests.

##My attempt and results

pending.

##Questions and next steps

I have the balloon kit and a Canon SD870 with CHDK and an intervalometer script.  I've seen the instructions for the PET bottle camera rig.  I plan to use big trees and other landmarks for registration with LiDAR data.  Anything else to consider?
