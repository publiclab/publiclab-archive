We're planning experiments to compare various DIY methods for monitoring airborne hydrogen sulfide, including at least the silver photo paper method (described here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-sensor) and the copper rod method (described here: https://publiclab.org/notes/sharon-wilson/3-21-2012/copper-rod-test-h2s). I've been searching online, but am not having much luck finding information about the rates or mechanisms of the reactions of interest. Does anyone know of informational resources to find: 

  
1\. oxidation rates of hydrogen sulfide by oxygen versus reaction rates with elemental copper or monovalent silver?

2\. photo-reduction rates of silver chloride versus reaction rates of silver chloride with sulfide?

3\. oxidation rates of copper with oxygen versus sulfide?

  
Thanks!!
