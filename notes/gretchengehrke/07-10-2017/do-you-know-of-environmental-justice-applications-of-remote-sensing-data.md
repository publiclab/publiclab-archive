There are several sources of publicly available remote sensing data (such as those listed at www.publiclab.org/wiki/remote-sensing), and other satellite-generated data sets. Do you know of environmental justice applications for this type of data? Could publicly available remote sensing data be used alongside theoretical calculations of various sorts of fugitive emissions? Or demonstrate consistent and persistent flooding in areas cross-referenced with demographic census data? What are other ideas of how to leverage these datasets?
