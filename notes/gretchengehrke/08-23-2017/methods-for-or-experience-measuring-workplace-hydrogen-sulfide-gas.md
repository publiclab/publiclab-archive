I'm interested in comparing a variety of methods that are used for measuring hydrogen sulfide gas, ranging from NIOSH Method 6013 (which involves collecting an air sample into a sorbent tube, desorbing the sample, and analyzing using ion chromatography) to commercial sensors and tubes, to low-cost DIY methods. The type of monitoring I am most interested in learning more about right now is workplace monitoring for hydrogen sulfide. **Does anyone here have experience with on-site hydrogen sulfide monitoring? If so, what equipment did you use? How often did you monitor? Did you ever collect grab samples to be analyzed by an OSHA or NIOSH method?** Thanks!
