Humidity can have substantial impacts on several kinds of sensors and monitors of gaseous pollutants, such as particulate matter optical sensors, hydrogen sulfide corrosion sensors, and formaldehyde chemical reaction sensors. Particulate matter sensors are often near-real-time, generating a ton of data, but the low-cost hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde sensors we've been working on use an integrated 3-day to 30-day sample. What are good humidity sensors to use alongside these pollutant sensors to help make the pollutant sensor data more interpretable? 

Some thoughts that come to mind are: 
- able to record data over hours, days, or weeks 
- able to transmit data to a storage location or store data locally 
- stable in a variety of temperatures 
- outdoor weatherproofing (or able to have housing easily made for it) 
- inexpensive

Does anyone know of good, inexpensive humidity sensors commercially available? Or DIY ones that are simple to construct and use?
