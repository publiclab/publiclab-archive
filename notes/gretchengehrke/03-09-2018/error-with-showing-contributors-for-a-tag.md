### Please describe the problem (or idea)

I went to the page /wiki/microscope, and clicked on "contributors for this topic." The next page (of which I took a screenshot, but I don't know how to insert that into a question) says there are 25 contributors for the topic, but doesn't list them, and then further down the page also says there are no contributors for the topic.
