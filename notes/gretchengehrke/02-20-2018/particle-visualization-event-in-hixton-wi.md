## Event details

Public Lab is hosting an event to visualize airborne particles from frac sand mining using samples collected on properties next to the mine in Hixton.

**What**: DIY microscope visualization of airborne particles from frac sand mining and processing

**Where**: The Sedelbauer's farm; N8970 South Adams Road Hixton, WI 54635

**When**: 1pm - 3pm, Sunday March 4th

**Why**: This event will include a hands-on activity for a new technique that could be used in frac sand advocacy, and will include an open discussion to plan next steps. We'll learn about the specific issues faced by farmers adjacent to frac sand mines as the Sedelbauers will share their experience and what they've noticed with their animals.

Please spread the word and save the date! We look forward to seeing you in Hixton!
