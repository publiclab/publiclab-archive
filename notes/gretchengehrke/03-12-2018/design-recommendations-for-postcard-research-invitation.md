For the [SmART-Form project](/wiki/smart-form), we are going to do launch the new formaldehyde detection system as a community case study in southern Georgia. We'll be going door-to-door to invite people to participate in the study. About two weeks before we arrive, we will be mailing postcards to residents in the area, letting them know about the study and that we'll be knocking on their door soon. 

If you were to receive this postcard in the main (see the lead image), would you read it? Would you remember it? As compared to having received no word of the study, would receiving this postcard make you more or less likely to participate when we came to your door? 

What, if anything, would you change to make the postcard more appealing? It must be only black text (and I'll find a PL logo that doesn't have a white background), include the words "Research Opportunity" prominently, and provide contact info. 

Thanks for your feedback!
