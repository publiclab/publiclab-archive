Hi Folks, 

The FCC will likely be voting to repeal Net Neutrality on December 14th. The two main modes of civic engagement to protect Net Neutrality are to (1) contact Congress (who oversees the FCC) to remove or delay the scheduled vote, and (2) contact the FCC and tell them to NOT repeal Net Neutrality. There are also protests scheduled outside of Verizon stores (since the head of the FCC used to be a top lawyer for Verizon). 

Some resources for civic engagement are: 

1. Contact Congress: http://act.freepress.net/call/internet_nn_call_congress/ 

2. Contact FCC: http://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_wake_up_destroy 

3. Find a local protest: https://www.battleforthenet.com/ 


There are some great informational resources available about what Net Neutrality is, why it is important, the regulatory context of it, and political and social analyses of the current proposal:
