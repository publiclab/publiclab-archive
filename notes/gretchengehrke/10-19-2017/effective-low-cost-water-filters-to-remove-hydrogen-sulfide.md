Does anyone know of low-cost water filters that are effective for removing dissolved hydrogen sulfide? My inclination is to use biochar or granular activated carbon plus a coffee filter as a near-universal sorbent, but I am wondering if anyone knows of a material that is more effective at specifically sorbing H2S. I want to steer clear of oxidants due to resulting acidification of the water, especially since this is for people's drinking water in a community with aging water infrastructure. Please answer below if you know of good water filters for hydrogen sulfide!
