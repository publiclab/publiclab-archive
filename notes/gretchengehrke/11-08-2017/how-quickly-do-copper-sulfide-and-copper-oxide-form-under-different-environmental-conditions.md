What are the relative rates of copper sulfide formation and copper oxide formation under different environmental conditions? Humidity is known to accelerate the oxidation of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) to cupric oxide (CuO). Do different atmospheric concentrations of hydrogen sulfide impact the measurable rate of copper sulfide formation? How does formation of cuprous or cupric oxide impact any subsequent transformation to copper sulfide?
