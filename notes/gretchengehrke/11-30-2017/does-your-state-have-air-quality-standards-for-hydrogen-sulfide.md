I'm interested in how each state regulates hydrogen sulfide, both in terms of emissions and in terms of ambient and occupational exposure. I've started this wiki, discussing regulations federally and in six states (CO, MI, MN, PA, WI, TX):  https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-regulations. Do you know if your state has air quality standards for H2S? If so, please add them to the wiki!
