Hi, I get very dark images while using the spectrometer, so it seems not functioning correctly.

  
I also upgraded DVD grating with the upgrade from Public Lab ($10) it made no difference.

  
I pointed the spectrometer to the CFL bulb, and this is how it looks:

Also, it pretty much same when I point it to the sky.

  
The slit is the default one, I also ordered a set of slits, but the 0.4mm seems to be the same as the one in use. 

  
Any help is very welcome.
