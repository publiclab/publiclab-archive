## What I want to do

I'm trying to get a simple setup with the Riffle to measure electrical conductivity, and at this point I want to buy a commercial EC probe that is compatible with it.

## My attempt and results

I know that the Riffle supports the i2c and one-wire protocols, but I also know that it has limited memory and other hardware specs.

I tried searching online, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to find what I'm looking for. "I2c Electrical Conductivity probe" only returned one real lead: this probe and sensor board, which I may end up buying. https://www.atlas-scientific.com/product_pages/circuits/ezo_ec.html

## Questions and next steps

Will what I'm buying be compatible for the Riffle? How can I better search for compatible sensors that are supposedly relatively easy to find?

Next step questions for later:
* Waterproofing the apparatus
* Writing the code
* Adding a WiFi or other component to wirelessly retrieve data?

## Why I'm interested
I am working at an Environmental conservation camp this summer and would love to show kids what citizen science looks like. Road salt infiltration is a big issue in this area, and Paul Smith's college professors already do a lot about measuring conductivity in streams upstream and downstream of roadway runoff, and correlating that to household water quality, for instance.
