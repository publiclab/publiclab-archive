###Main question
What are the considerations needed and lessons learned for using the riffle in real world applications? Especially submerged in water?

###Background story
On an [open hour about waterquality last week](https://publiclab.org/wiki/openhour-archive), someone mentioned problems with re-using the same water bottle twice to house the riffle.

What are some other lessons learned, using this device in the field?
