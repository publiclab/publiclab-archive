# The question in general

How do you use readily available batteries with the Riffle?

# Background story

The current version of the Riffle (v1.18) usually ships with a 3.7 V rechargeable lithium battery with a JST connector, [like this one](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1781). But since lithium batteries may not be available everywhere, and are difficult to send through Air Mail, the Riffle was also designed to be compatible with any type of battery chemistry, as long as it uses a JST connector and is at the right voltage.

# Specific questions

What do you need to know to use other batteries with the Riffle?

- What are the voltage requirements: are there upper and lower limits?
- How many AA/AAA equivalent batteries do you need to use, and can those be rechargeable?
- Can commercial lithium rechargeable batteries [like these](https://www.amazon.com/EBL-18650-Performance-Rechargeable-Batteries/dp/B00IOCCDBK/) be charged from the Riffle's JST circuitry?
- How does JST work with conventional batteries? What are the easy methods and expert methods to attach JST connectors to batteries?
