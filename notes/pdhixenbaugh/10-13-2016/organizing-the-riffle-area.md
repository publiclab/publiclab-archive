###Context
@lizbarry and @donblair expressed interest in reorganizing the Riffle area. This is one outline for why and how that might be done. The more people that add their thoughts, the better! I'd also like to connect with people working in other areas of Public lab.

### Main Goal
*Give environmental investigators, riffle enthusiasts and riffle hackers the **entry points** and **organization** to connect better with others about the riffle*

### Organizational strategies
* Connect to *entry points* - places people hear about the riffle
* Use the Wiki as a focal point for organization
* Coordinate with maintainers of other areas: including open air (@nshapiro and others?) and spectronomy (@warren, @stoft and others?)

### Details

Work on the Riffle wiki

* Attention to navigation, readability, and expandability. Add introductions, explanations, and history. Link to other wiki pages when possible. Use good wikipedia pages as style references.
* "How to get a riffle" section: interest form for next order of riffles (google form) and call for activity: how to build a riffle from parts 
* Connect to related topcs: for example conductivity, turbidity, and temperature studies, using the riffle and using other methods
* 'Posts tagged "riffle" are also tagged with...'
* Connections to related water monitoring work outside public lab

Work on other pages

* Integration with entry points: research notes, riffle tag, and riffle search. 
* Path from home page to riffle (via tools, via open water) *(done)*
* Cultivation of tag-based organization -- adding tags to old posts, tag cleanup
 * Increase web of connections within riffle area: riffle development, riffle activities, riffle-beta, riffle-discussion, riffle & conductivity, riffle & temperature... (new riffle:powertag?... :p )
* Activities?
 * Start making new activities featuring the current and future riffles
 * Work on getting basic activity categories up, then think about... 
 * Bring past work with the riffles together in one place as "activities" - maybe as historical activities rather than to-be-replicated-exactly activities?

Other
* Get a better sense of who's using the riffle, developing the riffle, and waiting for the next riffle // what public lab's plans are for the future of the riffle // 

So what does YOUR future of the riffle area look like? What are your thoughts about organization within public lab?
