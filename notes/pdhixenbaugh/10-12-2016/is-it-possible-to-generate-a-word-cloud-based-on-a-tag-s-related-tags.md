###What I want to do or know

- Method to analyze tags on publiclab.org: tag cloud, frequency graph, etc., 

###Background story

I would like to explore the tags used in the riffle area, to see what connections exist to other topics, and what duplicate tags are used. I've seen tag clouds made in other places on publiclab.org. It may be over MY head, but how are people generating these tag clouds, and is it possible to make one that answers the question, for example, "Posts tagged "riffle" are also tagged ..." ranked by frequency?
