###What I want to do
Share Temp and Voltage Data from Riffle Test in a refridgerator for a week followed by room temperature for a week.

###My attempt and results

You can find raw data and charts on my github

###Questions and next steps

Can I test the Riffle in a freezer?

###Why I'm interested

I think this instrument might help measure WQ data in more streams / make it easier for people to monitor water quality, especially if it can be paired with a cell phone connection.
