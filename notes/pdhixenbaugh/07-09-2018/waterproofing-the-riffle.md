## What I want to do
Hi Y'all

Sorry about my disorganization. I am going to next investigate waterproofing a wire through a plastic bottle cap, in preparation for my Riffle Deployment. I have verrrry limited experience in this area. So, the two parts to this are:

1. How to make the hole through the cap (i'm guessing a drill...)
2. How to waterproof it (I'm guessing silicone sealant/goop)
3. Where else to look for information
...
âˆž. Write a guide for how to waterproof a container for a Riffle/ other sensor, emphasizing low-cost, high-waterproofing, and simple deployments with known assumptions about depth/wear, etc.


## My attempt and results

I used the public lab search to find stuff and I did find some links 
https://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/01-16-2015/sketching-a-waterproof-pop-bottle-sensor-system
* Uses a rubber stopper (bung? $0.40) for better waterproofing and interchangability, but also you have to get piping to put through the stopper, and aquarium-grade sealant to stop it up.

https://publiclab.org/notes/markwh/11-19-2014/waterproof-housing-for-arduino-conductivity-meter-part-2-results-and-other-containers
* found a lot of things that didn't work, but then seemed to find that a mason jar lid (on a plastic peanut butter jar container???) stayed watertight. So that might be worth investigating
* Ed Mallon suggested a ~$10 PVC enclosure technique.
* There is also a video with a method involving a toaster oven.

## Questions and next steps
* What else am I missing in my search
* Are there already guides to this / people who I can learn from?


## Why I'm interested
(I should really link my posts together -- teaching kids about how to ask scientific questions about their ecosystem health, and take measurements into their own hands.)
