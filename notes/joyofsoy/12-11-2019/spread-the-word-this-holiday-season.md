*In 2019, we’ve all been inspired by the young people taking a lead on climate action, and demanding a response from policy makers. To keep the momentum going, we have to make sure people are equipped with the tools they need to create a more just and equitable world.*

*That’s why I support Public Lab and its mission to educate and connect a new movement of scientists and advocates, so that all among us have a voice, the tools to collect data, and the power to protect and preserve our communities.*

*This holiday season, will you join me in [making a tax-deductible donation][6] or [donating a DIY science kit][7] to someone who might not be able to afford it?*
