FEB. 21, 2020 -- The Public Lab nonprofit is pleased to announce it has received a three-year award from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. "Through this generous backing, we're excited to build our capacity to model strong community/scientific partnerships, while demonstrating how science can support community goals and deepen informed civic engagement," said Shannon Dosemagen, executive director and co-founder of Public Lab.

With this award, Public Lab will prioritize:

- Supporting community leaders in addressing local environmental concerns with community science efforts
- Creating fellowships around the design and development of community science efforts
- Developing and running a training program on community science for educators

These funds will help support the organization's strategic goals through 2022: to make it easier for communities to lead scientific investigations through peer networking, education, and the use of open technology and data; to develop community leadership in science; and to build alliances with other like-minded organizations.
