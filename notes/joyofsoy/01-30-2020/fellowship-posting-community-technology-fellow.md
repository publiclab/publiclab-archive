**About Public Lab and the Fair Tech Collective**

Public Lab is a community, supported by a 501(c)(3) non-profit, that develops and applies open-source tools to environmental exploration and investigation. By democratizing inexpensive and accessible do-it-yourself techniques, Public Lab creates a collaborative network of practitioners who actively reimagine the human relationship with the environment.

The Fair Tech Collective, Professor Gwen Ottinger's research group at Drexel University, uses social science theory and methods to foster environmentally just science and technology.

**About the Fellowship**

This is a joint fellowship being offered by Public Lab and the Fair Tech Collective. In this project, the Fellow will do research to update and archive the [bucket air sampler](https://grist.org/article/the19/). The Fellow will also be responsible for writing and editing an updated technical and organizing manual for communities who want to use the bucket. To help ensure the sustainability of the bucket, the Fellow will identify labs that can provide reliable, affordable air sample analysis and communicate with stakeholders about the feasibility and organization of a potential network of bucket trainers. The Fellow will be co-supervised by Dr. Gwen Ottinger of the Fair Tech Collective and senior staff members of the Public Lab team.

**The major goals of this fellowship are to:**

1. Update and digitize the bucket manual: You will create a version of
the bucket manual that can be easily accessed online and published
in a run of hard copies for distribution. The updated manual will
include information and illustrations on building the sampling tool.
You will support the work of an illustrator and designer to complete
the bucket manual.
2. Set up the infrastructure for a distributed community of trainers: You will do an assessment of the current
landscape of Bucket Brigades and look at the feasibility of a
distributed network available to support people in using the bucket
tool and methodology to support community organizing activities.
3. Technical scoping: You will identify potential lab partners who will
be willing to analyze bucket samples pro bono or at a discounted
rate. You will support the Public Lab Kits Coordinator in
identifying and sourcing hardware components for the buckets.

**In the fellowship, your tasks will include:**

1. Doing interviews with members of existing and previous Bucket
Brigades.
2. Creating a revised and updated bucket air sampling manual.
The original version was created in the 1990s and was approximately
80 pages.
3. Developing a wiki page on [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org) that highlights
the bucket tool, process, and steps.
4. Writing research note
documentation on [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org) detailing your process, steps, and
highlights from your research.
5. Drafting a prospectus on potential
air sampling lab partners.
6. Drafting a concept for a trainer network
to support communities interested in using the bucket tool and
methodology. The concept will identify participants, resource needs,
and potential sources of funding.
7. Interacting with an advisory team
of 4-6 people and, when possible, meeting weekly with the Public Lab
and Fair Tech Collective team or providing written updates on
progress.
8. Maintaining and adhere to Public Lab [values](https://publiclab.org/wiki/public-lab-nonprofit-values), and the [Code
of Conduct](https://publiclab.org/conduct).

**The ideal candidate will:**

Have approximately 3-5 years of experience and/or have done work at a Masters level in, or fields related to, environmental studies and sciences, environmental engineering, or science and technology studies.

**This role may be for you if you are:**

- **Detail-oriented**: You have excellent documentation skills and are
often praised for your organization and attention to detail. An
exceptional written and oral communicator: You have excellent
interpersonal and interview skills, and you express yourself
effectively in genres ranging from email to proposals.
- **Team-oriented**: You work collaboratively, both in-person and with
remote colleagues, to envision and promote positive change, solve
problems, and to be supportive of others.
- **A helper who includes everyone**: You've worked with people with different backgrounds, and
different fields and experiences. You're able to communicate on
environmental science and monitoring in a way that's approachable and
understandable to newcomers.
- **Tech-savvy**: You thrive in an online environment. You are excited to learn new programs and share about technology and monitoring in the context of advocacy.
- **Self-directed**: You work successfully with minimal supervision. You can organize
work, set and meet your own internal milestones, and communicate when
help is required.
