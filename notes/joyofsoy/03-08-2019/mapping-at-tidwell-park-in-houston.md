Sunday at the Barnraising we went to Tidwell Park in Houston. The park is right by the community center and has active baseball and soccer fields, basketball courts, a playground, and a nature trail that runs alongside Halls Bayou. We spent some time balloon mapping, then a group went to do some soil testing along the banks of the bayou. Post on that soon to come!
