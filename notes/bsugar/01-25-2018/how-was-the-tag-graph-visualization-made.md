# How can I make a tag graph visualization?

Recently I have been asked a few questions about how the [tag graph](https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/09-15-2016/first-draft-of-tag-graph) was implemented. So I figured it might be good to have a public space to answer them!

Some preliminary questions:

1. If 2 tags belong to same node , they have an edge between them?
2. The different colors is for different types of node like questions , notes , research-notes , etc . ?

Please add any questions of your own and I'll hop back on to answer!

EDIT: I'll be posting more as soon as we can figure out where to place some files so they are publicly accessible.
