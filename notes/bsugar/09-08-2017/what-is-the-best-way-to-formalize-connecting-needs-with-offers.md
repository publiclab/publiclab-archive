After reading some of the conversations from the updates, I have some things I can provide.  Currently however, there doesn't appear to be a formal mechanism for the process.  
  
Seems to me a work flow might be required along the following lines:  
  

1. Needs described in meetings have to be translated to a posting.   
2. People need to be notified of needs postings.  
3. The 'needs posters" need to be notified that there is an offer to meet the need.
4. Directions need to be given regarding how to actually meet the need (where to send, for example).

Ideas:  

1. Perhaps a needs/offers wiki page with instructions that people can subscribe to?  However, this could really dissipate the centralization of the information.
2. Have each "ask" as a question which we can list on the main wikipage?
3. Have a tag to subscribe to specifically for needs so people can be notified as they come in?
4. Should people add questions as they find them about the wiki (Issue, the askers won't know it's been asked, the "wiki gardeners" won't know the details)  

Proposal:  Keep questions about needs embedded on the main response wiki page.  Add instructions to the [requests/offers](https://publiclab.org/wiki/harvey#Posting+asks+++offers) area on wiki page indicating that people should make requests through the question function and be sure to include the best way to connect the need with the offer (e.g. contact person), and that people use a given tag.  Indicate that interested parties can subscribe to the tag.

Outstanding question:  How can asks that come up during meetings be translated from ad hoc documentation to something that people can be notified about?
