Hi all,

I am the manager of the Forum program at the Museum of Science in Boston and a PhD student studying environmental health at Northeastern University.  Here is a google presentation describing some work I have been doing in Professor Sara Wylie's Community Based Participatory Research Course this summer.  As I say in the presentation, this work is very preliminary so I would be grateful for feedback or ideas.  

[The presentation can be viewed here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17612SjR53pO3ZLnqFf6cyg7o1fIgU9v8Gm3y7jsBOCI/present#slide=id.p14)

Thanks very much!
