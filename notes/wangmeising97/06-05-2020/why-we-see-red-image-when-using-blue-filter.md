I am using Pi NoIR camera with blue filter for my final year project on NDVI image analysis.

  
I get the concept of the blue filter will block the red light, while leaving most NIR in RED channel while Visible light will be captured in BLUE channel. 

  
However in this case when the red light is blocked by the blue filter, why the image will reddish in color?

  
I cant find any explanation, looking for help! Thanks

  
Below is the image taken by Pi NoIR camera with blue filter. ![image description](/i/39656.png "testAWB.png")

  
Here is my NDVI image taken in indoor environment under white led light. ![image description](/i/39657.png "ndvi_2020-6-4-2-54-29.png")

  
It cant really differentiate the background and the leaf. I have tried using different AWB settings. Any suggestion?
