###What I want to do
I was testing two different CFLs looking for differences in their spectra. Since I found that there are different CFLs, some closer to daylight than others.
###My attempt and results
I measured spectra of Sylvania Daylight F14T12/D fluorescence tube with

K-Lite FE-GU-14W bulb.

and here are they all together

###Questions and next steps
They seem to be clearly different. I am wondering which one should be the best to use for calibration? I think this is something that should be further researched. I found [this interesting note](https://publiclab.org/notes/dhaffnersr/02-04-2016/this-cfl-works-the-best) by @dhaffnersr suggesting one type of light 23W 2700K soft light works the best.
