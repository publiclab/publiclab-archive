###What I want to do
I want to find out the most effective and DIY friendly way how to collect and concentrate oil sheens from a water surface. I will be trying to test several new but also already existing accessible techniques that are non-toxic or otherwise harmful for the environment or living organisms. 
###My attempts and results
Since I will be testing several different techniques of oil water separation (OS), I will post attempts & results from each approach into a separate research note. All the notes will be linked under the OST (Oil Sheen Testing) tag and OS tag. In case there will be a new addition to a particular research note, I will post a direct link into the comments section.

#####Different Techniques of OS:
Magnetic Fluid Oil Separation
Centrifugal Oil Water Separator
Separation of Water and Oil by Freezing the Water
Membrane for Separating Oil and Water
Funnel Fuel Filter
Hydrophobic Fabric: FabricGore-Tex, Teflon Fabric, Natural Hydrophobic Coating for Textile
Hydrophobic Membrane
Bio Membranes (?)
Compressed Air OS
... and maybe more to come.

#####General Evaluation Technique: 
1. take triplicate spectra of oil 
2. take triplicate spectra of oil mixed with water (try starting with 1:20 oil:water dilution) 
3. run a separation technique 
4. take triplicate spectra of separated products (what we think is predominantly oil, and what we think is predominantly water) 
5. if spectra of initial oil is the same as the spectra of the separated oil (post mixing with water and separating), then repeat procedure with each oil type. 

#####Oils Products That Will Be Tested (so far):
20W50
05W30
80W90
North Dakota crude (Crude)
Dielectric Fluid from Con-Eddison (ConEd) 
Auto Diesel (AutoD)

###Questions and next steps
Main question is: What is the most effective, safe, clean, cheap, environmentally and user friendly way to separate oil from water?
And: What is the best way to collect the water?
#####Next steps:
I already started testing the "OS by Freezing Water". Please look for the a new separate research note dedicated to this technique. I will post it tomorrow.
- As I mentioned my goal is to test all of these techniques. 
###Why I'm interested
I am interested to test figure out a way how to prepare best specs for the OTK and to test the ability of different different DIY techniques to separate oil from water.
