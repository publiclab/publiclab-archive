# The Separation Essence Of Different Chromatography

According to the separation mechanism of substances, Chromatography can be divided into adsorption chromatography, distribution chromatography, ion exchange chromatography and the like.

The operation mode of the adsorption thin layer chromatography refers to that the adsorption capacity of the same adsorbent is different according to each component so that the mobile phase (solvent) flows through the stationary phase (adsorbent) continuously, and adsorption, desorption, and further are generated continuously. Adsorption, re-desorption, to achieve the purpose of separation of the components.

Partition Chromatography Commonly used in reverse phase silica gel thin layer chromatography and column chromatography of the packing system, the ordinary silica gel is chemically modified in the following manner, and the hydrocarbyl groups having different lengths are bonded to form a lipophilic surface.

The lipophilic sequence of ethyl, octyl or octadecyl is as follows: RP-18\> RP-8 \> RP-2\. For example, Hawach [Reversed Phase C18 SPE Cartridges](https://www.hawach.com/products/reversed-phase-c18-spe-cartridges/).

The operation method is a chromatographic method in which the separation coefficients of the components in the stationary phase (liquid) and the mobile phase (liquid) are different.

While Ion exchange chromatography utilizes the difference in the ability of the separated component to interact with the stationary phase to effect separation.
