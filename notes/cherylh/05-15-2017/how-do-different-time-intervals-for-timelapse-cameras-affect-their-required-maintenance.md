###What I want to do or know
[Fair Tech Collective](https://www.fairtechcollective.org/) folks are investigating options for configuring cameras to monitor oil refineries. 

We're curious how choices of temporal interval for timelapse cameras correlate with their maintenance needs, e.g. frequency of  battery changes, including in different climates? (These cameras would be in the San Francisco Bay Area.)
