###What I want to do
Purchase an IR pass filter (blocks everything but IR light) or more ideally purchase IR pass filter sheets to be modified for my Mobius 2 camera NDVI system. I want to see if using an IR pass filter on the modified (IR filter removed) Mobius camera will help with NDVI in any way.

###My attempt and results
I have not attempted this yet. I am on a fairly fixed budget (yay for being a student) and was hoping to get some input before pursuing this any farther.

###Questions and next steps
I have found amazon sells glass IR pass filters for SLR cameras and I found some online retailers that sell the small filters. I am hoping someone here might be able to chime in on the pros and cons of using this in a 2 camera NDVI system.

I noticed that all the one camera systems use a filter to block certain bands of light so the NIR shows up better but never have I seen a mention of using an IR pass filter on a 2 camera system. 
Would this be beneficial?
Would it make better images?
Can the current Fuji plugin be used with the IR pass filter?
Also if it is useful or worth a try what IR filter would be best for vegetation? They come in a variety of nm such as 760, 850, 950....
 
###Why I'm interested
Just curious if this might be beneficial.
