[I wrote a short piece](https://micromag.evidenceandinfluence.org/article/mapmaking-in-jerusalem/) about my work with Public Lab's tools in Jerusalem for the first issue of [Evidence and Influence Micro-Magazine](https://micromag.evidenceandinfluence.org/?issue=environment-and-justice), edited by the [Tactical Technology Collective](https://tacticaltech.org/). In this issue you can also find [a piece by Mikel Maron](https://micromag.evidenceandinfluence.org/article/10-maps-that-have-changed-how-we-see-the-environment/) who shares 10 inspirational environmental maps, including public lab's stuff, and other really interesting pieces from Lebannon, Liberia, Sudan, and more, in the context of info-activism. Check it out.
