I presented kite aerial photography in [Tactical Tech](tacticaltech.org)'s [Info-Activism camp](https://camp2013.tacticaltech.org/). Lot's of fascinating and hard working people around here that are changing the world bit by bit, and many were very interested in learning and applying the methods in different contexts. Together with Mikel Maron and Sajjad Anwar and other happy campers, we did a first experiment during a boat trip on lake Orta. There was hardly any wind... but we had great fun! Here are some unstitched photos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/fiestin/sets/72157634347288308/
