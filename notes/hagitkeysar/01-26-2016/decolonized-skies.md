PublicLab:Jerusalem, (accompanied by myself:), have participated in the exhibition "[Decolonized Skies](http://apexart.org/exhibitions/messer-reich.php)" in Tel Aviv, that was curated by Yael Messer and Gilad Reich ([High&Low Bureau](http://www.hlbureau.org/)) and was shown previously in New York and Barcelona.

The exhibition is a result of a research conducted by Yael and Gilad, and it went through various changes in the different places in which it was presented. In New York it also included a [balloon mapping workshop](http://apexart.org/events/diy-drones.php) with the title "[DIY Drones](https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/10-12-2014/decolonized-skies-at-apexart)" conducted by Liz Barry.
In Tel-Aviv Yael and Gilad wanted to feature Public Lab's work in Jerusalem and been putting the effort to give it significant space and attention in the exhibition. The whole space was designed by Hadas Zemer Ben Ari who did a great job. It has been a joy to work with each one of them, talking and thinking together, and besides all that it was a great opportunity for exposure.

Designer Roni Levit created this lovely Hebrew-Arabic infographics for the Balloon and Kite Mapping kit.

And there is also a small format catalog that features essays and and a generous description of each work in Hebrew, Arabic and English. If you are interested let me know and I can send you a copy!

**
There were no events in the exhibition. To the regret of the curators and myself a minor fuss around the "subversive" content in the exhibition deterred the gallery owners from promoting it any further. It was in direct relation to the current sad situation in Israel in which a witch hunt is being conducted against anyone who criticizes the state.
Here are some images from the catalog and a link to an article in Ha'aretz that expands in length about Public Lab's part in the exhibition.
