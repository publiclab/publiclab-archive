I am using some beautiful aerial maps created in mapknitter for the design of a series of posters publishing our departmental seminars at the Israeli Ben Gurion University Politics and Government department. So I am sharing them here, and will continue adding future ones to flickr. Here is a link to the posters: https://www.flickr.com/photos/fiestin/sets/72157633107169375/
