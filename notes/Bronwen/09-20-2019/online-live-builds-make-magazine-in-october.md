We're excited about our collaboration with Make Magazine (read about Public Lab in the upcoming issue!) . As part of this project, we'll be walking through the assembly and use of some Public Lab kits live online! (we'll update this page with links in the coming week). 

  
See below for build-along times and dates, and If you'd like to receive a \*free\* kit so that you can build along with us, [just click here to give us a little information and we can ship you a kit of your choice!](http://Bit.ly/2koQsD5 "http://bit.ly/2koQsD5") 

  
Resources are limited, so act soon!

  
Don't forget to share your projects with us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter: @PublicLab and @Make

  
Live builds are currently scheduled for:

  
October 3 --- 6 pm ET 

Build a Community Microscope! Using a webcam and a few pieces of hardware, make a microscope to get a closer look at your environment!

  
October 5 --- 3 pm ET

BabyLegs: Learn how to make this DIY trawl to collect samples from your local waterways! Look for microplastics, algae, organisms, and more!

  
October 9 --- 6 pm ET

It's two for one! We'll be demonstrating the Coqui (a DIY conductivity sensor) and a simple particulate sensor for studying air quality. 

  
October 28 --- 8 pm ET

Open Hour! Join us for a conversation online about any of our kits and community science. We'll be assembling papercraft spectrometers and will be available for questions, troubleshooting, and more!
