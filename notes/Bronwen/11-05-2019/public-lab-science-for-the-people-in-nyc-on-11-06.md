Join Public Lab and [Science For The People][1] at [the People's Forum][2] in NYC this Thursday, where Bronwen Densmore, Public Lab's Open Hardware Community Manager will lead a discussion about some of the ways that communities have used low cost, DIY and open source hardware in environmental monitoring, particularly in response to oil & gas issues.

We'll discuss some of the ways that community science and organizations like Public Lab can help support people in their responses to pollution. We'll ALSO have the chance to assemble and experiment with some of the low-cost tools that are being used and developed by contributors around the world.
