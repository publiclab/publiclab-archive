One of our [BabyLegs](https://publiclab.org/wiki/babylegs) Kickstarter backers asks (paraphrased):

  
Hi there, IÂ´d like to apply this, involving people into citizen science projects, but the plastic forensic analysis could be a problem.  

  
Is there some kind of alternative analysis platform? I was thinking if it would be possible to upload some images which in turn would be analyzed by experts?
