If anyone needs some space in NYC to work on hardware, Fat Cat Fab Lab just launched a sponsored membership program-- They've hosted Public Lab workshops in the past and have generally been an enthusiastic supporter of Public Lab folks in NYC. Project proposals don't need to fall into any specific category, but it would be awesome to see some environmental tools or bio art get some of that support!
