When we meet in Galveston. we'll be setting aside time and space for a dive / exploration into environmental monitoring tools and practices: both as activities AND as an opportunity to brainstorm about the kinds of things we'd like to see available in our communities. This is for everyone: you don't have to bring any particular skill set to participate, just an interest and willingness to jump into the process with your own questions and ideas.

We're interested in hearing what you want to work on together in our hands-on & DIY spaces! We're putting together our supply list, and would love to hear your thoughts about:

- What kinds of tools or materials do you like to work with? Are you interested in Electronics? 3-D printing? Photography?Prototyping with cardboard? Drafting on paper?
- What environmental issues are you most interested in delving into?
- What do you most want to learn?

We're putting a shopping/sourcing list together, so you can add materials requests and questions/thoughts/ideas below, or add to [our spreadsheet, here.](https://publiclab.org/barnraising#Materials+and+Questions)

Especially interested in hearing from some of folks who will be in attendance: @Obasegun @danbeavers @zengirl2 @SadiePrego @eustatic @caguldi03 @read\_holman @susanjacobson @bljohns7 @a1ahna @cess @Pat @magictowers
