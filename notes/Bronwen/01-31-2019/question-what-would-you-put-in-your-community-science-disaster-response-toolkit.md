This coming Monday we'll be having an [Open Hour][1] call to talk about what we'd want to include in a Community Science Disaster Response Toolkit, and then in February we'll be [gathering in Galveston, TX in February][2] to continue exploring ways to identify tools and methods that can be used to gather data about environmental impact before and after an environmental emergency, especially ones related to storms and floods. 

Are there things you'd recommend, or want to include in an environmental response emergency kit? Some of the questions we've been thinking about include:

- What are best practices in terms of health and safety in flood and storm events (particularly relating exposure to waterborne contaminants during and after)?
- What kind of real-time data is meaningful to collect? What can wait? What are the most important data collection tools to have on hand (cameras, sensors, chemical tests, etc).
- In terms of remediation/recovery, how do you identify areas for further attention/research?
- If you plan to pursue legal / regulatory enforcement with your findings, are there specific guidelines to be aware of when it comes to documentation, chain of custody, data storage, etc?We'd love to know what other questions we should be asking, and what you think we should drop into this bucket.
