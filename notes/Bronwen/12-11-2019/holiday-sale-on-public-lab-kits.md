Are you thinking of giving a Public Lab kit to someone this holiday season? Community science tools make great gifts: learn how to build and use your tools now, so you can get outside and start collecting new information about your environment in the new year.   

  
Between now and Dec 15th you can use the discount code [HOLIDAY19](https://store.publiclab.org/) for 15% off of DIY Spectrometers, Kite and Balloon Mapping Kits, and Community Microscopes! Supplies are limited, so place your orders early!

  
Domestic orders placed by December 15 will ship in time for arrival by December 24\.
