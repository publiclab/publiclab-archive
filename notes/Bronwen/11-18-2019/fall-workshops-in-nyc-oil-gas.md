**September 28 1-5pm - Wepa Festival Table**

At this workshop, Public Lab offered hands-on demonstrations at a table at the [WEPA festival][1], an event focusing on Latin American culture and heritage. Throughout the afternoon, we were able to demonstrate assembly and use of tools, share information about Public Lab’s work, and talk to other people and organizations sho who have been involved with community-based air quality monitoring in Brooklyn. Big thanks to @SadiePrego for the invite, and for helping with demonstrations (especially in Spanish!!)

**October 31 22-5pm - Science at the Queensbridge Tech Houses**

Public Lab visited the [Queensbridge Houses Tech Lab][4] to present tools to young people as part of their “Spooky Science” Halloween Programming: this is a community space we'd visited earlier in the year for a [balloon mapping event][5]. Most  attendees were young people who we worked with one-on-one or with family groups throughout the afternoon-- we dressed our air sensors up in Halloween-appropriate  costumes, listened to the conductivity of water and checked out some of the local microbes with the Community Microscopes! If you want to see more of the environmental programming that has been taking place at this location, [see more of Sadie's work here][6].

**November 6, 7:30-9:30 - NYC Science for the People, November Meeting** 

We presented the work of Public Lab in Community Science at the NYC chapter of Science for the People November Meeting: discussing how our community processes are able to support tool development, network building, and advocacy, followed by a demonstration of the Simple Air Sensors and the Community Microscope.  We had an especially great demonstration of the Simple Air Sensor's response to a lit match, and were able to count down how long it took for sensors spaced out along the length of the room to respond. Sadly, our video of this test didn't turn out, so we'll be recreating this experiment later.
