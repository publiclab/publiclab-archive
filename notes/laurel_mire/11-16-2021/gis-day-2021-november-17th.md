## Tomorrow (November 17th) is World GIS Day! 

**Geographic information systems (GIS)** is “a scientific framework for gathering, analyzing, and visualizing geographic data to help make better decisions” ([GIS Day][2]).

GIS Day is a chance to learn about the real world applications of GIS that can save the planet and change the world for the better! There are [lots of ways to celebrate GIS Day][3], but here are some of my favorites…

 - ***Attend an event near you & meet local GIS professionals and enthusiasts!*** Check out [this page][4] to learn more & scroll to the world map at the bottom to find events near you
- ***Talk to friends & family about GIS!*** Lots of people haven’t heard of GIS, so spreading the word helps raise awareness of how GIS can be used to visualize data,  share information, and spur change 
- ***Explore [ArcGIS StoryMaps][5]!***  StoryMaps are a fantastic and increasingly popular way to convey location-based information and stories linked together by geography & time
- ***Make a map!*** Check out this [simple beginner tutorial of QGIS][6], an open-source GIS software, or follow along [this tutorial][7] from SheetMapper if you already have data you’d like to display 
- ***Watch a documentary from the [GIS Film Festival][8]!*** A collaboration between Esri and National Geographic to “celebrate geography and inspire a new generation of  digital explorers”, this documentary mini-series features the work of National Geographic Explorers like Jane Goodall using GIS


####Let me know what you're doing to celebrate the power of GIS!
