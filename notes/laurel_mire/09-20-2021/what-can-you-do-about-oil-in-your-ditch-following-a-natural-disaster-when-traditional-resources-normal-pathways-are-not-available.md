I was recently walking around my neighborhood following Hurricane Ida’s landfall and noticed many ditches had that classic rainbow oil sheen. The oil could be from any number of sources---portable generators, clean up and tree cutting crews, more “normal” sources like cars. With so much infrastructure down (phones, internet, roads blocked, etc) and city departments closed, does anyone have any ideas as to how to address oil in ditches after a natural disaster yourself/without normal pathways available?
