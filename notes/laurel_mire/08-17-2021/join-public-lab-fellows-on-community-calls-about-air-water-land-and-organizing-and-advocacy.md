**If you're looking for a virtual space to gather and talk about environmental health topics, join us on an upcoming community call! ☎️**

  
Public Lab's [Research Curation Fellows](https://publiclab.org/wiki/research-curation-fellows) are hosting community calls throughout the year on broad topics covering ******air, water, land,****** and **organizing and advocacy**. Calls are held on Zoom and are open to anyone interested in asking questions, sharing tips, and exchanging stories about local environmental health and community science.  

Calls for each topic happen roughly every 3 months. **To find out when the next call is, check out [Events by Research Curation Fellows](https://publiclab.org/wiki/research-curation-fellows#Events+by+Research+Curation+Fellows "https://publiclab.org/wiki/research-curation-fellows#Events+by+Research+Curation+Fellows")**[](https://publiclab.org/wiki/research-curation-fellows#Events+by+Research+Curation+Fellows). You'll find a monthly calendar of expected calls for each topic, and a list of event posts with exact dates/times and call-in details.
