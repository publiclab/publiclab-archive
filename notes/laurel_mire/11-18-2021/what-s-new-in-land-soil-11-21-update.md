##Land Community Call
Last week, Public Lab held its quarterly community call focused on sharing experiences, concerns, and resources falling under the topics of land & soil. Thank you to @Pat for attending and sharing your vast knowledge about the frac sand mine industry, your passion for citizen science and community organizing, and your advice for young community scientists--- ‚Äúpersistence and determination are key!‚Äù Check out the notes from the call [here][1]. 

<br>

##Resources

####Community Groups/Networks
+ [Citizen Action Wisconsin ‚Äì People are the Source of Our Strength][2] -- Pat has worked with this group to address climate change and promote sustainability at the county level
+ [Frac Sand Sentinel ‚Äì Save The Hills Alliance][3] -- Pat‚Äôs newsletter focusing on fracking topics like air, water, health impacts, and mine reclamation.
+ [FracTracker][4]---‚ÄùFracTracker uses mapping and data visualization tools like aerial imagery (with the help of [LightHawk][5]), georeferencing, drone footage, and GIS to confront the impacts and injustices of the fossil fuel industry and develop data and maps to fuel community-led campaigns.‚Äù
+ [Halt the Harm Network][6] -- A collaboration of grassroots organizations sharing resources on the oil and gas industry tailored to your zip code & connecting concerned citizens

##Mapping & Data Visualization Tools
+ FracTracker has a [National Energy Map][7] showing pretty much everything to do with energy resources across the US, from extraction sites and storage facilities to refineries and pipelines
+ [AshTracker][8] -- Data visualization and data download tool making industry data on groundwater contamination at coal ash pits accessible and easily understandable
+ [Coal Ash Pollution Documentation][9] resource from the [Environmental Integrity Project][10] -- Another coal ash data resource; examines newly available data about groundwater contamination from coal ash (now required by the 2015 Coal Ash Rule)
    + Fill out a release form to download their database of groundwater monitoring reports from 265 regulated coal plants and coal ash dumps
    + Also from the Environmental Integrity Project, check out their photo storytelling project about the [‚ÄúHuman Cost of Energy‚Äù][11]
+ [EJSCREEN][12] -- An open source GIS/mapping tool from the EPA great for easy data visualization
    + Pair your own shapefiles with numerous spatial data layers pre-loaded on the tool (environmental & demographic indicators, locations of schools, Superfund sites, public transportation, etc) 
    + Use the ruler tool to calculate the distance from one point to another (For example, this school is x meters from a superfund site.)
+ [Justice Map][13] -- Another mapping tool to ‚Äúvisualize race and income data in your community‚Äù
