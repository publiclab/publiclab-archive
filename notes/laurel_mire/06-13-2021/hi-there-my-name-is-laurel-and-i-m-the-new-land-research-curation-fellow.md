Hi there! My name is Laurel, and I'm an aspiring environmental scientist from New Orleans and the new land research curation fellow. I just graduated from Tulane University and am excited to dive into the world of community science to learn more about the relationship between land loss, soil contamination, and the oil and gas industry as well as play a role in making the scientific field more accessible to those on the frontlines of environmental justice issues. I also love mapping and GIS and am eager to learn more about utilizing those tools for community science. Swampy Louisiana is pretty flat...so I took to the skies via a nearby parking garage for this picture. If you squint,  you can see downtown New Orleans and the Superdome pretty well from my neighborhood! I'm so excited to jump in and become a part of this awesome community!
