Hi folks -

The spectrometer works great and I can capture spectra using the spectral workbench software at:

https://spectralworkbench.org/capture/#page1

But how do I calibrate? There is no calibrate button shown.

I'm running the software in Firefox under Linux Mint.

Thanks for any help.
