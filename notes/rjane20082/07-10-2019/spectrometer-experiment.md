I see that you are chossing to use your spectrometers as transmission spectroscopes but have you tried setting materials on fire and analyzing the emission spectras i have a rudimentary spectroscope made from paper, cd and smart phone with ir filter still inside and can still detect the difference spectra between burning butane and wood. What are the limitations?
