We are introducing a balloon video project for my section of Pratt's Expanded Digital Cinema class next Monday. This will be a kind of pilot project to see how it works. Then next year we will introduce it as a class project for all the sections. We built harnesses for the GoPro video cameras that we have in our department out of Volvic and Poland Springs water bottles.
