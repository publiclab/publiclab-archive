I have decided to upload and share some of my first spectra taken within the first day of using the Kickstarter kit.

 I would be happy if you could drop your tips and recommendations on what to improve and so on.

First here is a <strong>spectrum of CFL bulb</strong> by Ikea (GA607).

I calibrated this spectra using built-in calibration function and decided to compare this spectrum with CFL spectra of different users:

What I am curious about is that the spectra fit in positions of calibrated peaks but the peaks from 560 nm have different wavelengths. I am not sure if that is because of different light source or because the calibration  is not proper. I need to measure more CFL spectra with my Spectrometer first.

Another issue I need to fix is the interference caused with the blue led diod of the webcam from the Kickstarter kit. It makes a wide peak in the spectra. I have already read about this on the on Google Group: The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science ›
Desktop Spectro Kit - Blue LED Question and My General Build Experiences, so I will try to fix this later.

Let me know about your issues and fixes to the Kickstarter DIY kits.
