Hi everybody, as I wrote in the previous post, my webcam broke after two days of light usage, so I decided to buy a new one, but it was not possible to get the same one because it is not available here (the Czech Republic), so I bought Genius webcam. Because of its size I also had to find different box for the spectrometer, so actually I make all new spectrometer. I share some photos here and also two spectra. The first is a CFL source measured with the tested kickstarter spectrometer and the second is measured with the new one. I also add a photo from the webcam where you can see what the webcam captures when taking the spectra. 

I would be happy if you can  try to work out what is wrong. Maybe refocusing could help as the DVD layer is at different distance from the sensor... I really have no idea. It is focused on 9 inch now.
