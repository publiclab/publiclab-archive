I found this on YOUTUBE and think it is worth sharing.

An accurate balance is a crucial piece of equipment needed for serious analytical work. When preparing reagents such as calibration standards or colour development reagents a good quality balance with a resolution of 0.0001 grams is essential. Good quality analytical balances are rather expensive and can range from $ 1500 - $ 2500. Personally I wonâ€™t be tinkering with this concept as I already have an analytical balance.  I still think it will be great if a cheap alternative can be developed.
