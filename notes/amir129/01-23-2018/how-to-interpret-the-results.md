Hi,

I have a question. I am seeing so many graph sets/ comparison posted on the [https://spectralworkbench.org](https://spectralworkbench.org) website.

How do you interpret the result? let's say I collected three readings of beet root water with different dilution and uploaded the images to spectral workbench website. I will probably show the graph, but how will I interpret the result of which one has higher concentration? or diluted one?

I don't know much about Science but just trying to help out my daughter for her school project, so please let me where can I get some information about interpreting the graph.

Thanks in advance.
