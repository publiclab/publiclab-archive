###What I want to do
I want to use the Desktop Spectrometry Kit to classify different types of Local Brews in Connecticut
###My attempt and results

###Questions and next steps
I am curious as to how this kit works in terms of what types of results this kit gives. Does it give spectral data as in IR which shows functional groups or data pertaining to a UV-Vis which give absorbance and transmittance values?
###Why I'm interested
