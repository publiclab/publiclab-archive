I am currently trying to build a 'low cost' NDVI sensor for a university dissertation. I am in the beginning stages and my initial idea was to use an RGB image and an NoIR image and combine the 2 but it comes with its own set of challenges. Is it possible to. Use an NIR sensitive camera to take the image and then use take the red and the NIR as two separate copies of the same image and merge them instead?
