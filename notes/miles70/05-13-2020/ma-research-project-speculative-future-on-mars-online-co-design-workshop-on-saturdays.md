Hello travellers,

Hope you are well, and your family and friends are safe in this global pandemic.

My name is Miles Williams, I’m a Masters Student at the University of the Arts London: London College of Communication.

I am currently working on a speculative co-design project, which is my chosen theme which is the future colonization of Mars, and my question is: ‘What would a self-sustainable home look like on Mars?’. I would be grateful if you could join me in hosting an online co-design workshop that I’ve set up.

I am looking for volunteers who specialise in different fields, such as Engineering, Farming, Psychiatry, Space Exploration, Biology and Architecture. The duration of these workshops will be a maximum 1-hour long session and will be hosted every Saturday, starting on the 16th of May 2020.
I have not put time as of now, so as, to make it convenient for all participants. Perhaps a poll could help? What time works best for you?

These methods of co-design can be widely used in your practices when you are collaborating with other practitioners, which can be of benefit for you.

Please note, the workshop will be recorded for insights for my academic project.
Thanks for taking the time to read this.

The link below is a form, please fill in the requirements.

details of my email are in the link.

Please note.
In order to join the online workshop, I have to send you an invitation link via Mural.
Please drop me an email to confirm you can join. Much appreciated.
I'm not expecting everyone to commit to each session, but, you can invite your friends who would be interested in taking part in the session if they are available.

Name: Workshop 1: Signal and Patterns mapping with stakeholders
Date: Saturday, 16th May, 2020
Time: TBA
Platform: Mural

Details:
To help determine the direction we are heading in. As Thomas More once said, “You wouldn't abandon ship in a storm just because you couldn't control the winds.”
Our goal is to make Future 1 the priority: what legislation, demographic, resources and technological advancements need to take place? Could we create a Utopia on Mars?
Future 2, can be a Future we can accept, but it is not perfect; what needs to take place for it to become reality? How do we remove the metaphorical pebble from the shoe?
And Future 3 will be a future we don't want. What don’t we want to happen? A disastrous dystopia!

Name: Workshop 2: 6 thinking hats with Stakeholders
Date: Saturday, 23rd May 2020
Time: TBA
Platform: Mural

Details:
In pairs, we are using Sir Edward de Bono's ‘Lateral Thinking’ to creatively think of a narrative utilising your expertise and industry knowledge.

Name: Workshop 3: Exploring the 5 senses and drawing the scenarios
Date: Sunday, 24th May 2020
Time: TBA
Platform: Skype and Google slides

Details:
Following on from the idea of de Bono’s 'Lateral Thinking', exploring the five senses of smell, touch, hearing, sight and taste; you’ll illustrate your thoughts and present them on Google slides.
