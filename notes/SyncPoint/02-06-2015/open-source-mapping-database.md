###What I want to do:
 share my created mapping database for feedback, analyses and education

###My attempt and results
 my attempt is to create a universal automated quadcopter mapper, a scientific gopro-like attachment.
Currently I am regularly monitoring a specific area at a regular interval. 

###Questions and next steps
my question is if there are any people inside the community that would benefit from my database, and if so, I would make my private datasets public.

###Why I'm interested
This project of mine is meant as a master thesis project. however i have taken it a lot further and now i am wondering if there is any demand for these types of datasets.
