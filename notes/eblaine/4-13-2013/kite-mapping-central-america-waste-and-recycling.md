<strong>El Rama, Nicaragua</strong>

Since September 2012, I have been working on an existing waste management and recycling project in El Rama, in the Southern Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAS) of Nicaragua. My work has been predominantly with MIT's CoLab (Community Innovators Lab) and D-Lab (Development Lab). 

In January 2013, I spent three weeks in El Rama working on foundational research to determine the current formal and informal waste situation. Our team focused on participatory mapping activities, meetings and waste sorting with informal recyclers (papenadores, or 'wastepickers'), observation and data collection on the current formal and informal waste flows through El Rama, and meetings with the municipal government. 

As part of the project, we used kite mapping as a way to document the current informal landfill. All of the waste collected by El Rama's trash trucks comes to this landfill, which is situated on the site of an existing wetland. The mapping activity was also used to engage local informal recyclers. 

I will return to El Rama in the summer of 2013 to continue work on this project, which includes formalizing a recycling cooperative, determining a collection route with informal recyclers for local business' plastics pick-up, and continuing with capacity building and trainings with informal recycling businesses.

<strong>San Blas Region, Cart'i Islands, Panam'a
</strong>
In February, 2013 I traveled to the Atlantic coastal Cart'i Islands in the San Blas region of Panam'a, with others from MIT's CoLab, D-Lab, and Sloan School of Management, as well as a representatives from IADB and local NGOs ANCON and IDIKY. 

The goal of this phase of the project was to gather data in order to complete a baseline report on the Kuna Yala peoples' current waste management system, waste composition, value chain, and residents' habits. An important component was to begin to understand and map the flow and impacts of waste in the San Blas region, especially between the Cart'i Islands. 

We used kite mapping to get detailed aerial photos of the islands to facilitate the future mapping out of a waste collection route between the islands. We also used kite mapping to get the first photos taken of the informal dump Cart'i Islanders are currently using -- an open dumpsite along the beach and in the mangrove forest on the mainland.
