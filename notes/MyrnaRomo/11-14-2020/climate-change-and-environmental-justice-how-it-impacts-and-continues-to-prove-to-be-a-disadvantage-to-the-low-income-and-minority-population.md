### Introduction:

Climate change is real.  Climate change has been scientifically proven.  The evidence is all around us from global temperature rise, shrinking ice sheets, sea level rise, to extreme weather events.  But why does this continue to be an issue of controversy and why do so many ignore the issues and continue to go about their days as if it is not an issue of immediate concern?  

Our main concern:

How can we support and improve climate change without it having to affect the people that rely on these polluting industries as source of income?  

### Obstacles and supporting information:

People rely on polluting industries as a source of income and livelihood.  Now more than ever during these challenging times we are seeing a decrease in employment and people are taking jobs in industries that are putting their health and the health of the planet in danger.  

### Who is engaged in this concern?

Organizations involved in supporting Climate Change and Environmental Justice are working on these issues but they are constantly challenged and suppressed due to politics and the need for a healthy economy. 

### What are the initial questions?
