###What I want to do
Hi all,

I recently received my Infragram Point and Shoot Plant Cam from Public Lab, and an additional DIY Plant Analysis Filter Kit for converting a future spare camera.

I've followed all instructions for the Plant Cam (installing custom white balance file, ensuring the firmware is v. 1.2).

Unfortunately images off the camera do not look like NGB images, but rather look like regular photos with  a very blue white balance (setting the white balance to [7], or just regular images (setting the white balance to [8]) in the SYSCFG.TXT file).

I've attached samples of the images I'm getting - may I have received an unmodded Mobius Action cam by mistake?

###Questions and next steps

- Are these images that seem to be from a camera correctly converted?
- Would you recommend using the red or blue filter if I do need to mod the mobs?
- Must I remove an IR filter in the action cam?

Really appreciate anyone's help,
Alex
