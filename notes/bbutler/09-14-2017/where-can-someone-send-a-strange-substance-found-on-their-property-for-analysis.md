I wanted to see if someone could help me identify a lab that can analyze a sample of a gum-like substance that a local resident is concerned about. I'm sure it would help to have more information but right now all we know is it's in front of and behind her property, located in the bayview hunters point community which has a host of pollution sources and legacy contamination (superfund site). I was just wondering if there was some way to have it analyzed to see what it is without knowing what it could potentially be. With that being said, do you know of any labs that I could reach out to on this? Please let me know.
