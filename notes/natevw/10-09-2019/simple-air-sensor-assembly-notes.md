### How the activity went

> I helped my 10yo assemble this kit. He was successful. When we blow out a candle the light turns red almost right away!

### Issues I encountered

> The cable was an intimidating brush of tangled wire strands when we got it. I think it would have been very hard to get into the breadboard that way. After separating the wires, we rolled them together and tinned them with some solder.
> 
> It took a couple starts to get all the connections to fit, but since there aren't very many it wasn't such a big deal.

### Suggestions

> The cable was the biggest hurdle, since it needed tinning to be breadboard-friendly and it was a bit of an extra puzzle matching up the wires compared with the different cable shown in the assembly pictures. It was a good experience for my kid though and he figured it out quick enough.
