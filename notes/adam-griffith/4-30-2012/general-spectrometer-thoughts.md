On an airplane in Europe, I had a great conversation with Dr. G. Tempea, a laser physicist, regarding spectral resolution.

Design ideas:
- could the resolution be increased by using a Blu-Ray DVD as the diffraction grating?
- could the resolution be increased by using a camera with a larger sensor?  Higher megapixels?
- what are the CCD limitations?
- could the resolution be increased by increasing the distance between the diffraction grating and the "screen?"

Application idea:
- color calibration for computer monitors.  Right now, the software to do color matching (for printing, among other things) is expensive and proprietary.
