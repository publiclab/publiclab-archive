Hello Public Laboratory Community:

1)	Google will be scanning maps created by our community to possibly be imported into GoogleEarth/Maps.  Be sure to export maps and click public domain license.

2)	Home made kites are sexy!  Don’t believe us?  Check out these photos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/lizbarry/7741080632/in/photostream/

3)	Pix4d auto-stitching is a viable alternative to manual methods, Photoshop, or Image Composite Editor.  Pat Coyle and Mat Lippincot demonstrate this with this research note and map: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/mapknitter/8-8-2012/mapknitter-pix4d-processed-robertson-park-livermore-ca

4)	Our spectral library is growing at spectralworkbench.org and a new illustrated guide to making your very own spectrometer has made its way to our instructables:
