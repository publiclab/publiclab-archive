We are planning to build a watercraft to be used as a platform for water quality measurements. The aim of the craft is to serve both those taking the measurements and 

  
The boat structure is based on two hulls made of used truck tarp that encloses closed PET bottles and construction scaffolding bridging the two hulls, providing a mounting for the floor and box as well as the engine. 

  
This is extremely early work at this stage. The initial objectives of the platform seeks to support are: 

  
- timed samples for archiving, eventually having this be automated completely. 

- spectrophotometry

- bench space for hacking sensors / cabins for the crew to be able to spend multiple days on board. Ideally a workbench where one could assemble or diagnose problems in something like https://publiclab.org/wiki/mae-d-agua

  
The current planed sizing is 12m long and 5 m wide, with the tarp filled with bottles having a maximum diameter of 80cm, given by using the 2.7m width of the truck tarp as the skin of a cylinder. Attempts at having the trips of the hulls smoothly curve to a point. One of the collaborators has experience building a sailing catamaran in a similar sizing, also using constructing scaffolding for the bridge structure (in that case the hulls are made of wood and have interior space, and it is much more of a seaworthy vessel, while this is meant strictly for calm waterways. You can learn more about her https://esperantos.eu/ )

  
The material resources are committed, and the human resources seem to be coming together. The aim is to have the hulls and a first iteration of the lab/shelter structure in the water by end of September. One possibility that is tempting for the intial setup is 

  
We have some success obtaining almost pristine discarded MDF for free. There is a desire to minimize the use of epoxy, so much thought is being placed on how to protect it from the water. The current best thinking involves tarps and the use a heat source inside the shelter to evaporate humidity. We are very keen on other designs. Structurally above the floor of the craft we are considering wether to initially use a pair of geodomes since they are light and relatively fast to setup up. 5 meters being a natural diameter. 

  
We are very keen to hear feedback from others who have attempted related projects, or those who would like to collaborate in its co-creation.
