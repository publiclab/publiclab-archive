KnowFlow is back

I think I haven't had time to continue to push this project for a while, and I have been dragged by other projects this year. Fortunately, these projects have already made a paragraph. I finally have time to come back and look at this project.

The good news is that in the next few weeks, I will be pushing this project to have an NB-IoT-based version.

The new version will feature a range of features such as NB-IoT, Wifi, Bluetooth, solar battery management, low power consumption and more.

I hope that if everything goes well, the demo will probably be made in a few weeks.

I hope everyone can enjoy this news and hope that everyone will continue to support our project.

KnowFlow回来了

我想我大概有一段时间没有空来继续推动这个项目了，这一年来我被其他的项目一直拖着。好在现在这些项目都已经搞一个段落了。我终于有时间回来看一下这个项目了。

好消息是，在接下来的几周里，我将推动这个项目有一个基于NB-IoT的版本。

新的版本将会拥有NB-IoT、Wifi、蓝牙、太阳能电池管理、低功耗等等一系列的特性。

希望一切顺利的话demo大概会在几周后做出来。

希望大家能喜欢这个消息，也希望大家能一如既往的支持我们这个项目。
