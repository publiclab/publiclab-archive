Hi there

I am very new to all this and needs some help to figure out what I am doing wrong. 

  
I am recording images on a Pi NoIR camera with a red filter (also tried a blue filter). I download the images to my laptop and then upload to infragram. I run the preset for NDVI for RED filters - colourized. But all I get is a blue image - see attached screenshot. The image is of shrubs and non-organic matter, so would expect I would be able to see a differential between things. I am really not sure what I am doing wrong? 

Any advice to a newbie would be greatly appreciated.

The same image as it came out of the Pi NoIR camera without any presets/changes:
