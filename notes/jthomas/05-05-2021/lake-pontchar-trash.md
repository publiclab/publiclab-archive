### Introduction:

We are Brother Martin students discussing trash in Lake Pontchartrain. We are interested in measuring how much trash ends up in the lake.  Our school is only a few miles from Lake Pontchartrain, and it is a beautiful feature in our local environment.  We want to keep it free from trash as much as possible. In order to do this we must contribute to stop this pollution from occurring and know how to keep our environment & waters safe.

###   

### Our main concern:

One of the main concerns of the trash in the water is that  the trash damages the environment, kills wildlife, spreads diseases, and pollutes the water making it risky for people to swim. Trash in Lake Pontratrain affects recreational activities, shrimping, crabbing, and fishing.

Obstacles and supporting information:  

- Time constraints to complete the research during our class
- Need certain tools to measure trash
- Minimizing our impact on wildlife while conducting research

- Potential weather issues 
- Conducting on-site research as a class

###   

### Who is engaged in this concern?

- Beach Sweep is a community clean up crew that helped clean up the shores of Lake Pontchartrain. 
- Part of the International Ocean Conservancy project that tracks trash in all the waters of the world.
- People began to rally a campaign known as Save the Lake.
  - Emerged as the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation
  - LPBF changed name to Pontchartrain Conservancy, a non profit organization that helps clean up trash.
- The community volunteers to help clean up.
-   
### What are the initial questions?

- How are animals affected by trash in LP? 
- What is the most efficient way to clean up trash? 
- Can trash from the lake clog drains?
- How can we help keep the lake clean? 
- How is the trash getting into the lake?  
- What types of trash are generally found in LP?
- What tools can we use to measure trash in LP?
