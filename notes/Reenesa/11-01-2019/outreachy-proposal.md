## Project description

### 

Refine Geographic UI and JS Integration for [PublicLab.org](http://PublicLab.org)

**Abstract/summary (<20 words):**

### 

Refine existing geographical features so that they are consistent and user-friendly.\*\*  
\*\*

**Problem**

### 

The problems to be addressed are as follows

- Users on [https://publiclab.org/profile](https://publiclab.org/profile) should be prompted to add geographical location. Therefore it should be _obvious whether or where the user should add a geographical location._
- The website should state the safety of the user after adding their location. It should be clear as to why the user is adding their location
- Pages like [https://publiclab.org/puerto-rico](https://publiclab.org/puerto-rico) should persist geographical tags when something is posted from that page.
- There should be consistency in geographic tags to buttons related to a specific post
- User should be able to embed a map on a wiki page or when posting a question.
- \_When viewing a map, it should be possible to embed that map on other pages. \*\*

Proposed solution\*\*

Adding functionality to already existing maps, correcting bugs and implementing new features.

**Advantages of the proposed solution:**

- Adding user-friendly map features which will increase the
overall experience of the user
- Enabling a user to be able to share or embed a map on other pages.
- Users will be clearly be prompted to add their geographical location and the location privacy will be clear to them
- Posts and comments to a Geo-tagged page will persist Geo-coordinates hence one will be able to easily relate posts, comments and pages of a specific geographical area.

**Experience**
I studied software engineering, however, my cording career started after attending a Women in Technology program which ignited my spirit and I knew I could also make it in this field. However, even before that, I used to develop webpages in plain HTML and CSS or WordPress. some of the work I have done is listed below. and other work is on [https://github.com/susanreenesaa](https://github.com/susanreenesaa) and [https://gitlab.com/Reenesa](https://gitlab.com/Reenesa).

Experience Acquired through the different projects;

use of version control systems,

materialized CSS, bootstrap, HTML, CSS, java script, python, react, redux and node js

**Teamwork**
I have collaborated on a number of different projects through university, Andela women in technology program and MatatuHub. In some projects, I was just learning the basics of using version control systems while others I was performing different tasks as shown below.
[https://github.com/susanreenesaa/newsApi](https://github.com/susanreenesaa/newsApi) and [https://github.com/susanreenesaa/iReporter](https://github.com/susanreenesaa/iReporter).
I worked along side my project coordinator for guidelines and other cycle 5 members to create a news command line ApI.
its a command line app that returns top 10 news headlines from the selected news source. My duties were to create tasks on the trello board and build the Api
[https://github.com/susanreenesaa/BankAccount](https://github.com/susanreenesaa/BankAccount). Team of 2\. Bank account app. That enables a user to open an account and perform different operations like checking balance, depositing, withdrawing only if the account is active.
