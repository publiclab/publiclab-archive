I am trying to use the copy calibration function on my spectra, but every time I find the calibration and hit "Apply" nothing happens. I was doing the same thing yesterday and I was able to get pretty fast results as the x axis changed to wavelength in nanometers. Has something changed or am I doing something wrong? To be more specific about my current procedure this is what I've been doing:

  
1\. I calibrate my image and save it

2\. I go to a new spectra that needs to be calibrated and hit "copy calibration"

3\. I find the calibration from step 1

4\. I hit apply and wait

  
Thanks!
