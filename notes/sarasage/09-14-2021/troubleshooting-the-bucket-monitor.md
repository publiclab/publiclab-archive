Checking with the Public Lab community to see if anyone can assist me with some issues I am having with the bucket monitor.

I had a perfect opportunity to pull a grab sample last week, but could not get the Tedlar bag to inflate. I suspect the failure was because I had left the intake port plug off of the monitor, but there are other questions I have, as well:

_The intake port plug was replaced. I think its absence prevented the Tedlar bag from inflating._

## Does the black valve on the Tedlar bag need to be closed completely?![image description](/i/44816.jpg "Tedlar_Bag_Valve.jpg")

_Also, what is the valve for and what happens if you loosen it?_

## Does every Tedlar sample require single-use ferrules and a nut?

_Is it correct to assume you need a front and back back ferrule, as well as a Swagelok end nut per grab sample?_

## Should the pump be set to inflate, not deflate?![image description](/i/44820.jpg "IMG-5220.jpg")![image description](/i/44818.jpg "Pump_Setup.jpg")\_

_Seems like an obvious question, but I want to verify. Thank you!_
