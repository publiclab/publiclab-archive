Problem:

We are testing air quality with handheld devices that have internal dataloggers, but do do not have GPS. The area we are testing does not have cellphone reception and cannot rely on our phones to send data. Our project goal is to create a map with the AQ data results.\[notes:air quality\]

How can we design an automated GPS logger so that we can correlate the data from our handheld devices with a specific location?
