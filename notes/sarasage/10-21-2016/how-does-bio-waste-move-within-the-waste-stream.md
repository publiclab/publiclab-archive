###How can we track the movement of biological waste in regions, such as sewage, and medical waste? 

Besides CalEPA's TRI Reporting system, are there other databases that this category of waste? 

##This is for the [SoCal Waste Stream Mapping](https://publiclab.org/wiki/mapping-the-waste-stream-of-southern-california) project.

Thank you!
