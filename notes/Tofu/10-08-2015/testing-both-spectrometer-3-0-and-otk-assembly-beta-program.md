Hi!


First part, assembly of the spectrometer and OTK

Shipping boxes, simple, elegant

[![IMG_2701.JPG](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/796/medium/IMG_2701.JPG)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/796/original/IMG_2701.JPG)



I like the idea of a "low cost home spectrometer" so I might get a little overboard here... 

OK, so is the kit safe with kids around? A believe yes (But parents need to hide the laser and oils)
The only caution is the possible small and sharp DVD pieces 
Is it easy to let on the side partly assembled? Yes
Is it easy to repair? Yes 
Can it be managed and used on a kitchen table? Yes

What about a rainy delivery of the kit? Can high humidity be a problem for the OTK? 

Comments for the written documents
- Page numbers for quick reference
- To some people, going to step 1,2,3 is easier and also make troubleshooting easier
- In the images, the contrast for the edges should be more clear. I tried to assemble the kit with only the content of the boxes but also had to rely on the website 
- A list of proposed tools for assembly and testing (scissors will be easy to get but not everyone has a CFL)
-Bigger and uniform fonts

Straightforward instructions for the DVD, must be added earlier in the text that the edge of the DVD must be oriented

If you have large fingers, it takes a moment to get used to the tape

The only place I find a little fragile on the spectrometer

Again, straightforward

For people not used to large bands of tapes, it could be added to slowly remove backing from the velcro as you apply it

Adjusting the slite with the tip of scissors worked well


[![IMG_2720.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/801/medium/IMG_2720.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/801/original/IMG_2720.jpg)

The OTK pieces are a little less obvious to figure out as is (With blurry image...)

I knew the v shape piece was too big but it was a good place to try what if someone tried hard to make it fit anyway
Well, I think the v shape could be doubled (the m shape also), I know that I will take out the laser and hide it from kids at home, so I believe it should be stronger

Removing the extra 1-2 mm from the v shape piece

I had some trouble with this fold 
As noted elsewhere, a white mark should be added to help find the openings

[![IMG_2725.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/876/medium/IMG_2725.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/876/original/IMG_2725.jpg)

What demanded a readjustment is the tape on the back of the camera. After I started calibrating and experiencing with various light sources, moving the usb cable moved the camera slightly. I will look soon into posted solutions

And in all it's glory...

So general feeling after assembly
Very satisfactory to build!
The spectrometer is more "intuitive" and demanded me less thinking and back and forth between the website, the written instructions and trying figuring it out

The spectrometer has double walls, I believe the OTK  should too, since it is as likely to experience light beatings## 

The camera could have a more stable place, I will try to place it between two wood sticks (popsicle) or maybe something else

One question I have is if some oil is accidentally in contact with the OTK, could there be a way to wipe it out, change parts, or use materials that won't be affected? Would soap or a specific not too toxic solvent be used?


Thanks!
