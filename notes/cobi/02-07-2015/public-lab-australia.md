### Update: [publiclab.org/wiki/australia](http://publiclab.org/wiki/australia) now exists :) 

###What I want to do
Be part of an Australian chapter of Public Lab! 

###My attempt and results
I just sent an email to the main Public Lab email list, and created this for documenting plans:
http://pad.publiclab.org/p/auslaunch

###Questions and next steps
Next step is to see the current Public Lab community response and what happens at the upcoming discussion in Melbourne

###Why I'm interested
Because it relates to many [things I'm involved with](http://cobismith.com/about/), and I think Public Lab is great.
