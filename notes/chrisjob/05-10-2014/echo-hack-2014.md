I calibrated and tested a DIY made spectrometer

I used a florescent light bulb to calibrate my spectrometer and then captured the spectra outside my widow (see image attached)...

I not too sure how to interpret the spectra even after reading the site: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_lines, 

https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/26920

Can anyone take a look and share what they observe??
