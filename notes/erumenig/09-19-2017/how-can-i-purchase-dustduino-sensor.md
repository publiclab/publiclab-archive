Dear,  
My name is Eduardo and I am an active mobility student in São Paulo, Brazil. In my research, I analyze the concentration of particulate matter in different urban areas. Thus, I would need a portable sensor - preferably low cost - to measure the concentration of air pollution, and DustDuino would be perfect. So could you offer some information on how I could produce or buy this particulate material sensor?  
  
Thanks and best regards,  
Eduardo.
