[PowrPlnt](https://powrplnt.org/) in collaboration with the [Tech Learning Collective](https://techlearningcollective.com) presents:

_Introduction to Writing Your Own Website in HTML and CSS_!

This workshop, based on the Tech Learning Collective's intensive [WEB101 course](https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/web101.html),
is a practical introduction to the basics of creating Web sites of any 
size, from personal blogs to full-fledged Web applications. No prior 
experience in Web design is assumed, but even experienced "front-end 
designers" will leave with a better understanding of what Web sites are 
really made of:

> The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the de-facto 
> standard for publishing information online, a kind of digital equivalent
> to learning to read and write. Why, then, is it so rarely explained in 
> terms of the _language_ that it actually is? What is HTML's 
> grammar, where do HTML "sentences" begin and end, and how is meaning 
> represented in its elements? You don't need a computer science degree to
> learn a foreign language, and that includes HTML.
> 
> This workshop is designed for anyone who ever wanted to toy with HTML
> once or twice, whether it was in the 90's or just last week. Based on a
> portion of the [Tech Learning Collective's WEB101 course](https://techlearningcollective.com/courses/web101.html),
> it is a remarkably thorough treatment of some of the Web's most 
> powerful and most-often overlooked parts. Covering the structure of HTML
> and extending to the richness of semantic data formats like [Microdata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_%28HTML%29) and [RDFa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa),
> learn how to write in the Web's native language so that both humans 
> (like your friends and comrades) and machines (like Google!) can find, 
> use, and most importantly _understand_ what you're saying.
