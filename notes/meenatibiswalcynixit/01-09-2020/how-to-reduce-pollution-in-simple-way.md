1\. When purchasing a new car, consider one that is the most efficient,

lowest-polluting vehicle or even a zero-emission electric car.

2\. Walk or ride a bike when possible.

3\. Take public transportation.

4\. Organize and condense errands into one trip.

5\. When driving, accelerate gradually and obey the speed limit.

Reduce the number of trips you take in your car.

Reduce or eliminate fireplace and wood stove use.

Avoid burning leaves, trash, and other materials.

Avoid using gas-powered lawn and garden equipment.
