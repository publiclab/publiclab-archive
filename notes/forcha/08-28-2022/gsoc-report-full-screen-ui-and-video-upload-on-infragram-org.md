## **Overview : Full-screen UI and video upload on [Infragram.org](http://Infragram.org)**

Infragram enhances environmental research capacity by providing a convenient and low cost method to monitor plant health.

During the GSOC2022 period I worked on.

- Delivering video file to the the WebGL texture for analysis.
- Added multiple resolution selection functionality on webcam streams, video files and Image files.
- Included Video controls (pause, play and sleek ) to manage and regulate video files during analysis.
- Added webcam streaming functionality on IOS browsers (Chrome and Safari ).
- Added functionality to record current analysis and download video file locally.
- Included and perform testing on the Infragram User Interface

For more understanding here is my [GSOC propoal](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/rP8hthBg) and [milistone/planning issue](https://github.com/publiclab/infragram/issues/418)

###**Delivering video file to the the WebGL texture for analysis** ( Process Video File Locally)

- **Problem:** The was no option for users to monitor plant health from video files as the previous Infragram could only handle Images and Webcam streams.
- **Solution:** ![image description](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24577149/187096890-986dca75-f87a-4a46-bd04-3174d031e537.png)
- Initialized getusemedia API for streaming video file.
- Add functionality to upload video file and append to DOM
- Differentiated between video and Image files.
- Passed Video to WebGL texture for processing.

###**Added multiple resolution selection functionality on webcam streams, video files and Image files**

-** Problem:** A low resolution video file or Camera stream provides less details. Hence the vegetative analysis will fall on an inaccurate margin.

- Solution:

Allow selection of multiple video resolutions

- Defined standard resolution attributes of canvas height and width QVGA (300 x 200) , VGA (800 x 600), HD (1920 x 1080) and FULL HD (7680 x 4320).
- Set CSS styling of canvas element at a constant 800 x 600\.
- Added function to adjust HTML width and height attributes of canvas by user selected resolution.

###**Included Video controls (pause, play and sleek ) to manage and regulate video files during analysis.**

-** Problem:** Due to the addition of our new video processing functionality. There exist a need to regulate the current file under analysis.

-**Solution:**

With the help of video controls (play , pause and sleek) our problem can easily be solved.

- Created CSS styling for Sleek bar and play/Pause buttons.
- Get current video time frame and attached it to sleek bar progress.
- Attached video pause and play events to existing video file and play /pause buttons.
- Added toggle functionality between pause and play buttons to improve user experience.

###**Added webcam streaming functionality on IOS browsers (Chrome and Safari )**

-**Problem:** Previous WebRTC Adapter does notsupport webcam streaming on ios versions greater than 13.0.

-** Solution: ** ![image description](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24577149/188118409-13051ac1-c067-4dca-b605-96d68bb2ca0b.png)

- Use MediaDevices.getUserMedia() API to enable webcam streaming on IOS chrome and IOS safarri.
- Use Infagram versioning to ensure compatibility between the new and old interfaces/features

###**Added functionality to record current analysis and download video file locally.**

-**Problem:** There was a need to save the current analysis for future use.

-**Solution:** Record the canvas texture and download.

###**Included and perform testing on the Infragram User Interface**
- **Problem:** We had to ensure that the Infragram UI works exactly as indented.
-**Solution:**

##Outcome:
Infragram users (IOS inclusive) can upload videos while selecting the desired resolution for plant health analysis. The converted video can be downloaded and stored locally for future reference.

##What is left
- Include Canvas Zooming and Panning
- Add file Drag and Drop functionality
 
##**Thank You**
This work would have not been possible without the support and constructive advice  of public lab's research director @warren. Many thanks to outreachy intern @@stefq1111  for designing a user mobile friendly user interface. Finally , thanks to @@mathildaudufo and @cess at the public lab community and everyone else who helped out.
