## Project description

This project aims at improving the User Interface at [Infragram.org](http://Infragram.org) by fixing some known bugs and implementing various features like cross-browser drag-and-drop, Full Screen mode enhancement, Video NDVI analysis, and some UI improvements.

Abstract/summary (<20 words):

### Problem

_What problem(s) does your project solve?_

After doing some research in the current Infragram UI I concluded some of the following problems.

1. **No option to close WebCam input**: There is no available option to turn off the Infragram Web Camera. _This overloads the internal buffer memory and may cause a time lag between reading and releasing the input feed.![image description](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24577149/157638941-8f984ec8-fa5b-4647-90e6-fa7aacae01e6.png)_
2. **Front Camera does not mirror**: \_ The video stream of the front camera is not filpped , this causes a lot of confusion as most users are versed with the mirror feel of a front camera.![image description](/i/45612.png "157654718-95310b6f-3dc0-41da-a3c3-b1039910e10b.png")
3. **No image/video file filters on Infragram's file input**: This leads user uncertainty to the functionality of the infrared analysis. ![image description](/i/45613.jpg "imgpture.JPG")
4. **The full screen icon is made invisible** whenever an image is set for analysis. This makes it difficult to identify the button required for full screen mode. ![image description](/i/45614.jpg "infrapture.JPG")
5. **No functionality is provided to** **exit the Infragram full screen display**. This makes the interface suboptimal and reduces user engagement.
6. **Absence of images to help people** **chose the right filter** to assist users in choosing the right image on the presets modal. In regards to this [Issue #226 ](https://github.com/publiclab/infragram/issues/226) ![image description](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24359/158415823-4c9ae0b0-0ad0-4ee0-9fa9-7048f390034a.png)

### Experience

I am currently a 6th-year student at University of Buea, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Cameroon, and have been doing web development right from the second year of my college. I have worked on projects based on JavaScript, React, and Ruby.

---------

### Teamwork

Well Regarding Public Lab, I have gained a lot of experience and guidance from every member of the PublicLab especially @mathildaudufo and Working in Public Lab has been a great journey for me till now and I hope the same for the future as well.

---------

### Passion

My friends and I are currently working on a water sanitary evaluation project. Infragram made us realize that the using infrared to calculate the NDVI of the vegetation surrounding each water source, we would have an estimate to the degree of pollution to that water source . With knowledge of of how well the vegetation appears, we can mark a water source as pure or harmful. Not only has this project brought us insight , it has also improved my heath as I now only consume vegetables based on their Infragram analysis.

### Audience

_This_ project will ease the process of researchers and curious people alike who are involved with using Infragram as a platform to analyse their plant health to draw some meaningful insights out of their analysis. Furthermore, It will be an honor to implement added
features which will make the Infragram experience more enjoyable and intuitive for
all that use it.

### Commitment

I don't have particular conflicting schedule in the
period of GSoC and I can work full-time.
