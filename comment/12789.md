the 2G data is awesome!
a method that can avoid 3rd party services like twilio is text to email, which at least in the US is a basic function on at least ATT and T-mobile networks.  SMS data rates are horrible, so the 2G is probably a better option:

of course, some way to automatically check an e-mail is required.  One nice thing is that text to email also works as email to text, potentially a way of sending info downstream to the device.
