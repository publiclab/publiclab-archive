Hi there! At [@GreenMap](/profile/GreenMap), we made a how to video on bike tours - in English - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-O-es1bkI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-O-es1bkI) and in Chinese - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVC3nAER0lk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVC3nAER0lk) - 

We also made a video on preparedness by bike - http://GreenMap.org/bikeready 
This page has Spanish, Chinese and Japanese versions, plus some research on bike-based responsiveness
