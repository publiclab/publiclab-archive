Cool - just quick response to limitations, you can also run the gem locally with fewer restrictions, i believe: https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter-exporter, maybe some lines here could be made over-ridable: https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter-exporter/blob/c767780392342c109b26a887971b3ab6bcd98c94/lib/mapknitterExporter.rb#L10 (please open an issue in that repo if you're interested) -- but that's in the Ruby version, not image sequencer. I think 200mb files are probably just too big for this approach -- can you work from tiles instead? https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-tile-filter is based around the idea of on-the-fly filtering of tilesets, rather than brute-force converting entire geotiffs.
