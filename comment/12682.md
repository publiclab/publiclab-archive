I like this idea a lot, [@DavidMack](/profile/DavidMack).  One thing we've been talking about on staff is developing a sort of environmental monitoring guide, one section of which would include a table to help choose a method based on all the things you listed and things like support network and tool performance longevity.  In addition to having the 1-10 scale, including a table with real data (e.g. accuracy and precision based on a standard reference material (if applicable) and n>10 independent measurements, or something like that) would be useful too.  

I wonder if the method (and I agree, method makes more sense than tool) categorization should be separate from this sort of guide though.  While I think the ease of use is extremely important to communicate, it is a separate issue from the data quality potential for a given method.  That said, ease of use and long-term in-field performance would strongly affect the kind of sampling campaign that would be possible, which would impact the kind of study it could be used to conduct, so maybe they do all belong in one document.  Food for thought.
