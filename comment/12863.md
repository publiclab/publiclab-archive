Great, thanks for the feedback -- I added some of your notes to [@tonyc](/profile/tonyc)'s note on a redesign of the camera mounting: http://publiclab.org/notes/tonyc/10-14-2015/prototyping-flat-pack-version-of-desktop-spectrometer#c12862

Also, SWB 2.0 doesn't include a rewrite of the capture interface (maybe 2.1? hopefully!) so it's only in the analysis pages.
