I have used Ned's plugin for Fiji (https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/01-13-2016/packaged-photo-monitoring-plugins-available-on-the-github-repositoy) to convert an NGB video into NDVI. See this note: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/06-05-2013/bee-movie-ii. This will work for RGN videos too.

Fiji allows videos to be opened as a stack of individual frames. Then the Photomonitoring plugin can convert each frame into NDVI and Fiji can output a video from the stack.
