[@warren](/profile/warren), [@stoft](/profile/stoft), no, your point was not missed, a ruler measurement of notation such as 2.034685 would be irrelevant, since 4685 would be quite difficult to measure on a practical scale of any sort. "my" point was, only that there is a time to split a hair and then there is just a time to let it go.
