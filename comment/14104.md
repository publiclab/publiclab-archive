Well Dave, I'm just going to have to disagree with you on this one, look, it's an excel program, one of many developed by Thomas C O'Haver, a gentleman with a Ph,D., in Analytical chemistry here are references for his qualifications- https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~toh/
Ph.D., Analytical Chemistry, 1968, Univ. of Florida (J. D. Winefordner)
B.S. Chemistry, 1963, Spring Hill College 

So please check it out for yourself, if I make mistakes I certainly correct them but if there is knowledge to be had, I am not just willy-nilly about it either. I go to sources where they are tried and true. what about my Rhodamine B experiments or Eosin Y? I'm doing those as my first
 fluorescent experiments because there are NIST standards already done on them with various regents, thay way I can calibrate my own rig and fine tune my technique, and so far I'm gettting pretty close to those standards, so I must be doing something right.

I know you did a similar piece of work on SNR, and that's fine, I just think there is a lot more to spectrometry than shinning a laser or CFL down the photon tube. I'd like to see more of your work on the fluorescence side of all this, I've never seen any spectra uploaded by you, just the work you do on matlab?

Anyway Dave, have a good day.
