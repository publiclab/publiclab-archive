Yeah, my software ended with Fortran, many years ago.  But if you get into the discussions, following the post, of how windows11 decided that they were going to use only " cleaned up " drivers.  That is ( I think)the discussion of " wrappers".  Which leaves older drivers, like rtlsdr, in a bad place.  If someone else can help fill in, it would be appreciated.
