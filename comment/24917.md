Here's the most recent version of the Papercraft Spectrometer, v2.0.8. This version includes more simplified text, updated links, and a second page of the PDF. 

Printing the two pages as a double-page on a single piece of cardstock will print a black box on the reverse (so the inside of the spectrometer is black and less reflective) and includes a template for cutting out the slit.
