[@justin](/profile/justin) - Many thanks for the great efforts you made in getting leaflet.illustrate to this point. I have 2 implementation questions, if you don't mind?

I'm using L.Illustrate.Create.Textbox and L.Illustrate.textbox in a command chain in order to implement my own maptool. Once I persist the Textbox created by L.Illustrate.textbox, I would like to be able to reconstruct an entire L.Illustrate.Textbox (from a database), and redisplay it on a map -- I'm close, but no cigar yet.

In reconstructing the textbox, I can:
   1) successfully call L.Illustrate.textbox to create a L.Illustrate.Textbox (let's call it tb), 
   2) create a divIcon and set it to tb["options"]["icon"]

the but when I call L.Illustrate.Textbox.setContent(), the call stack fails because the icon has no children:
    (leaflet.illustrate.js:455): Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'children' of undefined

My first question - is there any other way to have the div icon correctly initalised?
My second question - have you made any progress in being able to shrink the textarea when zooming out?

My huge thanks in advance,
Donovan
