[@rmeister](/profile/rmeister) -- WebJack is a lovely piece of work!

I connected a thermistor to a Pro Mini, used the voltage divider and capacitor setup recommended above, and it all worked very easily, using your nice sketch examples and the very clean demo code.

I'll be posting about this soon, but I used the rickshaw.js graphing library to get scrolling sensor readings -- below, you can see me holding the the thermistor, then putting it in some ice water, then taking it out and warming it up again ...

Cheers, and thanks!
