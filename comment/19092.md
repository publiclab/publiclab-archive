[@stevie](/profile/stevie) - maybe this could at some point be a good kit for students to use? Pretty cool, [@MadTinker](/profile/MadTinker) !!

Does this confirm [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)'s thought that `this and other sensors which purport to report Total Dissolved Solids are just conductivity sensors ` -- or just that TDS and conductivity are directly related?
