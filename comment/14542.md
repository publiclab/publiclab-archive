hey  viechdokter, the "scratched off" ccd screen, is the color film on the sensor's surface, very tricky and very risky to attempt it, but what happens is yes, there will be a little more resolution but it will be in monochrome (black and white.) usually people will do that when they are taking long time exposure photos of the cosmos!

I have a NexImage5 ccd sensor camera which I use for this purpose but I would never remove the color layer just to get a few more pixels of resolution.
