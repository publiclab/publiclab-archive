Yeah, that would totally be an approach (and an affordable one, with ~$20 for kit plus 6 x $7 for tubes), but those tubes are not as formaldehyde-specific as you'd hope. The chemicals covering the beads would really react with any aldehyde or ketone, with varying reaction speeds due to things like steric hindrances, making it a non-quantitative option. We tested the tubes against the EPA method that quantifies formaldehyde, acetone, and acetaldehyde in a sample, and verified that the tubes do indeed react with those other co-contaminants: https://publiclab.org/notes/gretchengehrke/10-07-2015/formaldehyde-measurement-testing-public-lab-s-kit-with-doh-s-equipment
