Thanks xose!
I love that setup, it looks so rugged!

I've been doing some research on how to power the pi with solar. Is the plaque in the upper right corner the solar panel?

Looking at the Witty Pi it looks useful for scheduling shutdowns and power ups but my question is really about using a battery and keeping it charged. Did Witty Pi provide this or did you use a solar charge controller of some kind?

For our use we don't need to shut the Pi down as we hope to use motion detection.

Would a standalone solar power bank work? One can get them up to 30000mAh. I guess they power off?

Thanks for your advice, excited to follow and share!

Our immediate use is for community security but we'd love to use them for wildlife photography as well!
