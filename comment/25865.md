there may be some answers for you in the research notes produced by [@Stoft](/profile/Stoft) and [@Warren](/profile/Warren) on the topic of camera's native  resolution and optics as a guide look at the the plab spectromer V3.0 specifications, camera used especially the 8, 16 megapixel and higher 8 bit cameras as SBW does not use the available native pixel width in its calculations the f3.5 refers to the light gathering properties i.e. an f2.0 lens is much better than a n f3.5  depending on which light levels you are operating in. plse check the research notes for more in depth info.
