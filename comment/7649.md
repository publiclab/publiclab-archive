Hi Ned,
I am happy to know there is interest and technical/mechanical aspects is definitely what I am missing :) would be great to learn more on the context of what you do in conservation planning process and see how we can continue this discussion further. Do you have some research notes on this?
btw, in terms of human-cultural input to conservation, this might be a bit far off, but do you know this work by Jerome Lewis and the Extreme Citizen Science people in UCL, on Pygmies monitoring logging activities and other damages to wild life and forests in Congo: http://uclexcites.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/participatory-mapping-in-congo-brazzaville-part-1/
