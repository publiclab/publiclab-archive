Ah, might be fun to look into adjustable ones too, yeah ... these seem to be so cheap because they're appropriate for charging cell phones  ... sometimes the specs on these things are a little loose -- "5V" might actually mean 5V plus a little ... might be worth ordering a couple of these just to see if they work well enough ...
