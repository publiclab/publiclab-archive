Juanjo,

That's some impressive assembly improvisation. Sorry about the missing ring but your hose ring should work just as well. I think I should modify the model for the camera tray so those two holes are already present, but you demonstrated that you don't even need a drill to make the holes.

I look forward to seeing your aerial photos if you get any wind. And it would be great to hear about that crazy looking kite.

Chris
