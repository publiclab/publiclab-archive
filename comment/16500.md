OK, so for the UI, there's a lot going on here, and I think we may want to start with one thing at a time, rather than trying to do all the UI work up front. I'm thinking, for example, about the `suggestion` selector as you've shown it -- how do we know what the suggested change applies to? Would the user select text? 

How about having `suggest` be an alternative to editing, rather than commenting. That way, suggestions could be posed as a change to the entire subsection -- and to view a suggestion, you'd see a `diff`? So to propose one, you get an editor just as you would the usual inline editor, but you'd have either "Save" or "Suggest changes" -- that way there'd be fewer interface options too, since they'd share the pencil button. 

What do you think?
