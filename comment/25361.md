I had the same exact problem with my PMS 7003 sensor! I was getting suspiciously high particulate matter readings on a very clear day. I found this article after some googling so I decided to clean the sensor. After prying the case open I found a tiny spider's nest in the corner of the pcb! You can see the nest in the left of the pcb, just above the fan in my photo. After wiping down the pcb and the sensor everything is working normally again. Thanks for this helpful article.
