Hi folks, I'm late to this comment thread, but am really excited about it. I generally want to support and echo many of [@stoft](/profile/stoft)'s comments, particularly "The objective is not exclusivity or elitism but to raise the bar of aspiration toward better science and train those who aspire but do not yet understand. When there are anomalies, then deal with them openly; otherwise, get the job done and spend most of the effort to support the enthusiastic contributors to learn and contribute more science" which is also in line with some of [@fastie](/profile/fastie)'s and [@warren](/profile/warren)'s visions for peer review in Public Lab. I wholeheartedly agree with this and think that framing peer review in a capacity-building sense, making "teachable moments" are core piece of the review process.  What would you all think about a process like this: 

* People self-identify their note type / intent (because, [@viechdokter](/profile/viechdokter), I do think intent matters and helps people know what kind of feedback is useful -- is this a fun idea where you don't necessarily want feedback on rigor? are you trying to identify chemical interferences and you want nitty-gritty detail questions? etc) 

* People self-identify if they want peer-review, and if so their note is marked "research-grade draft"

* The peer-review process is transparent and includes constructive criticism, and numerical ranking for a rubric of factors 

* If necessary, the author implements the changes they deem necessary and sends back to review for an updated numerical rubric 

* The note is then published as reviewed research-grade, with the post-review rubric at the bottom of it, and a link to the draft and first-draft rubric. That way, the final version is most visible, but the draft and review can be used as learning opportunities for anyone. 

I'd like to see perhaps two bins on the dashboard: reviewed research notes, and general research notes. I don't think you should have to specifically search for reviewed notes (as I think I interpreted from one of [@david-days](/profile/david-days)' comments), because that likely wouldn't be apparent to newcomers. I'd like a place for all research notes, but a visible distinction for those that have been reviewed.
