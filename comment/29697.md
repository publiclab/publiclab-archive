    Microplastic intrusion into the human body can occur in ways other than just drinking or eating food with microplastics in them. According to an experiment by Dr. Rick Smith, microplastics can make their way into our system by just using plastic products. Dr. Smith drank water and ate from plastic bottles and containers, used plastic utensils and clothes, and just overall surround himself with more plastic. These microplastics can have drastic affects on our bodies too. Some microplastics are found to be smaller than 100 microns, which is small enough for them to be carried by the blood and eventually deposit in other organs, even the brain. The chemicals that are used to make plastics could also cause harm, but there isn't much research on them yet.
