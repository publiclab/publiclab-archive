Approaching the cite of where we were going to be collecting microplastics, I noticed there was a lot of trash and unexpected debris. There were many plastic bottles and food wrappers. I think that it will take hundreds of years to disintegrate, and then my not even completely be gone. This pollution is effecting the animals in the ecosystem, and could be adding more impurities to the water that supplies the community.
