 > I like your thinking on infrastructure (like the spam dashboard) to manage and coordinate the community of translators + reviewers, and I totally appreciate that more of a 'system' would help! I wonder, though, if we could use the topic/group infrastructure of PublicLab.org itself rather than build a new dashboard. For example, https://publiclab.org/wiki/translation lists some activities, and we could think about recruiting people to follow the Translation /topic/ at https://publiclab.org/tag/translation to get involved. We could make the wiki page the "dashboard" perhaps? I'm just thinking about how to be judicious in creating new systems that would have to be maintained as well.

I have added a section "Reusing existing infrastructure to make a Dashboard-like setup "  where I have proposed how we can reuse the existing infrastructure to design a Recruitment Dashboard.

> I love that you've mapped out the recruitment flows. It'll be great to think about where the "roadblocks" are and to ensure for example that people who don't have GitHub accounts are supported. You can see a bit of this happening already at https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/9481 but most translators/reviewers may not even be familiar with what GitHub is!

I have added a list of some roadblocks I feel we can work on.

> We might have a test page with a variety of HTML content in it, which we attempt to run the translation helper on, and to write a test around this?

I have added a suggestion in "Improving Translation Helper" about a sandbox-type page where all new changes can be seen and tests can be written to compare helper functions.
