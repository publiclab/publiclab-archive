Excited to see that step too.

Maybe it's just me, but I do wonder what it would look like with a color range from -1 to 0 being grayscale, and 0 to +1 being a gradient from blue to red, or more of a rainbow. This is the kind of thing itd be really neat to see with an web-based image compositor... we could choose different gradients and so forth.
