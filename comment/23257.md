I spoke with the Ontario Ministry of the Environment District office in Sarnia today. Sarnia is the middle of the chemical valley and refineries in Canada are surprisingly not as tightly regulated as in the US (so the levels are on average higher). I thought they might have some particular insight into this issue. Here are the handheld monitors that they use:

Eagle 2 for SO2

H2S UltraRae 3000 for vocs and benzene
