I'm becoming familiar with the MeteoMex suite of sensors from [@robert_winkler](/profile/robert_winkler) that includes tVOC monitoring and could serve as a low-cost place to start investigating. There's not so much about these sensors on Public Lab yet, but you can read more about them here: http://www.meteomex.com and see an [example output here.](http://www.meteomex.com:8080/dashboard/cbde9020-2f3e-11ea-a96e-c3dba8703f6d?publicId=e96f3c70-2f4d-11ea-a96e-c3dba8703f6d)
