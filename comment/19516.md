Thank you for the kind words! I was very impressed with some of your posts on microscopy!
The two resources I personally like best are the openCV tutorials and PyImageSearch.
https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.0/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html

https://www.pyimagesearch.com/ [Try looking at the older content to begin with, as he now works a lot on ML/AI].
