Hi Warren,
Thanks for your concern-the carbon arc you show in that video is quite a bit larger than what I had in mind but yes that sort of spark gap arrangement.
The spark gap power supply is painful but not deadly, there is also the obvious danger of Lead poisoning.
Yes I am aware of the visible emission spectra of Lead in a flame or arc.
I have no links or references to base research on.
I have experience with UV/Vis spectro's but never done any flame emission, but I am confident a low cost method can be devised.
