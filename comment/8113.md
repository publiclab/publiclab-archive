Hi Adresc4 - I'll try to help you get the plugin working. When you are running Fiji and you click on menu bar Plugins => Photo Monitoring do you see these four plugins listed:
Create dual image list
Dual image NDVI processing
Single image NDVI from directory
Single image NDVI from displayed image

If you click on "Dual image NDVI processing" you should see the second dialog window that Chris posted. If that's not working please let me know.
