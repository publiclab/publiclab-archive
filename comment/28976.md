Healthy Gulf does advocacy work on the dead zone: https://www.healthygulf.org/our-work/protecting-water-2/the-dead-zone. [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic), is this problem gaining more attention with other researchers or agencies?

Also looks like the UN has a current initiative called "[Global Action to Protect the Marine Environment from Land-Based Pollution](https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/oceans-seas/what-we-do/addressing-land-based-pollution/global-action-protect-marine)"
