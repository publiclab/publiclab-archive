It is possible to do less downsampling. Hopefully this'll be part of hte Capture page refresh. Originally it wasn't a high priority since it was already way past the expected resolution of the device. Now, people are challenging that assumption :-)

Yep!! Not retroactively, however. But really, many things we do in the software will "improve" the hardware. Such as noise reduction, or baselining, or autodetection of calibration lights, HDR compensation for overexposure, etc. One great thing about doing a combined hardware/software platform.
