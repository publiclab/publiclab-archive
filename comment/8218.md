I wanted to work off of the actual models (or prototype models) Mathew and others made, but didn't have time to do a scaled model. Also, figuring out the geometry and scaling it are separate problems (at least how my brain works) but you're right and Sketchup can help us simply scale this design. It'll also take some "wall sealing" to give the model volume.

Some thoughts on an SLR adaptor, which could be useful to attach sample containers to also: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-20-2013/proposal-slr-spectrometer-attachment
