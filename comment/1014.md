cool!  the 6v signal isn't a problem for the cameras? USB is usually 5v or lower. if there's a problem, you could put a few diodes in the line to drop the voltage (dirty, inefficient method, but convenient).

makes me want to pull out [my 555](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/mathew/8-5-2011/adjustable-555-based-shutter-trigger-circuit) and get cracking again!
