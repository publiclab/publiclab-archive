**Is this your conclusion or do we have to test lots of other materials that commonly show up in the NDVI images we take? **  I have looked at a lot of spectra and didn't see many cases where a blue filter would be a better choice than a red filter. It would be good to hear from other folks about exceptions. I'm sure there are exceptions but for my interests the ability of a red filter to more easily distinguish between healthy and less-healthy vegetation is important. My results indicate you are getting higher precision with a red filter than with a blue filter in detecting plant stress. 

**Is a red filter always going to give better NDVI results with the surfaces common in aerial or other photos?** Probably not but for my interests it's unlikely that I care. If a roof produces NDVI similar to healthy vegetation I'm not going to be too worried. NDVI is a tool that is reasonably good at detecting plant stress and a few other things but it's not an all purpose tool. 

**How often will a blue filter give similar or better results?** Twice
