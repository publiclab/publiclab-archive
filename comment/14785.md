I have a similar camera in my spectrometer and was having the same light spot interfering and showing up in the spectral data, I had to bring mine down to 29 deg angle to avoid it, and it works. Now you may be able to use it with it at it's present upright angle if the mirror angle is correct, but I can almost guarantee with the fish eye effect there will be a slight distortion of the diffracted light.
