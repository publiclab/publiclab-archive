Yes - I think to some extent all tools should probably be designed for learners. But certain very large and very flexible tools are bad/intimidating for beginning learners but great for more experienced users (I'm thinking of things like GIS software for mapping or Photoshop for graphics or Tableau in the data realm). One of the things we've been thinking about is how to scaffold people to learn the terminology and process and some of the inner workings related to data so that they can "graduate" to the flexible/complex tools that can make many kinds of outputs. And there's always design decisions for how much of the "inner workings" the learner actually needs to learn versus what can be productively hidden for reasons of simplicity and focus. 

And yes - I think purple or hot pink would have to be the next tool color :D
