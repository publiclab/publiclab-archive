I ordered a couple of these, they seem pretty intuitive. This website has a good bit of information on it in terms of the kits, and radon in general: https://sosradon.org/test-kits. Basically, there are two options, the short term testing kit ($15 and tests for 2-4 days) and the long term one ($25 and tests for 3-12 months). Both are good, but they mention the long term one as being more effective in catching radon over time (makes sense!). However, if you need some fast answers, that's why they have the short term ones (for example when you're about to buy a home). Both would need to be sent back to the lab for analysis, but that cost is included in the purchase. One thing I didn't find on the website that I was interested in was the shelf life of these kits. I called, and they said these ones last for 10 years. Pretty good since it sounds like some of the others on the market only last for 3. 

One other note on the short term ones is that they need to get back to the lab within 10 days of testing for them to run results.
