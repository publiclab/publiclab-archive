Ohh I understand. Ok I might get this wrong (I'm still new to the science) but we were using the mineral oil as a sort of base sample. We know how much it fluoresses on its own (not much) and then we can tell our samples on top of it. So when we mix the oils in (which are often solid) we should be able to ID the oil. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
