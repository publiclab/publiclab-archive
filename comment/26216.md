This is a really interesting question, and it led me to look more into the use of face masks in disease prevention. The CDC has prepared t[his page with information on the transmission for this novel coronavirus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html), but there's still a lot left to figure out.

It's worth noting that the coronavirus is really really small-- current estimates give it a diameter of just 1.2 microns. For context, average water filters are typically in a range of 5-50 microns and the large N95 respirators (like a firefighter might wear) can only filter out particles larger than 3 microns. So creating a filter small enough to prevent passage of the virus itself would be quite tough.

Where face masks seem to make an impact is in reducing the number of times a person touches their mouth or nose which can help prevent any viruses on the hands from entering the body. This effect could theoretically be replicated by anything worn over the mouth, such as a scarf or ski mask.

There are some DIY emergency air filters out there, s[uch as this one made with t-shirts](https://totobobo.com/blog/2015/10/project-oxygen-water-bottle-air-filter). It is designed to filter out air pollution. In it's current design, this one wouldn't be able to keep the very small virus from entering the filtered air, but
