When our project was still a hand-populated circuit boards + ball of wires, I first found publiclab.org.  I totally loved the spectral workbench.  It made me think maybe, just maybe, when we made a 'real' fluorometer (ie not ball of wires), we could have such a database, so I emailed Jeff who's name I found somewhere, thinking there was a 10% chance I'd get a response and a 1% chance I'd get the chance to pick his brain, but BOOM! two days later we had a 45 minute conversation which helped inform our own development of online platform we ended up building.

It shows just how much collaboration is baked into public lab and what happens when collaboration is an ethic not just a side-note.
