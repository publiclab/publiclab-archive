Hi  viechdokter,

These are great observations. They reveal important features of spectra created using consumer cameras as the detector. It's really interesting that your camera decides to output gray when all three channels are saturated. I never noticed cameras doing that. It would be good to know what camera you are using and what automatic or manual camera settings you are using (white balance, exposure). Other details about the spectrometer (grating, slit width, dimensions) would also be helpful.

Thanks,
Chris
