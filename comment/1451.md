Hi Fernando, 

Glad to hear that you've read through the documentation on H2S thus far. Have you seen some of the research notes detailing the process that people like "megan" "eustatic" "shannon" and "sara" are writing? These give a good idea of the initial part of the process. If you want to provide a bit of an idea about the project you have in mind for working on the H2S tools, we could also give you more specific ideas about process.

There are also a few people on the Public Lab listserve that have been talking about both the photostrip test and developing a sensor. Are you part of the list? If not, it would probably be helpful for you in following the conversation to join.

In terms of linking to Public Lab on your website, please feel free to do so. 

Thanks, Shannon
