warren, I will most absolutely share whatever I come up with. I was actually having trouble using the browser version with my mac. Also, in Max, you can do some live analysis on the image as it comes in, where as the browser can only provide a static image to analyze.

mathew, I had not considered that. That may be part of why it never seemed to process properly. I'm still just trying to figure out how to layer the channels to satisfy the formula. Did you work with (Near IR - Red) / (Near IR + Red) in your go at it?
