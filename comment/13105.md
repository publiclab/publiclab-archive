The dowel is just a birch dowel, cheap as they come. But the design case was to have everything ship in a standard kit box, so the pendulum is built out of 9" segments of this dowel, held together by PVC flexible tubing joint, pinned in place with simple thumb tacks.

the result is stronger than you'd think, since it can flex at the joint. Thrown the thing around with weight attached and it whips, but doesn't break, even on impact.

The stopper pressed into the neck makes a very strong connection, one that is actually difficult to remove. I think this has a lot to do with the particular rubber it's made of, likely won't work with the firmer white rubber ones I've seen. To really lock it down, you could just put another stopper on top of the bottle, tapered oppopsite direction

the bigger problem is the pressure on the screen, and directly transfer of force to the screen on impact. Obvious flaw, as well as obscuring the view. The view could be helped by including a clear card to use as protector, but I don't know if this angle is worth persuing.

Totally different approact to this uses nylon threaded rod. This is another material I've been playing with, as it's univerally handy to have the tripod thread rod as part of the mix. Allows you to attach a camera or ball head, or tie in to the mount from the pole mounting kit...

the nylon thread is very strong and flexible. Might be too flexible and introduce wobble.

Thinking a two-hole [#3](/n/3) stopper could allow for interesting pairings of threaded nylon rod with dowel/carbon fiber rigid drops.

My end goal on this is a general purpose DIY suspension kit with all the parts you need to try many configurations, based on notes like these.

So far, all thread, stoppers, rubber bands, dowels, tacks, PVC tubing, tripod ball head, zip ties, string, rigid wire for connection to flying line...what else should be part of a small-parts kit?

assuming soda bottles are already everywhere...
:)

this is a trick I used to keep the all thread rig from bowing under weight of P/S camera, btw
