Recently I've returned to fiddle with pole mapping of gardens, and working on the camera mount, see earlier notes in this thread. I liked the soda bottle rig for kite & balloon mapping because it allowed the camera to adjust to string or pole angle and stay relatively parallel to the ground. Also good was that it had a direct line of support (using rubber bands) for the camera in a face-down-to-the-earth position, as opposed to being cantilevered from the tripod mount that in most cameras is on the bottom (the surface 90 degrees from the lens surface), not the back of the camera (the surface that lies parallel to the lens surface). That may sound confusing, but the cantilevered position is how the camera rig with the pole mapping kit works, and it has to stay rigid to keep the lens somewhat parallel to the ground, not adjusting its position relative to the ground. At least that’s how the kit rigging worked for me.

So the issues to figure out were a rigging that a) allowed the camera to adjust its position relative to the ground, and b) securely held the camera facing down, not cantilevered.
My partner David and I worked out a super basic design and (mostly he) constructed it. We:
•	Found a 3” plate with holes in it at the hardware store to screw onto the hardware of the kit. This is important because it gets the hanging camera far enough away from the pole so that the pole does not interfere with the camera position. I put a small piece of old hose between the plate and the C part of the existing kit hardware so the plate didn’t slip around. Clip the carabiner that came with the kit through the most distal hole on the plate.
•	Cut a piece of scrap 1x down to a square plate not much larger than the camera
•	Took advantage of the headmount for the GoPro camera I’m using, screwing that on to the wood. This makes it super easy to place and remove the camera. Without a headmount option I would use the soda bottle rigging hung from the 3” plate.
•	Placed eye screws in each corner of the plate on the opposite side of the plate from the camera mount. Angled the eyes so anything strung through them would have as little resistance as possible.
•	Threaded a strong string continuously through all eyes and tied it into a loop.
•	Gathered the string between 2 sets of eyes on opposite sides, then looped those on the carabiner hanging from the 3” plate. 

You now have a secure mount that can adjust to the angle of your pole! Let us know how this works if you try it!

Here's the 3" steel plate to extend the camera away from the pole
