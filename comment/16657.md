The lower seal of the camera encasement did get ~24 hours of prolonged exposure (partial submersion) to elevated water volume during last week's heavy rainfall.  This caused water to get into the unit, and also trashed the latest set of photos on the SD.  I had previously angled the unit to get better close-ups of the sedimentation loads.  This naturally

brought the camera into closer stream surface proximity -- apparently too close given the recent flood water.

This trail camera is waterproof under normal circumstances.  In hindsight, I would have pulled the unit just prior the last storm to prevent damage.
