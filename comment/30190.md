Ok. Trying to stay as close to duplicate the original paper as closely as possible.  R.la cera isn't in this area.  But other closely related lichen supposedly do.  First shot is the Fruticose lichens.  No one knows of any close by, but have a lot more work to do on that road.  Found an interesting video on YouTube "Using lichens to determine air quality" by the naturalist.  As for method development.  Looking for possible alternatives to the centrifuge.  Possibly, disposable hplc filters.  Need some help here.  Why are the lichen stored in the dark during the extraction?
