sled kites have that characteristic skittish 'hunting' behavior.  They stabilize well with a drogue on a long string that connects to a bridle on back two tail points.  This pocket sled looks like it already has tails though. 

this is an exciting setup! I love the idea of a completely soft kite kit with a small camera.
