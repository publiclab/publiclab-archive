Yikes, I hadn't seen the pre-built boost converter corner of ebay. That could be the source of all solutions. A lot of those output 5V for charging devices, but the existing SkyShield probably needs 5.5V as a bare minimum (the servos need at least 4.8V and the circuit uses up at least 0.5V). Some of the little boost modules are "adjustable" but that apparently means by replacing a resistor or two on the board. I couldn't find any that do exactly what we need which I think is something like input = 3 to 6V and output = 6V and 1.5A. They must be out there.
