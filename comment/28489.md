Hi [@warren](/profile/warren), 

> Thinking on how people who don't have a github account, or for whom GitHub is an unfamiliar place, might most smoothly navigate this

So the primary way of this whole workflow is everything is automated. What happens when you click the submit button is that, it will call the `github api` and open up an issue for us based on the form data, the community volunteer wouldn't need to do anything, just observe some ticks and maybe animations going 👀. We may need some bot account, say `publiclab-bot` for this.
In case this fails, we can display your suggestion
> copy paste this text into an issue using some template

this sounds great.

Update:

I have attached an updated workflow which may better explain it.

P.s. Thanks a lot for the review, glad you liked it :)
