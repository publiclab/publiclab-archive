Hello [@Akanbifatimah](/profile/Akanbifatimah), thank you for your proposal! I appreciate that you've included both code mockups and visual mockups! Just a few comment and suggestions: 

I wonder if your design could make the image we see edge-to-edge with no margin at all. Or really minimal margin. See how https://photopea.com/ creates a working space that is an edge-to-edge workspace, even vertically it's fixed height. Maybe it would be helpful to see an extra mockup with an image added, so we can see what it will look like and how much extra space there is on each side. Likewise while editing an image, we could skip the footer and just have a completely edge-to-edge interface that is not scrollable. What do you think?

I like the redesign of the front page as well, it looks great!!

Thank you!
