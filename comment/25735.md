Hello [@liz](/profile/liz) thanks for the correction. I'm delighted to meet you. At GearHub we use 3D printing to produced functional 3D STEM Kits for education. This is to help young learners be prepared as the workforce for the future. We believe with 3D printing complexity is free therefore we brace up and started teaching this young generation. In addition we teach Sustainable Development Goals to help refine they thinking and how they can identify the problem.
