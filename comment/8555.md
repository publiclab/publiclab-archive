Roderick, that's a really good point that the two cameras are different models and might be processing the frames differently. Someone also commented that if the two clips are just a tiny bit out of sync they would appear to have strange behavior. So there are a lot of variables to worry about and I have decided not to. Also, I'm almost ready to post about a new dual camera rig design. One every two years seem about right?
