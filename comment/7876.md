Sunwukong, You can download the data from any spectrum at SpectralWorkbench.org. So at this [page for one of the nicer CFL spectra from Ebert](https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/4474), you can get JSON, CSV, or XML data for the intensity per wavelength. You can get the expected wavelengths of the peaks in a CFL at [this Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fluorescent_lighting_spectrum_peaks_labelled.gif). I tried to correct this spectrum to better match the expected wavelengths with a [third order polynomial which you could apply](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/3-6-2013/polynomial) to the data. 

There is a [new macro at SpectralWorkbench](https://spectralworkbench.org/macro/nathanathan/Fastie-emission-absorption-curve) which identifies peaks or valleys in a spectrum. It can be run on any spectrum at SpectralWorkbench. The variables in the macro might need to be manually tweaked to get the best results.
