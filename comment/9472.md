The NIR and visible images look a little different and that could be caused by a few factors. If any of the camera settings change between images it will effect the pixel values in the image. It's best if you can set a specific shutter speed, ISO, aperture, and white balance to improve consistency between photos. Any change in camera settings will change they the image. There can also be bi-directional reflectance (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_reflectance_distribution_function) effects. Using RAW is arguable better but it probably isn't the cause of the effect you are seeing - unless you use auto-white balance and that is changing between images.
If you take images at solar noon you will see another effect called the "hot-spot". You will likely see a shadow of your UAV near the center of the photos and the area around the UAV shadow will appear brighter than other parts of the photos. That's because the hot-spot is an area where shadows cast by objects on the ground a not visible since they are hidden by the object itself. At high sun angles you might also see an area on the photo that is susceptible to specular reflection. That would be obvious if you are flying over water. For aerial photography people tend to prefer moderate sun angles.
This is interesting work and I encourage you to continue writing these notes. Experimenting with different options is a good way to learn.
