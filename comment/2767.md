If you have a chance to upload a photo of the barcode while it's out of the case, that can help us narrow down what's going on.

Once we solve this I'd like to post it as a "common troubleshooting issue" on the wiki... would that be OK? Your photo illustrating the problem is excellent and we can likely show a before/after pair.
