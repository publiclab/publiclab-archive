Hm, can you link to the Ed Mallon comment about square waves? 

Also I see your posts here: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/06-09-2017/the-mini-pearl-logger - exciting too. Great work you're up to! 

I have a wind sensor from AS220 that I could send you if you like. Any interest? https://moderndevice.com/product/wind-sensor-rev-p/

Could be an interesting thing to try with a logger, although it only does speed and not direction. Maybe I should post a question about this. OK, i will. Twist my arm. :-P
