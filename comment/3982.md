I am interested in roughly the same end, but it is not simple to detect these chemicals optically. It can  be done however, by looking at the absorbance  of invisible infrared light or by stimulating the emission of some wavelengths by exciting the sample with others. I have some experience with spectrometry in the context of light measurement and with metrology in general, but I don't know much about chemistry, though I am not too old to learn. 

I just ordered my spectrometer and am looking for other people who want to focus on this application to see if we can find a way to come up with a smart phone you can wave over the veggies at the market to tell if they are fit to eat. I will need a lot of help. I know how to extend the IR range by changing the grating if we need to or change the resolution and all that geeky stuff. 

We all can dream, can't we?
