 Thanks [@warren](/profile/warren) .
Love to interact with fellow folks in Bangalore on Mapknitter and contribute more to this.I am in south Bangalore(Jayanagar )right now
My project details:
Project Idea 1: (currently working on this)
Mapping the Garbage Dump, Garbage Burning in my Local Ward area where 40,000 to 80,000 people reside in. 

Project Idea 2: 
Sun Map to capture the rooftop open areas in each area and chart out the possibility of installing Solar panels as a Community-level Renewable Energy Grid. 
Post mapping, Find dimensions and map weather patterns, the position of the sun in the sky at different times of the year, and shade from nearby obstructions like trees and tall buildings.
