Hi,

There are 2 things which will be a problem while trying to convert the CSS transform into Javascript: 

1) The CSS 3D transform used here: https://github.com/anishshah101/ImageDistortLeaflet/blob/master/imagedistort/imagedistort.js#L93-L97 uses CSS matrix3D transformations for which I couldn't create a javascript alternative. The reason being, I didn't fully understand the math behind it. If we remove the CSS transform then we might have to create a similar function in javascript.

2) A major mistake from my end which I didn't realize until recently, the CSS functions rotate and scale use the center of image as the reference point for these transforms while the ImageDistort function is created keeping an edge point as reference for distortion transform. When we merge them through a common CSS transform so that they run on the same image, the point of reference will remain same for all the transformations so the rotation + scaling will happen about an edge instead of the center. I am unsure as to how this can be sorted.
