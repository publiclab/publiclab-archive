Interesting paper on this same subject.  " Application of Butterfly Pea extract as an indicator of acid - base titrations " by Nyi Mekar Saptarini et. al., Journal of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Research 2015 7(2):275-280.  It also used water extractions and gives very good information on using these flowers for titrations.  No expiration date is given for the solution(not a good sign).
