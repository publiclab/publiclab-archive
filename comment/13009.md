If you use the DS3231 RTC, it has a built-in alarm function that you can use to wake the MCU at a pre-programmed time, allowing you to put the MCU into deep sleep until the interrupt arrives.  Worth noting, the DS1307 (the one that's on the Adafruit logger shield) does not have an alarm.  

Also, I use additional pins as interrupts by simply using the "attach interrupt" function for the pin before going to sleep. The code gets a little tricky because you have to call "detach interrupt" upon waking, then reattach it when you're ready to sleep again.  I'm able to have various inputs wake up my loggers, in addition to the RTC alarm, like tipping bucket rain gages, float switches, etc.
