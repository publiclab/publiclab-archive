Hi Suman,
I haven't really worked on solar hot air balloons for a while. Hot air balloons, and solar hot air balloons especially, are not great for flying on strings. They don't have enough lift to resist even the slightest wind.  it is a good strategy for free flight balloons. 

In terms of balloon fabrication I haven't seen any new developments, but the Aerocene project is making some great strides on flight prediction software:

Pigment:
A solar balloon doesn't need pigment to fly, but the pigment significantly increases solar absorption.  Charcoal will work to get a pale grey color. it needs to be ground very finely.  We did a series of tests back in 2010 of different pigments. The type of charcoal doesn't seem to matter much:

One thing I haven't seen tried-- static charging either the balloon or the charcoal/carbon black particles. This has been suggested a few times. I'm not sure how to do that.

good luck! I hope to see you flying.
