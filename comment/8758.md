Jeff, it seems to me that real-time curvature correction shouldn't be so hard. Estimation of the observed curvature only needs to happen periodically at most (perhaps even once would be sufficient) and should be a pretty simple thing to fit. After that it's just an interpolation problem. You could even leverage WebGL to offload this to the GPU as GPUs are very good at this sort of thing. Really though, I suspect doing it on the CPU would be just fine (although it might chew batteries pretty badly).
