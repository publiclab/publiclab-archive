Hello [@abdul](/profile/abdul), ok, I thoroughly read through your post and your note also, about processing the DVD piece, I want to just start their for a minute, the "purplish" layer that is left  is very inconsequential as it relates to any spectral data collecting. First here is a chart that breaks down the effect that many chemicals and solvents have on various types of plastics:

[![solvent_effects_on_plastics.png](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/857/large/solvent_effects_on_plastics.png)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/857/original/solvent_effects_on_plastics.png)

On the top left of the chart you will see "PC," this is the DVD (polycarbonate) and you will also notice that it is susceptible to damage from various solvents and chemicals. The entire DVD piece can be processed at once, I have made hundreds of them over the months, so I know a little something about this, I process half of the DVD at a time by carefully scoring (using a n Exacto knife or you can use a new razor blade,) to cut around and through the bottom silver strip and top silver strip on the DVD piece.

Take strips of good Duct Tape and firmly adhere it to the half you just scored, and I promise you that, 99% of that purple layer will pull right off along with the aluminum, the rest just don't worry about it, look at the DVD and find the best section of it and cut it out from the bottom up, so you can keep it's curved shape. That's it! 

Ok, all that said, your design is clever, and I understand the reasoning behind it, I particularly was impressed with the use of the protractor to verify the angle of the camera mount. I do have a suggesting though, on the instructions for the DVD piece, I would just keep in mind the chart I provided above, as an aside if you want to keep the part about the optional washing of the DVD piece.

Over all though, without actually testing , it should work, although I will say that its performance will be severely limited in the context of a precision analytical tool, but will do just fine as an excellent learning tool!

I say this, only because alignment and stability are so very critical, I would like to test it out for you if you would like, even in it's present incarnation, I think it will work.

Please let me know?

Best regards,

David H Haffner Sr.
