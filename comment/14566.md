Here is a comparison between the spectral data from the Oregon medical laser center (fluorescein in ethanol) and my spectral data (fluorescein in potassium bromide)

Now here is a comparison of the 2D thermal spectrum, the first one is mine the fluorescein in potassium bromide:

Here is the 2D thermal spectrum of fluorescein in ethanol from the Oregon laser medical center:

as you can see, my thermal image is very similar to the one above, it takes a little more time and effort on my part because I have to do it manually, but the result is a very professional and quality data image.
