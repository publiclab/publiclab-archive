Check out photomultipliers :
"These detectors multiply the current produced by incident light by as much as 100 million times (i.e., 160 dB), in multiple dynode stages, enabling (for example) individual photons to be detected when the incident flux of light is very low. [...] Photomultipliers can be used to detect photons from 115nm to 1700nm. [...] Discover the applications suitable for a :
- photomultiplier, including
- Chemiluminescense detection
- Bioluminescence detection
- Fluorescence detection
- Flow cytometry
- Environmental analyzers
- Non-destructive test and measurement instrumentation
- Photon counting
- Gene chip scanners
- Particle counters
- Spectrophotometry
- Radiation counters and probes
- Surface inspection and laser scanning
- Astronomical instrumentation
- Industrial materials inspection"
