There can be a lot of NIR contamination in the red channel when using RGN filters, especially in bright tropical sun at midday. To get higher NDVI contrast, I usually subtract the blue NIR channel from the red visual channel in Fiji/ImageJ before running the NDVI calculation.

This is on a cheap action camera, maybe compact and DSLR cameras have cleaner sensors.
