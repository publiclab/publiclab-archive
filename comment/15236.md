Hello, Lalith - thanks for your contributions this summer. The under-the-hood changes to enable profile tagging, and the careful thinking on the related location tags system are appreciated. We know this was a complex project, especially with regard to the exact information privacy and user interface surrounding location tagging, and your perseverance is appreciated. 

Will you be able to create a set of `help-wanted` or `first-timers-only` issues including next steps, so that the existing work can be easily built upon by others? 

Thanks again!
