I had a great time and have exciting stuff to post. But I'd like to make a more narrow post about specific techniques; maybe someone else could tackle an overview? My topics of interest are:

* the success of the alcohol/oil dissolving test
* evaporative concentrating techniques
* alcohol dissolves acrylic
* LED cuvette frame development
