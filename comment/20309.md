Yes-- the issue is the lighting, not the magnification. Most plastics are opaque, and the closer you zoom in, the harder it is to identify plastics from non-plastics, so a scope that has an oblique light with relatively low magnification (even x10-25) and high resolution is best from microplastics. (In a traditional lab, we use a dissecting scope rather than a compound scope). There is no lower size limits to microplastics (they go down to the nanoscale), but smaller than 1mm means that visual identification, even with a microscope, is no longer reliable as a source of identification. You'd have to use spectrometry. 
So, yes to the web cam community scope route as a potential step for microplastics.
