Thank you so much for your comments!

**"Please include dates in the timeline so that it will be easier for mentors to review it."**
--- Absolutely, I'll do that right now.

**"Blur your location -> You proposed that it will show some part of the location. Let us say my address is lat:x, lon:y OR ABC Colony, Delhi, India, Asia. As proposed, lat and lon willn't be shown if the location is blurred. I want to know how much precision will be there in the actual address given by the user. Are we taking those addresses into consideration or just displaying them."**
--- My proposal does not include changing the "blur my location" as it already exists for user profiles. (I took a screenshot but the image won't upload, I'll try again in a minute.) So I wouldn't be changing how the location is displayed unless someone wants that added to my proposal.

**"How are you fixing "If a location is entered in this box it freezes with the spinner going and never shows a location:"? What measure are you taking for it?"**
--- I would need to identify what is causing the problem before solving it. My troubleshooting will begin with testing and experimenting to identify where the failure is, and then taking appropriate steps to correct it.
