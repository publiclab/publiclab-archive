[@bsugar](/profile/bsugar) added some really excellent research on finding associated tags that we can incorporate into the API planning. Just copying in here to keep as a reference as this moves forward. I'll also link into the long issue where this has been worked on: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1502

> ...I think the problem there would be that some tags belong to both categories.  There are two pieces to the tag graph, the calculation of tag co-occurrence (and subsequent removal of co-occurrences below a given threshold), and then the community detection.  You might be able to get away with just doing co-occurrences.  That code would be easy enough to transfer from python to ruby to run every so often.  Now that there is a web dev (hi by the way!) you could also just implement the javascript version of [tagoverflow](https://github.com/stared/tagoverflow#tagoverflow) and replace the data.

Later adding:

> Okay, so translating the co-occurrences to Ruby will require a bit more code then I thought it would be (see second paragraph).  Unfortunately, I can't find any co-occurrence libraries in Ruby (you might have better luck).  

> However, there are a bunch of recommendation engines available in Ruby which I guess makes more sense given Ruby&#39;s popularity as a back end for websites which inevitably include e-commerce.  [Reccomendify](https://github.com/asmuth/recommendify#synopsis) made sense to me right away. What you could do is instead of users purchasing products , you could treat each post as a user who &quot;purchases&quot; tags.  There&#39;s also [Recommendable](https://davidcel.is/recommendable/) but it was more opaque to me.

> If you want to use the method that was employed to make the graph above minus the making of the graph, you'd have to translate [this code](https://github.com/stared/tag-graph-map-of-stackexchange/blob/master/tag_bundle_processing.py) and run it in the Ruby version of [these commands](https://github.com/stared/tag-graph-map-of-stackexchange#beta-sites-and-other-tags).  You do not need the `export2graphml` function.  

> Essentially, you want a file that looks like [this](https://github.com/stared/tag-graph-map-of-stackexchange/blob/master/se_oe_tables/eo_stats_64.csv).  It won't be hard to calculate the counts of the tags individually, but trickier part is counting the co-occurrences.  But once you have those figures, calculating observed to expected ratio is easy and detailed [here](https://github.com/stared/tagoverflow#methods-and-tricks)
