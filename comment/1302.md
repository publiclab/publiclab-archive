I took a look to SpectralWorkbench.org and played around a bit with the capture app.
My Question is now: As I am using a normal digital cam and taking still pics, how do you compensate for different exposure times, because as you might see in the attached picture this has some kind of influence.

Edit: Including a picture from a https source is not working so I try a direkt link now.
