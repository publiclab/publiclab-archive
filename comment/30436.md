- Environmental Science can help gauge many things in the world that would be useful to have tabs on. 1. The population could potentially help us worry or have track of how much food and water and other resources are going to be needed. 2. The number of births could also tie into the population. 3. Just like the number of births recorded each year, the number of deaths could tie into the population via subtraction. 

 

- 4. The amount of people that are without access to clean drinking water is about 779,821,312. This would impact not only humans but also animals and their ecosystems, just like fish and wildlife. 5. The number of deaths recorded via starvation this year is 7,055,200 currently, this will also tie into the population via subtraction. 6. The amount of people with healthcare could potentially influence the population due to technology being able to save lives in the current era.
