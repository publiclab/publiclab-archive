Nice work. I'm looking into using VisualSFM to create orthorectified images. They recently added some new geo-referencing features but I haven't had a chance to check them out. Typically you either need the coordinates of the camera (hang a GPS next to the camera) or  coordinates for specific features on the ground that can be identified in the photos. If I manage to get VisualSFM to output ortho -images I'll post a research note.
As far as using aerial images as in interface for exploring data there are a some options. One is to use a GIS. QGIS has an eVis plugin that allows users to click on points/features and have a photo or other media like graphs, video, audio pop up. You can also create similar interactives. using Google Earth.
