I was kinda hoping that this would be as simple as inverting the color scale at the bottom but nothing that simple with stuff like this haha. From the result that you got with (R-(B-0.75))/(R+B), it seems that the trees have lost their distinction from the rest of the materials in the image which is interesting.  I have tried white balancing in photoshop but it really didn't get useable results, ending up purple or just white. I will continue to experiment with R and B levels to see if I can get anything that works. I hope that one day we can have a more in-depth and interactive infragram site too.

Additionally, from what I've seen, Gopro's that DO have white balance aren't able to balance to the extremes that the NDVI modifications create although they get closer. I may have to switch to a point-and-shoot camera at this rate, which is disappointing because the results I got with the GoPro seem good, the color scaling is just inverted ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶i̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶b̶o̶u̶g̶h̶t̶ ̶a̶ ̶l̶o̶t̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶m̶...

If you get any ideas about this I would love to hear them
