Quick question .... in your photo above (of the 0.4mm slit) it looks like there is a gap between the slit film and the paper holder for that film. (The slit films are actaully too narrow and are therefore difficult to completely cover the hole in the paper carrier. IF there were a gap there, you would essentially have two slits and, with a large area CFL source of light, that could really mess up the diffraction to the camera.
