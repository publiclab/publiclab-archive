Ah darnit, I deleted my comment above by accident, instead of editing it ...

Okay, the punchline is:

The only ways to compensate for the effect that variations in DIY probe designs have on the measured conductivity seem to be a) changing the geometry of the probe, or b) changing the capacitance.  We can dial in small changes to the capacitance with a 'trimmer' (linked above).  So, looks like maybe:  if your probe is way off, alter the geometry until you're in the ballpark; then make fine adjustments with the capacitor trimmer.  We'll need to figure out how 'off' various probes might be ...

One thing we could do is distribute a little 'smiley/froggy face' label that people can put on e.g. a bottle cap as a location to place screws, as an easy guide, in order to get everyone in the same ballpark ...
