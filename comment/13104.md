A good focal length for mapping is probably around 35 to 40mm (35 mm equiv.). That is what the old A495 had (37.6 mm). More typical small PowerShots have a focal length of 28.5 mm, and they have been used a lot for mapping, although that is getting a little wide so it is hard to stitch things at the edges. Some PowerShots go even wider to 23.8 mm (S95, S100, S110), and they should be zoomed in for mapping. I think the standard Mobius lens is about 23 mm equiv. (3.7 mm actual), but I'm not sure about that.

I think a 6 mm lens on a Mobius has an equivalent focal length of 38.4 mm (assuming the sensor is 1/2.7 in). So that is probably good for mapping. The 8 mm lens would have a 35 mm equiv. focal length of 51.2 mm. That would make very nice maps, but getting complete coverage would be hit or miss.

So a 5 mm or 6 mm lens should be good for mapping on the Mobius.

For other types of aerial photography, like stitching oblique panoramas or just capturing landscapes in single photos, a 4.5 mm lens could be good. That provides a 28.8 mm focal length (35 mm equivalent) like a typical small PowerShot.
