I've found that the clock timing with the Toshiba arrays is not quite as rigorous as suggested in the datasheet (I've only tried it with the TCD1103). They can be run at a much slower clock rate which means you do not have to have a fast ADC.
I have also been working with smaller arrays as I do not feel that getting anything more that 2 nm resolution is going to be desirable (or possible given limited and cheap optical components) and it means that the smaller amount of data can easily be stored in the RAM of a microprocessor.
And yes you're correct the datasheets confuse rather than clarify many points regarding the timing of various pulses to the pins on the ccd.
