Chris,you mentioned these in your email about my order. Brooxes Hangups™, are a more expensive but proven solution at $3.50 a pair, from http://www.brooxes.com/newsite/BBKK/BBKK-PARTS.html. The listing reads, "These simple, strong, lightweight aluminum hangers make attaching the Picavet rig to the kite line a simple matter. Hangups lace right into the Picavet lines, and are rustproof, foolproof, quick and easy to attach to the kite line, and quite secure in a wide wind range."
