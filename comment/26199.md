1. I've had success in getting sub-nanometer resolution by using lenses rather than mirrors. [A short writeup is here.](https://publiclab.org/notes/wln215/12-09-2019/open-source-spectrometer-for-detecting-laser-harmonics) I still have a ton of tweaking to do for concrete proof, but it is possible to lower the resolution by swapping the focal length of the secondary lens for something with a higher optical power.

2. Your main limitation is the physical size of the sensor. The pixels are 1.12 um in pitch which and you only have 3280 pixels to work with so if you wanted the whole spectrum you would need to move the sensor. 

3. Please, by all means if you want to replicate my design I'll post the files onto [github](https://github.com/wln215/opticcube), but I have a ton of polishing I need to do. If you need any help sourcing or building let me know!
