[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) Yes, Airpup's lift increases with the wind. I didn't measure the pull in 20mph winds, but I can say that it was at the limit of my ability to haul in line. I would estimate around 30lbs of pull.

Airpup is a kite and will fly in a sufficient wind when heavier than air. I tried one flight with an envelope full of mostly air and about 10 cubic feet of helium, and that worked alright. 

Airpup starts at 540g, growing to 1700g when inflated with air alone. In sufficient wind you could fly a brick too.
