Maybe I was wrong! The glare seems to be worse on the back background. Which looks best to y'all? 

only the outer two mm or so is transparent so maybe best if there is no writing under that part, but I think color matters more than writing. Light grey as a guide would probably work. 

For water quality monitoring rounding down to three decimals  in lat/long is the standard i think. but we could perhaps just wipe that field altogether? Or people could have the option of leaving the gps in as long as we explain it well enough.
