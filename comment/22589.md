[The Melexis MLX90614 Non-Contact Sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-melexis-mlx90614-non-contact-sensors/) has a temperature range of -70°C to +380°C. This is an infrared sensor so it does not have to touch the thing whose temperature you want to know. The field of view is about 90°, so it would have to be close to the stove to read only the stove temperature. This sensor is similar to the one in the [GY-90615 sensor I used here](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/05-26-2017/portable-thermal-ir-temperature-logger-unit). This is an I2C sensor which is available [at the KAPtery](http://kaptery.com/product/addon-sensors-etc) (but only if you buy a logger).

My wood stove has a fan which circulates room air through the stove ducts. I would like to hook up a [Nano Data Logger](http://kaptery.com/product/nano-logger-kit) with a GY-90615 so it turns this fan on and off depending on the stove temperature. The fan is a 120 volt fan, so I guess I need a 120 volt relay.
