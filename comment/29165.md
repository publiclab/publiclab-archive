I'm still in the information-gathering stage, so unfortunately haven't done any tests myself yet! Thanks for the heads up about the standard test. Coincidentally, about an hour ago I realized I misunderstood a part of your question, and recognized that wastewater could potentially _inhibit_ bioluminescence due to toxicity. (I was originally thinking of tagging compounds to see an increase in chemi/bioluminescence.) 

This review paper by Abbas et al. rounds up research showing how the bioluminescence inhibition assay has (or hasn't) demonstrated toxicity from heavy metals, pesticides, industrial effluents, and treated wastewater. 
[Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition assay for ecotoxicity assessment: A review](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Muhammad-Adil/publication/323725356_Vibrio_fischeri_bioluminescence_inhibition_assay_for_ecotoxicity_assessment_A_review/links/5ed6838d458515294529a535/Vibrio-fischeri-bioluminescence-inhibition-assay-for-ecotoxicity-assessment-A-review.pdf) 

As for using a DIY spectrometer to measure light output, what you've described makes sense to me (integrating peaks over time). Are you planning to try these modifications?

Thanks for these neat ideas!
