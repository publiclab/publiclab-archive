 A while back I experimented with some 35mm 'slide-mount' holographic grating film (I believe it was 1200) vs the DVD (which is 740). The diffraction angle difference can be significant (a more 'compressed' spectra for the film so lower resolution at the camera in terms of 'nm/pix'. Anyway, I found the film quite difficult to achieve sufficient mechanical stability. You could try compressing it between two glass microscope slides if you could find a way to maintain the compression force as a constant. Direct contact would help reduce the glass-air-film-air-glass transitions.

As I recall, I looked at the transmission characteristics of both the film and the polycarbonate of the DVD and concluded that, relative to the limits UV sensitivity of the WEB cam (drops to near zero at about 420nm) the thickness and material didn't matter.

My guess is that making the spectrometer housing light-tight is way more important than any incidental refractive-based issues at the grating due to film vs DVD.

So, 1) rigid optical path (slit-grating-camera), 2) light-tight and 3) totally opaque slit material with very sharp very parallel edges.
