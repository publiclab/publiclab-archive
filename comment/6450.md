Update -- I've changed the infrapix code so that it always displays a color table that spans the full range of possible NDVI values (-1 to 1).  Note: in order to generate a new analysis of an already-opened image, it seems like it works best to rename the file you're submitting.  E.g., I took your example above, renamed it as "sat1.png", and processed it, with [this result](http://infrapix.pvos.org/show/sat1.png).  With these settings, the relationship between a given NDVI value and a particular color should always be consistent.  Let me know if it works for you? (And if this is really what we want ... maybe a different color table would be appropriate ... though I guess we want to hone in on one particular one soon, to facilitate comparison across images ...)
