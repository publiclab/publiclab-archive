Wow that is super interesting. That would definitely cover the variation over space... but what about if the levels vary over time in each particular place? Even a couple 6 minute sample times would not be able to cover variation over the course of the day. 

Unless that is part of the author's point, that variation over time is minimal compared to variation over space?
