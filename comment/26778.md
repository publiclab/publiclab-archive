Katie- Just received your email. will respond there about Tonawanda Coke. re: the GC/MS its a standard EPA method. There is a special apparatus that's connected to the instrument to connect the bag. From what I understand, there are only a few labs with this set up. The lab we have always used is ALS in N CA.
