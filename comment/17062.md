Hi Sebastian, i know OpenTreeMap is quite a big platform at this point, but considering how many activists have put work into it over the years i think perhaps it's worth another consideration by your team instead of starting over yet another tree mapping and adoption platform. True, it is designed for urban environments where people can walk around with smart phones and drop points on a map, but you can also bulk upload points that you collect via a GPS in the field, and then you'd have all the adoption and management features ready to go.
