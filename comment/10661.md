Wow, some real bold testing going on here. I'm just careful to keep my boots dry, and there's no big problem, but that kind of limits the utility of my boots. I'd be interested to see the EM culture if it's not hard to bring it. I'll trade you for sourdough? I wonder if sourdough starter could outcompete shoe cultures.
