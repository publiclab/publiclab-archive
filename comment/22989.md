We could try to use a wiki page with an Activities grid -- http://publiclab.org/activities which prompts people to post, and provides a template as you've laid out. If you want to make a page at, say, http://publiclab.org/wiki/papers, maybe, I'd be happy to help you with the wiki templates! 

https://publiclab.org/wiki-templates has some extra info on this too. Great idea!!!
