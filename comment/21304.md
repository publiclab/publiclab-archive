Hi, all, i finally got it working... you know, I think i'd had a couple things wrong, but also the long wires (although easier to insert) make it really hard to see where the wires are going, and come out more easily. 

What do you think about this type of wire, which while it's harder to assemble, is much easier to debug and more similar to the Fritzing diagrams?
