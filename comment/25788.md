Hello [@natalie_stjean](/profile/natalie_stjean),
I am happy to see your full-fledged proposal on the first go.
I really like the simplistic tone which explains the proposals to a newbie very easily.
I loved your mock ups.
There are a few suggestions and questions which I will like to ask you.
 Please include dates in the timeline so that it will be easier for mentors to review it.
 `Blur your location` -> You proposed that it will show some part of the location. Let us say my address is lat:x, lon:y OR ABC Colony, Delhi, India, Asia. As proposed, lat and lon willn't be shown if the location is blurred. I want to know how much precision will be there in the actual address given by the user. Are we taking those addresses into consideration or just displaying them.
How are you fixing "If a location is entered in this box it freezes with the spinner going and never shows a location:"? What measure are you taking for it?
