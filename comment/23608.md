Hi [@anan12](/profile/anan12) -- thank you!

> Top navbar on map

This is a cool idea! Please note though, that the demo of LEL at https://publiclab.github.io/leaflet-environmental-layers/example/ is intended to show off what the library can do, while it's real usage is embedded in many different pages across PublicLab.org, MapKnitter.org, and hopefully many more as it gets better known!

> Add a meaningful name to the base layers and this will be displayed on top like basic, streets etc

This is a great idea. I also liked your idea that people could add GeoJSON files!

Very interesting! That's wonderful! No wonder you know so much about GeoJSON ðŸ˜ƒ 

Did you know, over 10 years ago I worked on some of the earliest implementations of vector tiles -- whoa that seems like forever ago! https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-072X-9-14
