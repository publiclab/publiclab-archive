Aloha,
I recently started using an UAV to capture high resolution imagery that I then process with Pix4D software.  One of the outputs of the software (provided you have good image overlap) is a .LAS (or .LAZ) file that has an resolution about 4x the 2D pixel resolution.  So if my image resolution is ~3.5 cm, then my .LAS file pixels have a ~6 Inch pixel size.  No need for a LIDAR sensor, all done via Photogrammetry.
