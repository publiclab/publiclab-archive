does it make sense to put the mounting holes on the main body of the board, eliminate the "breakaway tabs" and just make the whole unit a little longer. It would be longer, but we have length to work with. Would decrease complexity of manufacture with a rectangular piece and no perforations, I bet. And allows people to use it in different configurations without making any "destructive" changes to their Riffle. 

I do think it's conceivable that folks would want to use it in a housing, then another time in a project box with mounts.

could just be two or three holes, snuck in among the electronics, such as on this webcam example:
