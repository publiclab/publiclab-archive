Hi

The first pictures I have are with only one camera and an unmodified one.

Now I bought the second camera, same model as the first and was considering modifying it.
So my question remains. On this NDVI did you modify one camera?
Did you use the filters inside the camera or in front of the lens.
And how did you choose the channel  to compute NDVI...

Thanks
Rita
