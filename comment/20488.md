Hi [@sciencetoolbar](/profile/sciencetoolbar) , I noticed that the webpage you've linked to in a few of your posts is no longer active. I think folks would be interested in learning a little more about your process, so I'd like to encourage you (if you're interested!) to add any of your supporting materials or additional content to your posts here-- the majority of the people using this site are working with environmental monitoring kits, but I think that power generation (especially alternative or DIY forms of power generation) is a really meaningful topic for people to consider, especially if they're thinking about ways to keep their tools running when they're out in the field, or attempting to collect data in a situation where usual sources of electricity are inaccessible. I'd be very interested to hear if you've been thinking about any specific ways that these generators might be used by others. Thanks for sharing!
