Ok, hacky but cool:

* Cut open an A23 batter (the same type we're already using for 12v power to the 555 circuit): [http://www.instructables.com/id/12-Volt-Battery-Hack!-You_ll-be-Surprised.../](http://www.instructables.com/id/12-Volt-Battery-Hack!-You_ll-be-Surprised.../) (hilariously well narrated in movie-star voice)
* Cut down an n-type battery holder to hold just 3 cells: http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Coin-Cell-Holder/step2/We-Can-Work-It-Out/

This means we can just ship/order 2-packs of both the battery holder and the batteries themselves, and not muck around with different battery types. There may be a more elegant solution out there using a voltage regulator, but this means fewer parts to order, and seems pretty easy to do.

I tried actually inserting a wire halfway into the A23 battery to use both 12v and 5.5v power at the same time... but that was probably not a good idea and i drained the battery pretty fast. Someone with a formal  background in electronics probably would've known better ;-)
