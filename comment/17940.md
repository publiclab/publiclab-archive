Fiji made that histogram of the color NDVI image. The NDVI image is not an RGB color image (it is a single channel image with a color look up table applied), so you can't use "Color Histogram" under "Analyze." Use "Histogram" and it will make a histogram of the values between 0 and 255. Use the cursor to marquee an area in the image and click "Live" in the Histogram window.
