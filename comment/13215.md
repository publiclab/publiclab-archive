We can't see methane because visible light passes right through it. DIY infrared cameras based on consumer cameras can't detect methane because near infrared light also passes right through it. Methane absorbs longer wavelengths of infrared light, so cameras sensitive to those wavelengths can see methane. I don't know of any DIY techniques to detect those wavelengths. Modified consumer cameras can be sensitive to wavelengths between 380 nm and 1000 nm (0.38 to 1.00 µ). Methane absorbs in two bands near 3311 nm and 7692 nm (3.31 µ to 7.69 µ).

*Absorption spectrum of methane. Vertical scale is percent absorption. DIY infrared cameras are sensitive to light between 0.38 µ and 1.0 µ.*
