This is just a note that my 3d print company flagged the design for the pi-camera holder , I don't think its a problem but I am not sure how to correct the stl file.....

Thank you for ordering with i.materialise.
Unfortunately your order is currently on hold, because it looks like your design(s) needs to be adjusted before we can print it. In order to continue with the printing process, we would like you to take a look at the following issue(s):

New model.3mf (Polyamide (SLS)/Natural white):
• extra surfaces with no thickness have to be eliminated.

• The walls of your model are not thick enough. This might cause fragile parts to break during printing. You can find the recommended minimum wall thickness for Polyamide (SLS) in our design guide or you can read our tutorial about choosing the right wall thickness.
