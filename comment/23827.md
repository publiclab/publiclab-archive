When i read the original poster's question, my takeaway is that this is a student working in a group that has already hooked up a plantower sensor and has begun getting readings, and wants to know more about what they mean. 
  
When i read [@jeffalk](/profile/jeffalk)'s comment above, my takeaway is to appreciate this is a very helpful and experienced person interested in providing guidance to air quality inquiries. Another way that the original poster might think about the questions being asked about their project framing could be to visit the https://publiclab.org/issue-brief page, which encourages people to share the "who, what, where, and why" of their issue, as well as perhaps https://publiclab.org/study-design. 
  
As a moderator of this community, I cringed when i read the aggressive question inside of the generally helpful comment that challenged "Are you technically savvy enough to turn the box into a usable tool?" and i encourage us all to keep in mind that Public Lab is a space for people to share skills and knowledge to support one another's work, and to encourage investigation, experimentation, and skill building. 
  
Generally, framing questions and criticisms in a way that helps us all understand each other and our subject matter better is a good start -- for example: offering prompts, suggestions and asking questions when unsure about how someone is approaching a project. This isn't always intuitive or easy, but is a generous way we can engage constructively with one another. Thank you for reading.
