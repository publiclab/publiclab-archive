Hi, this is awesome! :) I'm an atomic physicist and co-founder of the [Taipei Hackerspace](https://taipeihack.org). We have a bunch of 3D printers here that people learned to use really well recently, and I'd like to build a little physics lab into the space - this would be a great addition, or even kickstarting piece, for that. :) I'm also working on [open-hardware for research](https://moonpunch.org), and you guys really show that I have to step up my game. Congrats, and I'll be sure to follow this project. :)
