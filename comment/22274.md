    Are these images that seem to be from a camera correctly converted?  
This camera has not been modified. The IR cut filter is still installed.

    Would you recommend using the red or blue filter if I do need to mod the mobs?  
A red filter usually works best.

    Must I remove an IR filter in the action cam?  
If you want to capture near infrared light, the IR cut filter must be removed. The filter is glued to the back of the lens, but some people have had success heating up the glue and removing it.

The Public Lab Store might replace your camera if you make a request.
