Hi [@warren](/profile/warren), 
I like [#image-sequencer](/tag/image-sequencer). It would be very interesting to develop a variation of it customised for aerial imaging. It would have to include things like radiometric calibration, vignette correction, gradient (which it's already included), and maybe an image registration or mosaic builder. 
People could then buy the hardware, capture images and process them using [#image-sequencer](/tag/image-sequencer). 
Let me know what you think.
Regards, 
Mayke
