Smoke particles (and by smoke I mean combustion products) come in sizes all the way down to 1nm (0.001micron) and in shapes that make it very tricky to define their size!
If you search for "[microscope image smoke](https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=microscope+image+smoke)" you'll find lots of images showing what they look like.
[Here is a very short but informative text about aerosols](http://alg.umbc.edu/usaq/archives/001044.html)
In general, if you capture particles on a filter you'll see particles even as large as 100 micron and small as 0.001 micron so you'll see something in a microscope.
