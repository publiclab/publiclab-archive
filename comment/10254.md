News from the North Brooklyn Boat Club: 

Yesterday NYCDEP reported a break in the case. In their words:  

"We received an anonymous spill report of dumping... we contacted the US Coast Guard. We also brought in more DEC Spills staff. Our BECI unit is preparing their case, and we will discuss this with Regional Legal Counsel as to how the case will proceed. This investigation took quite some time, but it paid off, and we have abated a chronic problem that some people dismissed as "just routine sheens on Newtown Creek".  The public in the area has been actively involved in this matter, and credit should go in part to them."

Keep up the great work!
