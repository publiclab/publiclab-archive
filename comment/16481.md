Regarding reply by email, that sounds great! I think we might start by making a test service where you can reply but we don't actually tell anyone about it, so we can work out the issues first. Also - how can we test that out? Can you find some examples of testing Griddle controllers as we test the email _sending_ controllers? Thanks!

I found there's a code display bug and wrote it up here: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1358
