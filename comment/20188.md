Update:

I build a quick and dirty horizontal slit (approx 1mm wide) and indeed the image is more broad now. However, it is very dark. Below is a picture that uses a 6W LED lamp at 10cm distance. I cranked the exposure all the way up using Guvcview and set the focus to 200mm.

Suggestions highly appreciated :)
