I guess. What a pain in the butt. I tried for about an hour to post them at the original size and the wiki just said updating, perpetually and never added the photos. Finally I had to "save picture" from the infragram.org recent pictures page as is and they finally loaded. I'll have to try the app a little later. There are a lot of pictures.
