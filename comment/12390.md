Thanks Richard,

Recently disturbed sites like a forest logged 50 years ago or a pasture abandoned 50 years ago will tend to have higher biological diversity than mature forest or shrubland (pioneer species are short lived and multiple early successional pathways tend to converge on fewer community types). Have you noticed that mature habitats have lower spectral diversity than disturbed habitats?
