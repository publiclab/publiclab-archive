I've been looking into these two lights ([here](https://www.amazon.com/I-MU-Flexible-Gooseneck-Brightness-Gray-White/dp/B071Y3P8ZC/) and [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F8Q0C8K/ref=sspa_dk_detail_1?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B01F8Q0C8K&pd_rd_wg=2SQuo&pd_rd_r=CZEG1K99PVZF8EEQTG87&pd_rd_w=WJVuy)), and also heard that a cell phone could work with a holder [like this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HDZJ1ZE/ref=sspa_dk_detail_2?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B01HDZJ1ZE&pd_rd_wg=6yw83&pd_rd_r=19T8CJ0623H0PWP5DVYS&pd_rd_w=Pu5FI).
