Hi, Dave and [@ygstcu](/profile/ygstcu) - I have a version of the gain correction code loaded into a local copy of my code, and am testing it out. Dave, can you link me to an un-corrected spectrum on Spectral Workbench which I can run the code on, and then we can compare the output of my correction code to the corrected data you generated? If they match, then we're very close.
