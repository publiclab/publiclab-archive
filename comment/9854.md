Philgib-  I tried using the GIMP+BIMP combination that you suggested and it seems relatively straightforward.  The only problem is I have no way of knowing how to set the lens distortion correction values.  When working with a single photograph it gives you a live preview, but the batch processing menu has nothing of the sort and the parameters are different so I can't just copy them over from a single image.  Can you maybe go into a little more detail about how you used Gimp for batch processing Lens distortions?
