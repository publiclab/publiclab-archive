I think any camera could allow you to estimate how thick ice is, if you can put the ice between the camera and the light source. The thicker the ice, the more light will be absorbed and the dimmer the light source will appear on the other side. Near infrared light behaves similarly to red light when passing through ice -- both are mostly absorbed by the ice, but NIR is absorbed more strongly.

The blue end of the spectrum is not absorbed as strongly, which is why ice can appear blue (only the blue wavelengths pass through). Ice and [liquid water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Water_absorption_coefficient_large.gif) both absorb visible and near infrared light about the same amount, although imperfections in the ice can make it more opaque. The variability of those imperfections will make it difficult to use light transmission to estimate the thickness of ice because the light transmission will depend mostly on the imperfections and not the thickness. Estimating ice thickness by using a photo of the surface of the ice on a frozen body of water might be difficult, but on any water body there might be subtle cues related to thickness, especially soon after the first freezing event.
