I don't think there's any particular reason you can't do that, but it will require you do some work:
* Extracting the data would probably require that you crop out several ROIs.
* The slist would probably need to be correctly spaced, too close and you would get the spectra to overlap, too far and they would be out of the FOV.

BTW: do note that as the slit used in the public lab spectrometer has a wide slit and not a point source you would get a 1D image, I'm guessing the spectral workbench is then integrating along the wavelength axis to improve the SNR, but you could re-write this code.

Do share your experience.
