No, I will not have a job if I get to work with Public labs in GSOC.

Public Lab's Website is plots2 repository of Public labs

I will be going towards Rails 5.1 upgrade if and only if I am completed with Rails 5.0

Ruby 2.2.2 is the minimum requirement. That's why I wrote its qualities. Otherwise we could use newer version than Ruby 2.2.2

At any point of time, I can't tell I have had enough tests. But I will try to read the whole codebase and make tests for plots2. Also I am planning to use incremental testing. So I would write test for both previous version and next version.

Thanks for your questions [@jasnow](/profile/jasnow). I will update these details in my proposals soon.
