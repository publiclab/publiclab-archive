Hi [@stevie](/profile/stevie), I'm not sure if this is on the market yet, but it looks like IBM is developing a chip that they're aiming to price at $200: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-tiny-detection-chip-could-find-methane-leaks-autonomously/, and I've heard of a few other challenges (e.g. the EDF methane sensor development challenge), but I'm not sure if any of them are out yet either. FLIR cameras for methane detection usually run upwards of $30,000, which I think is why there is currently a lot of research going into lower-cost sensors. Here's another soon-to-be product: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400516303161.
