Snap. We should have a brainstorming session on cheap forms of reflective stuff!

My list so far has been:
-Alufoil. (Too easy to crease - which lowers light intensity)
-Takeaway containers. (Sometimes can be embossed, which means the same issue as above occurs)
-Old tins. (Sometimes have internal lining - plus difficult to bend and shape)
-Empty coffee bean packets. (Perfect, depends on the packet though. Some are lined with plastic, others use shiny stuff like you show above)

Great! Now I have an excuse to get my partner to buy me a packet of crisps!!! ;)
