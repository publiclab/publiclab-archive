Hi [@stevie](/profile/stevie), [@Aleah](/profile/Aleah), [@Cbarnes9](/profile/Cbarnes9), and [@crispinpierce](/profile/crispinpierce),
I may be jumping the gun here but since .csv files are openable by EXCEL  and can be copied and pasted into a single workbook, I assume the problem is in what is meant by "amalgamate" so besides some example files please supply some more explanation about "amalgamating".
Thanks,
