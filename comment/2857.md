Instructions for using the Public Lab spectrometers are here: http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/spectral-workbench-usage

The key instruction for you there might be "Once you have an assembled spectrometer connected to your computer or smartphone, go to https://spectralworkbench.org and click Capture."

If you have any trouble getting things to work, there are lots of people joining the conversation at the Google group dedicated to the spectrometers: 
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/plots-spectrometry">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/plots-spectrometry</a>

Be sure to include details about the type of spectrometer, the success you have had so far, and maybe a photo or two.

Good Luck,
Chris
