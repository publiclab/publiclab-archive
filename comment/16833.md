hello savargaz, thanks for the answer. 
what are your thoughts on distinguishing classes as large as all plastics.
Will there be a unique spectral signature pattern specific for all plastic objects that will allow me to mass sort all kind of plastics? or do I have to scan and record the spectral signature for each object that I want to sort prior to sorting?
also what are your thoughts on shinny objects? like some shiny metal surfaces? will that 
affect the spectrometer reading (lights reflecting off the surface)?
thanks
