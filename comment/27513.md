My experience with broad illumination for spectral imaging is to prefer an incandescent type lamp, sometimes with a blue LED in addition to that. Halogen lamps (the kind used in the automotive market or decaroica lamps is a simple way to make those.
If you plot the LED spectrum you have here next to the reflectance spectrum of chlorophyll you could see why it is so important.
