Environment is the abiotic and biotics things that surrounds us. Science is the study of life/ earth involving observations, investigations and discovery. Abiotic non-living organisms. Biotic is the living organisms. Population is how much people or animals living in an area or country. Population is a big concern when it comes down to environment because the higher the population the less the resources we have to provide.
