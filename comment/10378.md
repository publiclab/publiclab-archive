Good work here. I like the blowout warning idea. Experimenting with the oil density is def. another good step, but I agree that the distinct variation in spectra is important to define first on SWB. The density issue might be solvable with really good sampling methods if we are finding that is a problem. Something perhaps like you run 3 samples of the same substance at different concentrations and average the line? 

Can you explain the vertical lines a little more?
