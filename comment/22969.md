Hi [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n), with regards to the medical situation vs equipment, it sounds like the particle sizes they are measuring are relevant for (1) respiratory particles (< 5 um) that can travel deep into the lungs and get caught there, and (2) particles that are so small they can enter the bloodstream. The estimated maximum size for being able to enter the bloodstream is 100 nanometers (0.1 um), but as noted in my comment above, those particles are very difficult to measure. I'd love to know exactly what equipment these facilities are using for both size fractions! 

With regard to what we are measuring, I think we can discern down to ~ 1 um diameter, thought probably with at least +/- 1 um precision. So, I'd really say we're *hoping* to look at the PM10-PM2.5 fraction. Some of those would be respirable (< 5 um), some would be inhaled but not respired (5 < x < 10 um). Does that get at the question you're asking? I'm not quite sure I understood correctly. Thanks!
