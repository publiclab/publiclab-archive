I hope to have some wind this weekend and be able to test the rig.
That particular design of kite is one of my favorites. It has a great lift power, it flights very well with strong and medium winds, It is no difficult to make, you can place the camera in the structure of the kite and it is protected by the kite, and the line goes strait into the frame, so there is no angle to correct depending on the strength of the wind making it easier to set it up.
