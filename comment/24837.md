My first thought on this is that the volume of a sphere grows much faster (it's 3 dimensions, so cubed!) than just adding more balloons (which is just linear growth) so, more intuitively (to me), you can look at this diagram from https://science.howstuffworks.com/helium2.htm (fair use low res image):
