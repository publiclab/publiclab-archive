Thoughts: 1 - Splash-resistant, maybe, (there are holes), 2 - Masonite does not cut nicely, 3 - Acrylic (even laser-cut) tends to have very sharp edges (it's a lot like glass in that respect), 4 - Polycarbonate is not quite as stiff but laser-cuts well and a little less sharp, 5 - most laser-cut plastics will require at least de-burr to minimize risk to users, 6 - Can corrugated cardboard be laser cut w/o burning?, 7 - If cardboard, perhaps a self-adhesive overlay (then trimmed)? if the added labor is ok.

However, designing the materials and details without first establishing the stress requirements is approaching the problems in reverse. Eg: If the product needs to withstand 25 lbs, then cardboard is not a consideration unless it has many layers. Defining the stresses means 1 - static weight and the direction(s) of force, 2) flexure, 3) vibration (and that coupling from outside to inside optics), 4) non-orthogonal force (eg. corner to corner), 5) assembly force (screw-tightening - i.e. acrylic likes to fracture, polycarbonate less so), etc....... Deciding these limits means defining the expected (and product-specified) environmental conditions. None of this has to be elaborate; but you do need to think about and make decisions based on specs you need or want to achieve. Eg: 1) can't easily over-tighten screws and crack the housing, 2) can drop it on the floor from 3 feet and it will survive, still work and not be out of alignment, 3) can put 3 lbs of books in a backpack on top of it, 4) can pull on the unit untill the USB cable comes unplugged and the cable, camera and alignment will not suffer, etc......
