 Yes-- this is the same process. The issue with washing machines, as Eucastic above points out, is that there is a force to the water that a simple and dense filter like Babylegs doesn't necessarily account for. It would take a dedicated built-out, but nylon is what post plastic filters would be made of regardless of the build, and the least expensive and most accessible small mesh filter we've tested is baby tights. You could also use the cotton ones here-- we don't use them in the trawl because they get really heavy in the water, but that wouldn't matter here. At the same time, there's a reason you don't find many cotton water filters... they decay faster than others. 
If you test this out, let us know how it goes!
