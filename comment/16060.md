Cool, thanks. I took a pic of a grid with my Mobius (an old one, i'm not actually sure of the lens) and got this:

I couldn't get a perfect undistort, but this is about as close as I got, using the settings:

`a: 0.884, b: 0.912, F: 1.96, scale: 0.842, x: 1, y: 1`

I think it's possible the distortion is not working as it should on a non-square image? See how the horizontal lines are bent one way but the verticals the other.
