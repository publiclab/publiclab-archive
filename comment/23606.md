Hi [@gautami_gg](/profile/gautami_gg) -- thank you so much for your proposal! 

I like the thorough analysis you've given. Although we have provided some designs to be implemented, you have dug in deeper and found things we forgot, like:

> Issue: No search availability.[Reference to: Wireframe 4(a) - 2]

I do encourage you to adopt more of the "look and feel" of the mockups we've provided, but I very much like your critical thinking about the details and usage, and like your wireframes! 

If you'd like, you can use the components on this shared mockups file, copying the slides and rearranging things to see what your wireframes might look like in the visual style we're going for: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TCZoTfuhamRVrUak8aDgqJAwSgyhRtZg2Pgacl2_4zc/edit#slide=id.g4e2261b4b2_0_0

I especially liked hearing about the legal queries site you mentioned. In some ways we are doing something similar for environmental problems, though not just consulting formal experts -- also building on knowledge from grassroots projects!

Thanks a lot!
