Hello all, 
Following a discussion I had with [@liz](/profile/liz), I'm adding a new design for the /people page (let me know what you think [@warren](/profile/warren) et al! )

A brief explanation :) 
It's a three column page featuring:
1. on the left is a leader board to give you a quick impression of who's most active (and what the benchline is)
2. in the middle is the "recommendation engine" with people suggested to you by most active, either by area or people following the same category. I removed the "follow" component (and number of followers), after discussing this with Liz.
3. on the right is a number of users cufrently onilne (and a prompt to join the chat), followed by a map that displays recently active people in my area. Lastly, a list of most active projects (in my area).

If the user has not shared the location yet, they would be prompted to do so, by clicking "Share my location" - see the design below.

As always, the main goal is to connect users with other active members in their community (either by location or topic of interest). 

When a user has shared their location and follows at least one topic/tag: 
[![people_v2.png](/i/28991)](/i/28991)

When a user hasn't followed a topic/tag yet:
[![people_v3.png](/i/28993)](/i/28993)

When a user hasn't shared their location yet:
[![people_v4.png](/i/28996)](/i/28996)

Let me know what you think :)

Eva
