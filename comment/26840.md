Hi [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) ! Thanks for your message. [@sophied](/profile/sophied) and I are huge fans of rtl-sdr.com and the various tutorials posted there. The rtl-sdr forums were crucial in my and [@sophied](/profile/sophied) 's process of learning how to decode NOAA transmissions. [@sophied](/profile/sophied) uses a rtl-sdr V3 and I use a funcube dongle pro +. We've also been experimenting with the various kinds of software available. I prefer SDR# (on Windows) or SDRDx (on Mac OS) while [@sophied](/profile/sophied) primarily uses CubicSDR (on Mac OS). We have our sights set on decoding transmissions from Meteor M N2 next. Unfortunately we live too far outside of the coverage footprint of GOES-16 and GOES-17 to be able to receive those transmissions. 

It's great to know that you have experience in NOAA and geostationary sats. [@sophied](/profile/sophied) and I are working toward publishing a Wiki on radio-based weather / earth-sensing to share with the PL community and perhaps discover intersections with other existing projects and datasets on this platform. Hopefully we can stay in touch!
