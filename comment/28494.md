Hi [@warren](/profile/warren)! Thanks a lot for your review! I think It's a great idea to show coauthored posts mixed in with authored posts, maybe we can also add a filter button to show them separately too. Talking about the technical possibilities, maybe we can try something like:
`.where('term_data.name = ? OR term_data.parent = ? OR node.uid = ?', coauthored_tag.to_s, coauthored_tag.to_s, uid).order('created DESC')` to get both the authored and coauthored posts together?
