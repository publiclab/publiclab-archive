**Idea 2:** the [#simple-air-sensor](/tag/simple-air-sensor) could be used alongside a more expensive device like a [#purple-air](/tag/purple-air), to give a more ambient awareness of the readings (so you notice over the course of the day, rather than having to monitor the app). This seems a bit silly since it's based on the same sensor, but it's cheap enough that people might do this while not using their Simple Air Sensor for something else. Also, you could note when you see it turn red, and later check the data to see if it was recorded by the other sensor.
