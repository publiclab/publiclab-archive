This is a good idea.  There are a series of PM, NOx and SOx monitoring tools built around this idea that require a balance such as this.

 I found his work while looking for passive monitors.  I dismissed it as too difficult for a community science project based on the cost of a balance. there are two such projects listed here:

Martin Ferm is one developer in Sweden, here's one of the projects he's worked on for NOx.  He deploys strings of NOx/SOx sensitive materials and raw filters in housings, and weighs them:
