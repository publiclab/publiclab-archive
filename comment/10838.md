Ned - The white balance preset used for those photos was "Sunny." Jeff Taylor at Event38 recommends either Cloudy or AWB, so it is apparently not too critical. All of the standard white balance presets are pretty similar to each other compared to the artificial custom white balance we have been doing. Here is an old comparison of moss on a gray stone patio with a Rosco 2007 filter. The custom white balance is on a gray stone, not blue paper which would make the moss more orange.  None of the photos below make meaningful NDVI images.

It might be that the good NDVI results from the Event38 photos are not related so much to the difference between the red and blue channel DNs (although that has to be high to get high NDVI values), but to the magnitude of the DNs. The divisor in the NDVI equation is red + blue, so when that is high, NDVI is lower. So maybe the Event38 filter produces consistently lower DNs for both red and blue than other blue filters. 

Below is one of the photos straight from the camera and the two steps I usually take to make a pseudo false color IR image. The result is pseudo because legacy CIR is NRG and this one (bottom) is NBG.  The hue adjustment is different for each set of photos.
