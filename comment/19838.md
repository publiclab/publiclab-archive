I also found this which, I'm reading at the moment:

Most webcams have auto exposure and color "correction" so that in dim light, you can still see. This will unfortunately change the exposure between readings, so for quantitative work, it must be disabled. On Linux, you can use the "uvcdynctl" utility as outlined here.

On a Mac, you can download this utility: http://www.phoboslab.org/log/2009/07/uvc-camera-control-for-mac-os-x
