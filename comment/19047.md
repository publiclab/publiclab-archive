Yes it will be easy to link to the social media icons listed on the profile page. 
I previously thought that we could have an integration at the last stage but the integration needs to be done simultaneously. Sorry about that. 
Also, sign up and login will be done in a single step. If done in multiple steps, it may have some problem in the production.
