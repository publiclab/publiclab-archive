Hi Dave - I love this post. There are lots of simple, rigorous tests that can be done to test an assumption -- such as the assumption that all 400nm LEDs are actually 400nm -- which are so important to the work we're doing, and this is a perfect example. I gave you a Barnstar for the note to mark this.

Were these LEDs of the same brand? The same part number? Or were they a variety? Which LEDs did you actually test -- can you post part [#s](/tag/s)? Thanks!

Other simple questions we should answer:

Are the spectra of different halogen (specifically Solux) bulbs the same? How close? 

How about those of different RGB LEDs?

Also, do you have these as a set in Spectral Workbench, or could you share the ID [#s](/tag/s)?
