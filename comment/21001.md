Just compiling some quick links to where these parts can be found cheaply and easily:

* Sensor: $16.50 on amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Air-Quality-Sensors-Grove-Sensor/dp/B00P03TFT4/
* 5x Arduino nanos: $20 presoldered with USB cable: https://www.amazon.com/Emakefun-Arduino-ATmega328P-Micro-controller-Pre-soldered/dp/B0775XQXRB/
* $8 for lots of cables to connect these with no soldering: https://www.amazon.com/COMeap-120pcs-Female-Breadboard-Jumper/dp/B01MU0IMFF/
* RGB LEDs: 100x for $9 https://www.amazon.com/Tricolor-Multicolor-Lighting-Electronics-Components/dp/B01C19ENFK/

For these, it'd be about $21 per kit. 

Also, add $14 for a nicer sensor:

* $30 shipped, laser particle sensor with fan - https://www.amazon.com/Beaster-particle-Digital-Purifier-Precision/dp/B07F2X6RVF
