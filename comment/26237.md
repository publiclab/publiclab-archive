The sunlight is not an issue. For a winter-long monitoring goal, a few measurements every day are plenty, and those can be taken at night. With the unit powered off all day long, the batteries will last a long time.

Stacking a few sensors on a pole, one every 1.3 meters, should be a reasonable solution. The program running the thing can even read the data and output a single snow depth result.
