 Thanks a lot [@warren](/profile/warren)! I actually thought a lot about this, but then I realized that CSV files are quite big and heavy and parsing them on the front-end, at the client side would put an unnecessary load on the clients browser. So a heavy task like this could be handled very easily by the server. Besides, we would be needing to write the file-user logic there only, so this could be handled together with it. I am open to doing what you suggested as well. What do you think?
