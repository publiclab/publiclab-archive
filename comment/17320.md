Dear [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie),
Thank you for your kind response.
Actually, I'm not getting the meaning of Color key. I'm an apology for that.
It's kind of NDVI BAR or NDVI Index value bar? 
For ex.:
[![ndvi_bar.jpg](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/565/large/ndvi_bar.jpg)](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/565/original/ndvi_bar.jpg)

Right Now, I'm Working with the single camera to find out the NDVI I'm Using BGN-475-550-850 (Blue+Green+NIR) lens to post process Image.
Blue using as a Visible image and Red using as NIR image for NDVI Processing.
I'm also using Infragram.org website online tool for NDVI post processing.

Infragram tool output:

My NDVI Output: 
[![BGN__NDVI.jpg](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/568/large/BGN__NDVI.jpg)](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/568/original/BGN__NDVI.jpg)

Between Both output images, there is a major difference is Color. 
Can I use color mapping for my output image to convert the same color as infrgram output image?

I had read about the camera calibration technique. Is it necessary for the single camera solution? If yes what kind of setting is needed for that? like, Auto white balance, Hue, saturation.

Thanks and regards
