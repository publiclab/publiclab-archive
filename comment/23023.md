This is relatively close to your question, or at least related! 

https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/02-01-2018/is-there-a-way-to-view-epa-s-toxics-release-inventory-on-a-map-or-by-location

And [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) is working on how to display these maps as layers in a combined map here: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/2486

Just linking these together!
