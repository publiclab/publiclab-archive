Unfortunately ..... while photomultipliers respond to many wavelengths, they do not differentiate between wavelengths (they just multiply the electron count in response to a photon striking a photocathode [so loss of wavelength information] -- but do provide high sensitivity) .... and a polarizing filter is non-directional other than polarization -- collimation requires optics such as a lens which focuses light from a point source ... alas, spectrometers are complicated devices .....

I do not follow the 'integration time' concept nor the 'm/s' units. Integration time for laser light would be "near instantaneous", 245 m/s can't be measurements/sec or meters/sec and 245 mS would be much too long. I'm also not following the plots and the units of annotation. The webcam's AGC might have a measurable time response (eg. 30 fps video) but then that would be a measurement of the camera's ACG response, not the laser ... so I'm baffled .....
