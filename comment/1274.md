In the call the other day on the experimental design we discussed the need to tape over the canisters at the end of the experiment to prevent air contamination. In sending out the experiment we are working under the assumption that the bag does that, so at least for this first experiment that might be an unnecessary step. I just mention because it is just another thing that will take time in the field.
