Thanks for the feedback.

I think I misunderstood the function of this plugin. I thought I could calibrate my jpeg R/G/NIR images to a black, a grey, and a white panel of known reflectance, while attempting to return some of the linear-response of a RAW. NDVI would be done separately. My proposed workflow is:

* Pre-process vignetting, dark current, etc. in Lightroom or DCRaw using custom lens profiles
* Run those outputs through the plugin to calibrate to different shaded targets
* Orthomosaic and generate reflectance map in Pix4D
* Calculate NDVI and other VIs in QGIS using raster calculator
