Excellent work, [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)!  I live on a farm in Ohio, and we use cleanup from the chicken house and the horse/goat barns to make our compost piles.  It hadn't occurred to me to use the Riffle in this way, but this is an outstanding use of the technology.  The temperature profile very closely matches my experience and understanding of the process.

Because we usually end up with a couple of tons of compost at a run, it's always hard to tell when the composting process is finished, or the pile needs turned/watered/adjusted.  A project like this can take out a lot of the guesswork.
