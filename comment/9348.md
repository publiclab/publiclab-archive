Hi Doug,
I am not sure what kind of multi-potential steps you would want to do.  Right now we can do a number of voltage profiles, including voltage ramps, and one and two square voltage step experiments.  If you just want to set a voltage and deposit the oxide on the electrodes, that should be possible with the experiments we have.
If those experiments do not provide the voltage profile that you want, it is reasonably straight forward to write code for any new profile that you want. 
What kind of voltage profile are you trying to establish?
