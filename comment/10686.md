The commercial air flow meters are easy to use and come with NIST traceable certificates but you can make your own air flow meter for lab use that rivals the $1k meter performance.

There are many variations to this method but essentially you need a graduated cylinder column with a hose barb fitting.  Attach the air intake line to the column then time how long it takes a soap bubble to travel a portion of the column.  Calculate the flow rate as volume / time.

For the column, you can buy a cheap plastic graduated cylinder and then drill a hole in the base, tap the hole, then screw in a plastic barb fitting and goop on some silicone water sealant.  OR, you can use a graduated burette tube (like a pipette tube).  Wet the inside of the column with soapy water and then mount it in a lab stand with the open end facing down and the air hose fitting facing up.  Attach the air intake tube from your pump sampling apparatus to the column.  With air flowing in the open end, take a cup of soapy water and briefly submerge the open end of the column in the soapy water to make a soap bubble (alternatively, for higher flows you can blow bubbles in the cup with a straw and just touch the bubbles to the column).  With a stop watch, time how long it takes the soap bubble to pass a certain distance (volume) in the graduated cylinder.  The flow rate is then calculated as ( [end vol.] - [start vol.] ) / [time]  

You may want to add a water knock out to prevent any soapy water from entering the tube and fowling anything upstream.  For a knock out you just need any air tight container (e.g. mason jar, tupperware)  with a couple hose barbs.

You also need to size your column appropriately for your flow rates.  If measuring 0.1 to 1.0 lpm, I would consider using a 500 ml column.  If the bubble travels 400 ml in the column then it would take 240 to 24 seconds at 0.1 and 1.0 lpm respectively.  

I would check the flow of the system at at least four points and then make a correction curve if necessary--and it will probably be necessary. 

let me know if you have questions.
