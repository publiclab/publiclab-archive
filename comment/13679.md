[@liz](/profile/liz) & [@matej](/profile/matej) - did the polystyrene cuvettes last, or did they get melty? I like the nalgene-centric mixing process we used; much easier mixing and such in wide-mouth, larger volume containers, and then pouring into the cuvettes. 

[@silverhammer](/profile/silverhammer) and [@Matt_P](/profile/Matt_P) -- we're exploring using isopropyl as an evaporate-able solvent for oil analysis. Thanks for your posts and input on that!

[@ethanbass](/profile/ethanbass) -- check out this initial LED test data; we need a set of comparisons between oils in laser and LED -- can I ship you one? 

Thanks, everyone!
