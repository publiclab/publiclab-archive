That would be great, I've tried using Heroku where I had some issues using pgsql which was taking too much time to resolve.

I've updated the note with the [link](https://github.com/xvidun/mapknitter/tree/autoPlace), I usually push my commits atleast once in three days you can always find them at my [fork](https://github.com/xvidun/mapknitter) in one of the working branches.
