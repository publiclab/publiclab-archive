I am not familiar with the optics equations. My approach would be to enable precise adjustments of the components and find the best resolution (crispest diffraction pattern) by trial and error.

The voltages recorded for each cell of your sensor array will be a function of brightness. You will have to determine whether this function is linear. Then you will have the ability to measure the intensity of each wavelength in the spectral range of your device.

Absorbance (of a particular liquid) could be one of the applications of this device. You would compare the brightness of some wavelength band(s) with and without the liquid in the optical path.
