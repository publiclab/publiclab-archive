Hi [@jkpetter](/profile/jkpetter),  

It looks like a lot of your pole aerial photos are oblique (angled). If your goal is to make a map of the prairie area, photos taken with the camera always pointed straight down will be much easier to stitch together. Such nadir photos avoid much of the perspective distortion of oblique photos and can be more easily stitched into planar orthophoto images. If photos are taken throughout the seasons, different orthophotos (aerial map images) can be more easily compared to each other, especially if the same control markers (rocks, stakes) appear in each map. 

One easy way to ensure that the camera always points down is to suspend it from the pole with a hanging rod or stiffly flexible tubing, but there are other ways to get mostly nadir photos. Here are some research notes with photos and video of some DIY gadgets for controlling the angle of pole photos:
