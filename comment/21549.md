  Well, the sucrose absorbance is very low, but it's not zero.  See [Sucrose Absorbance](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Stark3/publication/26547496/figure/fig5/AS:214060537782297@1428047417621/UV-VIS-absorbance-spectrum-of-sucrose-solutions-over-10-mm-path-length-The-absorbance-at.png).  Since the data is 'clean' and the calculations match expectations, the result should be valid.

Thought refraction depended on angle of incidence and wavelength.  The angle is zero from light to grating, and the response is mostly flat across the visible wavelengths
