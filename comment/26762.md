Thanks [@warren](/profile/warren) for the quick reply!
Not exactly sure of what the keybinding means in this case - I highlighted an image and tried Q & A only, and then Q & A together with control, or command or option and nothing changed. Is there another combination I should try with the Q & A keys?
