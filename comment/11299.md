Yes, CIR, CCT and other lamp descriptions make knowing what you really get sometimes rather difficult. I have just added a section about calculating there uncertainties for this form of gain-correction and, with the 12V Solux, they look pretty good. As of suppliers, yes, it looks like primarily US: Amazon, Pegasus Lighting, Lamps Direct, etc. Also note that their other color temperature lamps do not have the same smooth spectral curve; the 4700K lamp is unique in this way.
