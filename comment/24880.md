[@crispinpierce](/profile/crispinpierce) [@OrionAllgaier](/profile/OrionAllgaier) I was thinking of how people may bridge from a Simple Air Sensor (or similar) to a Purple Air (#purple-air) or even a more expensive device like a dichotomous sampler or something. Trying to collect some ideas and thoughts here!
