Hi [@Manasa2850](/profile/Manasa2850), thanks for the proposal! I appreciate the combination of screenshots and code segments you've included. And the flow chart explaining a tag approval process - very readable! Also thanks for including a note on accessibility. 

I think the easiest way forward on the tagging would be the first option, of allowing only tags on one's own work. This avoids creating new systems and responsibilities for our moderators. However, we should think about how legible this is to new users - will they understand why they can't tag others' work, or will the understand when they've gained this new ability? What user interface hints or explanatory texts might we use to help this progression of privileges become more clear?

Thanks a lot!
