ttaylor you make some good points there. My cameras are not on a gimbal but directly connected to the drone (pure for kiss). Because of some gust the drone was not pointing in the same angle. I read your document, 720 nm looks indeed better. I have a 720 nm filter laying arround. Will try that. 
Thanks for the info. Have allot of testing to do. Will keep you guys posted.
