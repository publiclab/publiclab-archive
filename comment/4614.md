Yes, a large DOF can mean a less precise focus adjustment requirement, but near "infinity" the webcam just seemed out of focus over a wide DOF. That said, my main concern was falling into the trap of an increasing DOF with distance which did not provide the desired result of having the lens actually focused on the slit.

So, my objective is the combination of 1) a very narrow slit and 2) a sharp focus on that slit while avoiding focus issues at both ends of the focus range. That pointed toward what appears to be a more linear focusing adjustment region -- about 4-6 inches out. I also wanted a method to set the focus which reduced the amount of trial and error -- assuming the distance to the slit is a fixed value (i.e. it's harder to build with an adjustable slit distance). If devices have widely varying focus, their resolutions will vary as well and the measured data value will diminish. 

Thanks for the positive feedback.
