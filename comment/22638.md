Session idea: Empowerment and leadership discussion (1 hour) - I have a growing interest in questions like: At what point to people become empowered to just do things themselves? How do we help this happen? When do people want to become leaders and how does that happen?

I'd like to spend some time discussing this with people, especially around the space of Public Lab. PL has a somewhat novel approach to getting new people involved, and stories around people finding places of autonomy to do things with the tools on their own.
