[@Warren](/profile/Warren) I think this is an interesting way to show movement of fog droplets (10-20 um diameter, https://images.slideplayer.com/13/4090314/slides/slide_2.jpg) particularly if the fog can be seen moving (e.g., San Francisco Bay). Also, aerosols include both suspended solids and liquids so this model may be valuable for solids as well. However, liquid (fog) has different adsorption, absorption and surface tension characteristics that the particulates we traditionally measure and so would react differently (e.g., condense on surfaces) when moving through varying topography (e.g., buildings).

I wonder if the cocoa powder that [@Stevie](/profile/Stevie) has tried might be a teaching tool with the fans and sensors. The message being that we can be exposed to fine particulates (PM2.5) that we can smell and detect with an instrument, but can't see. Perhaps baby powder (or another aromatic powder) might also be useful.
