Mineral oil should work. I sometimes use on a professional immersion objectives a mixture of drugstore-bought liquid paraffin (sold as a laxative) and sewing machine oil. Both are just highly purified mineral oil. Liquid paraffin is thicker than sewing machine oil, mixing them in 1:1 ratio gives just the right viscosity.
The downside of using this mixture instead of a commercial immersion oil is that it's harder to clean. Cleaning objectives after each use is required in my lab, and getting rid of paraffin using microfibre cloth soaked in a bit of ethanol and diethyl ether is tedious as opposed to cleaning commercial immersion oils.
