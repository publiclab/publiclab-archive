Hi Dwight, wow sorry to hear it was damaged -maybe we should look into a different type of camera [@warren](/profile/warren) . Would have been great to catch some of that runoff footage! That's what Lee was able to use in the past talking to the county. Great pictures here though [@gretchen](/profile/gretchen) check these out.
