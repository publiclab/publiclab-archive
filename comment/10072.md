[@mathew](/profile/mathew) - I've been thinking about Riffle data and just posted a research note about it: [MapKnitter Annotations: Riffle Data as Map Annotations](http://publiclab.org/notes/justinmanley/08-19-2014/mapknitter-annotations-riffle-data-as-map-annotations).  I think that a more useful approach might be to provide a few d3 / Leaflet templates that would automatically visualize a small susbet of the Riffle data directly on the map.

Take a look at the research note and let me know what you think.
