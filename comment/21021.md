Wow, this is very cool!!! I think there has been some previous work on this at [#hyperspectral](/tag/hyperspectral) but you've gotten much further!

> #### MaterialsPublic lab smart phone spectrometer, Moto x4 phone, and image processing software. This approach should work with other spectrometers and video capture devices too. I will eventually open source the code I'm using for this when it's cleaned up and in a more complete state.

> 
> 1. Use the smart phone spectrometer to capture a video of a well illuminated scene where the spectrometer is slowly panned from the top to the bottom of the region of interest. Keeping the panning at a uniform speed will reduce the amount of distortion in the final image. A mechanical device could be useful here.

> Use image processing software to correct for the warping and any rotational error so that the spectrum is completely horizontal. I used the OpenCV distortion function with parameters I determined by eyeballing the result. In future work, this step could be automated. The next image shows the undistorted spectrum with a blue line that was horizontal in the original image to illustrate the amount of warping: ![image description](https://publiclab.org/i/27323.png "warped.PNG")

> #### Results
> 
> Below is a reconstructed image of my kitchen window/sink.The red, blue and green channels where chosen from single steps in the corresponding sections of the spectrum. Any pixel in the image could be sampled to view a full spectrum. I applied some vertical stretching to correct for some warping caused an insufficient the number of frames. ![image description](https://publiclab.org/i/27324.png "tempsnip.png")
> 
> There are some obvious misalignment in the color channels around the edges. This is mostly caused by the warping issue I mentioned in step two of the procedure. Camera shake is causing some distortion that is visible along the window frame in the center of the image. The camera I am using is also causing some issues. It cannot pick up low light levels so many areas appear completely dark that would be illuminated in a normal image (this was taken in sunlight). Furthermore, there are some gaps in the spectrum that it captures between the RGB bands.

> #### Next Steps
> 
> Try to create another image with better undistortion and a slower, steadier panning motion.
