Those regressions look really encouraging. I guess if I took some photos with my own A2200 and Wratten 25A filter (the same model and filter type you used) and captured RAW images, you would be able to process them into believable NDVI with values that were comparable to your NDVI. And I would not even have to take photos of your spectral targets. I guess we are still not at the point where I would want to do the processing myself unless maybe there was a Fiji plugin just for this camera.

If you can get this to work for jpegs, do you think there is a chance that a Fiji plugin (or Infragram.org routine) could take photos from any camera model and filter combination that had been calibrated and with only the knowledge about which camera and filter had been used, make calibrated NDVI? Would it matter what white balance had been used on those cameras? Would those photos have to include targets?

The possibilities are exciting.
