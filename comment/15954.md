Chris, 

I am now able to measure my spectra using iPhone, i dont know why using mobile device is way more effective than PC. Also, how do you callibrate the intensity? My idea was finding the correction factor by dividing the data i got from spectraworkbench with the intensity value from Planck's Black body radiation (Since i use CFL, the manufacturer put its specifications including its CCT). 

Best Regards,
