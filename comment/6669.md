I was in Saugatuck MI in the state park.  Unfortunately the wind was all but nonexistent while I was there and I was never able to get the kite in the air for more than a couple of seconds.  The forecast looks weak for this weekend as well; so at best I will be able to fine tune the kite, but I doubt I will be able to launch the rig.
