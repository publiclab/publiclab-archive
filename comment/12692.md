Thanks, Chris - we were testing a different bugfix -- there were two. This latest change fixed an issue with [@callouts](/profile/callouts) not triggering email sends at all -- which has apparently been the case for quite some time due to a bug in a related change. There's now an automated test to ensure that it doesn't get disabled again. 

The spam folder issue is separate but we are also addressing that soon.
