This collecting of the Riffle documentation is much needed, thanks for giving it a shot!  i'm interested in [@warren](/profile/warren) and [@liz](/profile/liz)'s thoughts on this info going in the wiki directly at [/open-water](/wiki/open-water) or [/riffle](/wiki/riffle).

[@Donblair](/profile/Donblair)'s intention is to have the instructions versioned with supporting hardware, software, and libraries on the github repository.  how much of that info belongs on activity pages, or should the activity pages link to the repository info?
