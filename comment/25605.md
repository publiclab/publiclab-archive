I had originally installed only the arduino "core" package which has the compiler and library stuff to work with arduinos. I tried installing the raspbian arduino IDE package, but it's pretty old, so I downloaded and installed the newest arduino IDE. It turns out, that they've lately added a bunch of command-line functionality!

You can run the graphic package on the Raspberry Pi (rather than only interacting with the command line). You can even run it via X-windows, so that would be another way students could do the programming on their personal computer without having to be connected directly to the arduino. 

There are a bunch of ways you can network arduinos (e.g. hats with radios or wifi or ethernet). And for some projects, students might want to learn how to do that.  

And, as my new note indicates, the Raspberry Pi can be the server! (e.g. running a webserver in this case).  ssh (secure shell) is useful not only to allow you securely connect to the raspberry pi, but you can also tunnel other kinds of connections, so you don't have to expose services to the internet where attackers can poke at them.
