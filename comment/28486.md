I want to recognize this proposal's thoroughness, great work! I love that you're basing everything around migrations, which is just excellent. One thing that will come up is that we have a test server with a full copy of the live database on it. After doing local tests of migrations, you can push them to this server at https://unstable.publiclab.org in order to see how they run on a real live (giant) database. However, it's important to be able to push a rollback as well, or to otherwise be able to recover the db state so you can correct errors. For this reason I recommend we think through a) if it's worthwhile to be very careful about making reversible changes in our migrations, with the "up/down" workflow, AND/OR coordinating with our sysadmin ([@icarito](/profile/icarito) in chatroom and on GitHub) in order to find a way to recover a db snapshot or otherwise roll back state. 

One other thing is that a lot of the migration of Answers to Comments is complete. Your plan for it is just right, however, I think we can skip several steps as all Answers have already been converted and I believe we can now simply delete those records. Small change, but thanks!

Thanks a lot for this detailed plan!
