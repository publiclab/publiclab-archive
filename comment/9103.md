Good call on the power control chip -- for the riffle-ito design, I'm just using an LDO, which should provide a relatively clean signal?  But yeah, there is some op-amp trickery that Ben is expert in that I need to grok soon ...

TOTALLY SPACED on the awesome 1/8" mini-jack idea!! I need to order some right now.

Also: do you have any leads on a simple tutorial / breakout for generating an audio signal from e.g. an UNO?  I'm looking to play with 'audio out' -- e.g. just play back the last week's worth of conductivity data as an audio signal -- so folks could tell immediately whether the conductivity history over the last week was 'spiky' or 'smooth' ... i'm imagining a daily 'metronome beep' for reference ... and maybe folks could even record the data onto a smartphone via an audio cable, for later upload to a site ...
