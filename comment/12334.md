Hi,  Dave - have you had any success reproducing the kind of wavelength drift shown in the example by [@priyanka](/profile/priyanka) above? Having an idea of how much force and what kind of force can cause drift is an important first step in determining if we need further reinforcement. 

I think [@ygzstc](/profile/ygzstc) is going to post soon proposing an easy way to dramatically improve grating/webcam stability, but we need a baseline assessment of stability in the current design to see if it's an improvement.
