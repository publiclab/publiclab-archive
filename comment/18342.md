Just wondering, how did you confirm that the particles that illuminate are silica? Lots of different minerals (based on their anisotropic nature) should illuminate under polarized light. Did you perform some sort of alternate analysis to verify these are silica. Common silicates, carbonates, etc should also illuminate - and the degree of illumination has to do with their birefringence and their orientation (i.e., with respect to the polarization angle) when you view/image. Very interested to hear more as I have also thought about this type of analysis for specific applications in airborne particulate research.
