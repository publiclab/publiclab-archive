Good job. I am inspired to work on a similar project.  I love the way you recycle what most see as junk!  A man after my own heart.

I made a spectrometer for a digital camera a few years ago, but it was much bulkier than yours, and included a collimating lens.  One thing I noticed with it was that the relative line intensities would change depending on the angle between the slit and the object I was trying to measure.  To overcome that I added an imaging lens in front of the slit to make an image of the object on the slit, and that seemed to overcome the problem.  Without the imaging lens, some of the CFL lines at the end of the spectrum could completely drop off.  I do not understand why.  Anyway, the thing was too bulky and I did not do much with it.  Now I am motivated to  incorporate some of your fabrication methods to try again.
