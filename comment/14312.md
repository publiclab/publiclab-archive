Mathew, I haven't seen any spectral data for Rosco paints. Is there any reason to think that they would be better than other paints for NDVI calibration targets?

This sounds like a business opportunity for someone with access to a spectrometer. Buy a few shades of gray paint, paint some plywood squares, get a spectral scan of each color, sell the squares with the spectral data. International shipping is a plus.
