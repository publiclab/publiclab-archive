Hi jalarid, Yes that is correct. There is lots of active development about which cameras and filters work best, and how to get the most meaningful NDVI from the infrablue photos. Check out related research notes (http://publiclab.org/tag/infragram) and forum discussions (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/plots-infrared).
