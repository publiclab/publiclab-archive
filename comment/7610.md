Hi Taylor. Your right that the LED is limited in the wavelengths it emits. I have made another design that uses a halogen bulb which covers ~350nm to far in the IR region and has a long working life. The only drawback is the heat it produces. I am collaborating with Dr. Summers (http://publiclab.org/profile/JSummers) on improving the design and hope to have some stuff written up soon (a project at work has been slowing me down). 

The diffraction grating I am using comes from here: http://www.carolina.com/physical-science-light-and-optics/diffraction-grating/755230.pr?catId=&mCat=&sCat=&ssCat=&question=diffraction+grating
