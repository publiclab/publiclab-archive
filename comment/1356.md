Hi, beckman - I think i may have fixed the profile issue, check out this update:

http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/9-18-2012/spectral-workbench-updates-profile-page-fix-sample-row-selection

But what exactly goes wrong? Is it fixed now? I should be able to fix your profile and you shouldn't have to make a new one. What URL do you see an error for?

Very interesting about the "blanking" protocol... once we get you up and running, would you be able to go into more detail on that? I've been recording a "baseline" as shown in the first video on this page:  http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/spectral-workbench-usage

is "using a spectrum as a baseline" different from blanking?
