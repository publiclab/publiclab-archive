With the Infrablue filter there is both visible and NIR light hitting the camera sensor and it would be helpful to know how different wavelengths are recorded so we can better separate the visible and NIR information. With a DIY NIR camera there is some visible light getting past the filter (unexposed developed film) and it would be helpful to know what impact that has on the image being recorded. If you are certain that only NIR ligth is hitting the sensor then I agree characterization is less critical unless of course you want to be able to quantify the intensity by measuring radiance.
