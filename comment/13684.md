I agree Jeff on the toxicity of using Hexane as a solvent, that's why I have been using Isopropyl 91%. I also have been using Ethanol (C2H5OH,) it's a mix of Ethanol denatured with Isopropyl alcohol and MIBK 200 proof, it also dissolves both polar and non-polar substances. 

acrylic (PMMA) isn't that resistant to ethanol in concentrations above 20-30%. (something to keep in mind.) There are quite a few other plastics that withstand it well though, such as HDPE and PET.
