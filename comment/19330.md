[@imvec](/profile/imvec) I already have a nonprofit dealing with factory farm pollution that is interested in having me present your awesome tool. A few questions: 
If someone wants to remain anonymous, can they just choose a location nearby, but not exactly their GPS coordinates? 
Can people see the map without an account login? 
Is this a Beta or is it ready to use now? So far I see one data point on the map.

Thanks so much!
