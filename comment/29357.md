That would be great if I could reference some parts and the way the machine is set up mechanically thank you! I may be able to make a simpler replicate using an arduino possibly. I have gone to the lab to take a look at the environment that I will be working with and these are what the plates look like and there is no background to contrast the roots unfortunately it is clear plates with no soil background.
