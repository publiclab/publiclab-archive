-	This is so cool.  Clears up some misconceptions. I thought Blurred Leaflet was part of Leaflet Environment layers!  Now I know they are separate.
-	One suggestion is to update this chart or create a separate chart that identifies the software application.  While I know this is for software developers, it would also be useful to have a ‘user’ ecosystem map.    Links  could also  be embedded in the chart so you would have a single graphic that shows all of Public Lab software offerings.   Something like:

-	It  may also be possible  to show how the different GSOC/Outreachy programs contribute to the roadmap.    I put together a comparison chart to 
 show the different efforts but a relationship graphic may have been a better approach.  Copy and paste the link below to see GSOC comparison  excel chart:

- Another idea is  to add documentation status as one of the roadmap markers.   I have started to work on an Image Sequencer user manual and am still looking for some missing info.   Can you please review the draft outline and see if it’s missing any areas before a general post that will ask for the missing info?

- Also interested in what the processing environment of the core site looks like?   Adding opencv.js requires a specific  build environment and I am not sure how to approach the update.     See https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/da1/tutorial_js_setup.html for the build requirements.
