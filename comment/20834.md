Hi [@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2) , you are awesome for re-working the wiring diagram! i just followed your updated instructions in preparation for doing this activity with young people in a couple weeks. Works great. Would love if you could post this diagram in its own note so we can promote it as the primary assembly activity for the store's version of the Coqui. Let me know if i can help make a draft or something. 

My next goal is to slow the high-pitched buzzer down to be lower in tone and slow enough to be able to hear the separate clicks that are slower or faster depending on the conductivity of the solution. I am trying the different capacitors -- the black one that looks like a small barrel, and one that looks like the tan-blob-on-stilts. Can you recommend / draw how to either use the various capacitors or somehow add the resistor? The parts that i have available are depicted here: https://store.publiclab.org/collections/education/products/coqui-bbv1-0-conductivity-sensor

Thank you!
