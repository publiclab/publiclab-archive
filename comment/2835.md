Try looking at the cfl bulb directly with the cover off to see if the camera is working right. If you get a bright light doing this, then you most likely have an alignment problem.  I get the brightest signal on mine when I keep my light source about 5-10 degrees to the left of center when I shine it at the source due to a minor misalignment on my part.  It works fine that way since I am manually line up any absorbance readings anyway.  Play with the light anlges while the spec sits level on a flat surface and see if that helps?
