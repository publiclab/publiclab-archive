Thanks for the response! I bought a paper and desktop, hoping the two extremes would be good enough for me. I would need a Raspberry Pi to use the camera, though. That's not too much of an issue since I can interface with Matlab  to program, but I'm looking for a stupid simple setup. Sounds like any webcam will do. I want wavelengths >700nm. I vaguely recall reading that the pi camera has up to 1000nm. Anway, I guess this lets me shell out for a nicer more accurate wider range camera :D
