Note: Their UV source was a PTI LS-100 fluorescence spectrophotometer -- no longer sold. From a google books print, it sounds like a variable-wavelength device which allowed measurement resolutions of 3nm. So, it might not be laser-based, but clearly (from the article, the excitation wavelength could be controlled and, from the google books reference, the bandwidth was relatively narrow (within the resolution of the PLab hardware.
