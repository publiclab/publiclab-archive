Hi, it depends on how big your balloon is and what it's made of. If you use a rubber balloon, it'll deflate over a day or two. If you use mylar, like in the [Mini Balloon Kit](/wiki/mini-balloon-kit), you can keep it inflated for a few weeks, so I think that may be a good answer for you. Have you considered using kites, too?
