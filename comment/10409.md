some more info on airborne laser induced oil spill detection and fluorescence measurements in Germany are here:  http://www.havariekommando.de/en/cis/inventory/Aircraft/57_01/

Classification of various crude oils in flight appeare to be possible.
I remeber that Optimare used also a green laser in its Medusa sensor-
My understanding at the time was that fluorescence was observed in the very thin oil film floating on top of the water which could have acted as an almost perfect reflector having a potentially big surface.
