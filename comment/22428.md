Try radish. They are easy to find as garden seeds this time of year. Other mustards are probably good too (cabbage, arugula, any mustard green). But radish seeds are a little bigger than many mustard greens.

But for easier photography, a bigger bean seed might be better. 

The germination of most garden seeds is strongly sensitive to temperature. At 80°F radish seeds might germinate overnight, but at 55° it can take a week.

If the seeds are big enough, do an experiment and rub each seed against fine sandpaper. See if they germinate faster than side-by-side seeds which are not scarified. 

Or drizzle vinegar on half of the seeds.

Or put a heating pad under half of the seeds. Or put half of the seeds nearer to a cold (not sunny) window.

Also, it takes a day or so for many seeds to imbibe water. Soak the seeds for a day on wet paper towels in a cool place. Then move to a warm place and start the photography. The germination will happen independent of the more variable imbibing process and be somewhat synchronized.

So maybe use a big photogenic bean seed, but soak them for a day or two before photography starts, and then keep the temperature above 75°F.

Or just wait for the seeds to start germinating before you start the photography.

Other good 24 hour timelapse science observations:

- cut apples, bananas, or potatoes browning 
- lettuce or flowers wilting 
- dehydrated houseplants recovering 
- indoor snowman or ice sculpture melting
