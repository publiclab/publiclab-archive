Hi [@pataxte](/profile/pataxte)! Amanda here from the store. I can see how the different set ups are a bit confusing. I took a look at the mount and it seems that there are actually multiple ways to assemble - with the camera on the top, side, or bottom of the clamp. This works well because, as you mentioned, people may be working with a wide variety of cameras that all have their mounts in different locations.
If you use your attachment like in I've added below, and mount your camera from the bottom so it is facing the ground, would that help? My understanding is that the camera does not need to be entirely parallel to the ground to capture results, and the pole will have a slight lean in one direction as well. 
Great question! I hope that helps a bit, please let me know your thoughts. This is excellent feedback that we can use to improve our kits and instructions!
