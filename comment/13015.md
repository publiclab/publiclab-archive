the software directions are looking real promising! as for hardware, I think you're absolutely right, [@Donblair](/profile/Donblair)-- Expose the RTC alarm and let users wire it to a pin. 

[@SteveHicks](/profile/SteveHicks) I believe Don is using the DS3231-- I asked about the alarm function because I figured don had chosen it for the alarm-- he had actually chosen it because its thermally stable.
