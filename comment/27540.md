Hi. Thank you for the feedback ðŸ˜ƒ 

Since in the existing components we are using one api call to fetch all of the data, we will only have one api call so as to keep the codebase consistent.
So now based on the new requirements and design, we might have to re-work the existing api or build a new one that best suits the use case.
I am not sure weather or not the apis require a full re-work right at this moment.
