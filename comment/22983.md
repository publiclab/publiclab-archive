I agree that the DFRobot TDS sensor looks like a useful device at a good price. My lame understanding is that this and other sensors which purport to report Total Dissolved Solids are just conductivity sensors. This one has two metal probes and is obviously measuring the current passing through water. When most of the solids dissolved in water are salts, electrical conductivity is well correlated with the concentration of dissolved solids. When a lot of the solids dissolved in water are organic compounds or other stuff, the correlation is weaker. It might be a stretch to call this a TDS sensor, but in some situations TDS is so similar to EC that converting EC to TDS provides adequate results.

I don't know how effective it is to use their trick of alternating the current to avoid the problem of hydrolyzing water near the probes (I guess that's the goal of this). I don't know what voltage they pass between the probes, but maybe it is very low. The sensor includes a well-populated PCB, so maybe they keep the current to the probes at a low voltage. They would probably tell us if we asked.
