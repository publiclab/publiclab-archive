Do you pull those into an application which can handle images with floats? To make sure if both images are the same just plot them in a scatter plot just as I did with my [NDVI / EVI comparison](http://publiclab.org/n/11808). If you have biases or binning in either image it will show up. Just looking at the images won't tell you much.
