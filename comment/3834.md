=max(blue:red) is soo much easier. Thanks.

The greater of three method seems to be useful for transmission or absorption spectra when a continuous light source is used. It can be more or less valid even when one channel is blown out, although that situation means information has been lost no matter what you do. The algorithm could switch to the next highest channel when one is blown. If more than one channel is blown out, an additional algorithm might be needed to choose a channel, although blown channels all have the same value so it might not matter which was chosen.

For emission spectra, the greater of three approach should not be used when channels are blown out. Often a secondary channel allows an emission peak to be resolved. If a channel is blown out, a complex algorithm might be needed to preserve the peaks better than an average does. If no channel is blown out, the greater of three approach would generally produce a spectrum with higher and more distinct peaks. But the relative heights of peaks might change, so interpreting the relative intensity of each peak would be tricky. However, interpreting the relative intensity of the peaks when an average is used is also problematical.  

Almost all of the CFL spectra I have uploaded to Spectral Workbench have blown out peaks, so the greater of three approach might not be applicable very often for CFL. But many of my other gas discharge tube spectra have no blown out peaks and might look better with the greater of three approach.  

So it would be good to have the greater of three method as an alternate display, but people will have to be made aware of the ramifications of its use.
