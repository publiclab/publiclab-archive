Hi [@ajitmujumdar25999](/profile/ajitmujumdar25999) -- I wanted to share my feedback here as well!

> Ajit did a great job thoroughly understanding not only several interlocking i18n systems and debugging them, but also understanding the challenges of a multi-step 3rd party integration with Transifex. What’s more, Ajit worked from the input and suggestions of the translator/reviewer community, prioritizing and implementing fixes responsively. The hardest part of this project was understanding the complete loop of the translation workflow, and making that legible to the team of admins who will be facilitating that workflow. Thanks to Ajit for attention to detail, persistence and patience, and for being agreeable and enjoyable to work with!

Thank you for all your hard work!!
