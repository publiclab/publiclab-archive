I have pictures of three different kinds: true color, 560nm IR filter, and 720nm IR filter, and I've been having the difficulty of choosing which channel from IR photo to choose.
How did you choose? 
Which channel did you use with the 720nm IR filter?
Did you or didn't you modify your IR camera, to take off the IR block filter?

And another question for all you guys, I have to exactly equal cameras, and was considering modifying one.
But I am not sure whether to choose the blue filter, or the wratten 25A filter to insert inside the camera once I remove de IR block filter.

Can I close the camera with NO filter, and try them on the outside, like a normal filter?

Thanks
Rita
