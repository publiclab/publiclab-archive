Thanks for posting this Jeff. The results are interesting. Most of the LEDs that I've seen have band widths in the 5nm - 10nm range. It's important to remember that band width is usually calculated as the full width at half maximum (FWHM) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_width_at_half_maximum] so what we see on the graph will appear (at least it does for me) broader than the actual specification. That said, some of these still seem to be broader than (what I expect are) the specs. 

Adding a FWHM calculation in the spectral workbench might be a helpful tool.
