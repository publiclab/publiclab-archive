I've recently tried with a Nikon D700 + Elmarit 35mm with good results.</br>
If  you have an extra lens cap you can try making a hole and fix the spectrometer to it.</br>
Also browsing the PL website just found this interesting post by [@dhaffnersr](/profile/dhaffnersr) about CFL calibration (Compact Fluorescent Light).</br>
