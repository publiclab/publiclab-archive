Hello [@warren](/profile/warren) I have tried to answer your first 3 points you made.

1. I added the current state and future state of swagger in our project.
2. I added a CSV support for statistical data and how I am planning to implement it. ([@liz](/profile/liz))
3. I explained how api/srch/* files are connected to services file by taking the example of stats feature I will implement. (If need I can explain more. For now, you can think it of as services in Angular-4/5 and how they work for a component).
4. For token based auth feature I am researching more on best practice and will update in a day.

And yes [@mkashyap354](/profile/mkashyap354) I am working on an issue https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/2469 in plot2 and before that I have a PR merged in ImageSequencer. I will try to solve more is time allow

Thanks to all, and I am looking forward to do this. Let me know your point of view on this.
