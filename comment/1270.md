Thanks for the comment on the note. It provides a terrific perspective on the difference between personally made maps vs the automatically generated ones. Very thoughtful and balanced. The automated approaches really seem to be coming up with more folks flying autonomous drone missions and wanting the processing of images to be automated as well. As an example of the difference in approach, I still recall your pointing out the choice to include a view of graffiti on a wall on the <a href="http://archive.publiclaboratory.org/leaflet/?tms=http://archive.publiclaboratory.org/new-york-city/2011-07-31-brooklyn-gowanus/tms/&lon=-73.9892264304&lat=40.6774821627&zoom=17">Gowanus map</a> when you were explaining your PhotoShop workflow.
