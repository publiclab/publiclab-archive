Hello,
I know this thread is quite inactive but maybe someone with experience is still hanging around. I have a question regarding navigating the balloon during slight winds. Would it work to attach the balloon to three lines that are spread to a triangle at the ground to limit horizontal movement of the balloon? I know that this would add more load and limit possible heights as the spreading on the ground needs to be larger than the height but still.... Am I missing something in my thoughts?

Thank you for any explanation!
