Hi Gretchen,  
The Public Lab infrared images you refer to here are not thermal images. The near infrared photos don't have any information about temperature but are useful for studying plants because of the unique way chlorophyll reflects near infrared light. Also, the infrared map you link to at mapknitter.org has spam in the description field, which sort of detracts from the message.
