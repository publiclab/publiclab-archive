[@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2) Yeah, the area the office is is actually near the part of Providence (the port) with the most industrial polluters. See the map below of EPA-regulated industrial polluters in Providence. 

However, the PurpleAir is known to read higher values then actual. The Rhode Island Dept of Environmental Management forecasters are saying it is currently AQI 65 but that there was a high today of 115 in Providence.
