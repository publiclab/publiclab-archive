Hi! have you tried using a trail camera? The simple ones don't send the images to the internet so you would need to collect them from the SD card, but their batteries last at least a week . Also you can set up a gauge board to help with the measuring. These stay in place, you can face your camera to point at them so you don't have to check it every day. 

Good luck! Keep us posted!
