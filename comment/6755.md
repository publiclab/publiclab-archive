Hi Jeff,

Sorry I was away from internet for a while and just seeing this.  The place where we were trying is generally a pretty good place to look for blooms but they have been slow to show up this summer.  I'm told by a colleague that there might be something on the river now.  But if I can't find anything, I may go to a nearby lake to see if I can get something a little more easily.   In any case, I plan to do a lot more on this next summer.

Thanks!
