When we were in WI [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke), [@mathew](/profile/mathew), and I were visiting some friends and we took a sample from a window at their house. The house window was facing a frack sand mine and appeared to be covered with a thin dust layer. We used a small razor and scraped the window in a downward fashion onto a slide. Since we just wanted to look at the materials that came off of the window under a microscope, we weren't worried about the sample size, contamination or anything like that. Made it pretty simple.  I know [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1) did something neat with tape on a rock recently as well.
