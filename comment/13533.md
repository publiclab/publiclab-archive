Great to hear about your initiative!!! Check out NYC's initiative https://treescount.nycgovparks.org/ that used the TreeKIT method developed by [@philipsilva](/profile/philipsilva) and I to help thousands of New Yorkers map over half a million street trees (and counting!). Happy to answer any questions.
