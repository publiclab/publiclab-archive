Hello Dr. Summers,I've tested both the Energia code for the Tiva C board, and the Prcessing GUI.It all compiles properly and runs as advertised.I would be interested in the eagle sch. files so I can get the component values for the shield that I'm working on.I appreciate your offer on the extra suface mount
board you have,however I'm using through-hole components on my board.When it is built,I'm planning to share some of my application ideas here. Again,Thanks in advance!
   Regards, Mark Rairie
