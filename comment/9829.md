Oh cool! do you want to post your LUT in a numeric format so we can post it as an Infragram.org option?

The format is: 

    colormap = segmented_colormap([[0, [0, 0, 255], [38, 195, 195]], [0.5, [0, 150, 0], [255, 255, 0]], [0.75, [255, 255, 0], [255, 50, 50]]]);

where the outermost `[ ]` contain a set of `[x-position,[r,g,b]]` items -- x-position measured from 0-1.

And a name for your LUT and a place to link to for more information about it. Maybe http://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram-luts ?
