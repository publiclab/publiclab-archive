I'm interested in piggybacking [particle sensors](/wiki/particle-sensing) onto weather stations-- does yours let you plug in new sensors?  existing commercial sensors are usually hooked up to expensive commercial connections, and [need other weather data for calibration](/notes/Jdahlen/06-24-2014/dissecting-humidity-from-particle-count-in-frac-sand-sampling)

It seems there's a big community of people running weather stations and it would be really cool to add to their existing monitoring.
