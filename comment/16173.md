[@warren](/profile/warren), [@rthalman](/profile/rthalman) I will share the build details once I get some fotos. The public library operates on a cost recovery system so the cost of the project was about $12 cdn for all 3 pieces. I sent them the *.stl files and in a couple of days picked them up. The only fly in the ointment is the que to start. The webcam mod took most of the time. I would be interested in the paper version file as well.
