I'm having a hard time figuring out to approve this or not. While there might be a reason to publish info on trying to make a drone to kill lionfish (invasive species or ill effects on environment) this is still a post on making something that is intended to harm a animal. I did look at the facebook page and this project seems like something interesting but given that this is using a unmanned underwater drone to kill something I'm a bit worried. Now if the work was to use a drone to spray some kind of deterrent I could approve but not this. I suggest emailing or talking with other PL moderators if the OP wishes this to get published.
