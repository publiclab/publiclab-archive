I can't help with shift registers, but I have had good luck running a 1602 LCD with just two data pins (and two power) using a [serial interface module](https://www.google.com/search?q=IIC+I2C+TWI+SP%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8BI+Serial+Interface+1602+LCD&oq=IIC+I2C+TWI+SP%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8BI+Serial+Interface+1602+LCD&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) that turns the LCD into an I2C device. These cost as little as US$0.76 and get soldered onto the back of the LCD. I [bought them on ebay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-IIC-I2C-TWI-SP-I-Serial-Interface-1602-LCD-Screen-Module-For-Arduino/252973775316?_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIM.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D45041%26meid%3D39c2da28858944d7b25523367db9b5e9%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D4%26rkt%3D6%26mehot%3Des%26sd%3D352103345843). No need for any code to load or unload a register.
