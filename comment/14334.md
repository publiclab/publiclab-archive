As a follower of this discussion, asking couple questions-

First, does electric charge of the particles play a role in dust collection?
This question first occurred to me when thinking about dust from sand mines.  Silica particles are crushed, and sometimes blasted, they may have a piezoelectric charge. Also, when reading about cloud formation, there are often references to the charge of the particle around which the water condenses.

Most articles discuss sulfates and organic compounds. There's an interesting recent article concerning mineral dusts-

2 questions from this-
1] does ionization of the dust particles affect the collection process-how does the charge of the particle interact with the collection instrument? Plus, I'm wondering about static electricity. Dust explosions are another issue that raised my curiosity.

2] In high humidity, is moisture adhering to a fine/ultra-fine particle?
