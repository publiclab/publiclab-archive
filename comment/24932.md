For sure, and I think we're on the same page on the need for lower cost monitoring. One thing we're asked a lot though is some variation on "once something is well explored with low cost monitors, can we use just a few higher-end ones in concert with them to further shore up the evidence?" so it'll be interesting to see whether this ends up being not a "one or the other" but rather an "all of the above" strategy. 

Thanks, these are really good questions to use in planning how to put these to use!
