Hi Steven,

This type of analysis should be viable. I have not seen examples of pure NIR photos providing more information than good normal photos of [crop marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cropmark). But an index like NDVI should be able to discern more subtle differences in plant stress. You might have to exploit the [red edge](http://lms.seos-project.eu/learning_modules/agriculture/agriculture-c01-s02.html) to see subtle changes in the reflectance of red and NIR that happen as plants become stressed.  
[![reflectance2.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/109/medium/reflectance2.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/109/original/reflectance2.jpg)  

So you might need two cameras each with rather narrow bands: one red and one NIR. I took photos with such cameras last week and will try to post a research note this week. There were crops (but no crop marks) in the photos.
