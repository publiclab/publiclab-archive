node: Why do raw RGB values differ from calibrated RGB values? I thought calibration just set pixels to wavelength (nm)?

Thanks very much for the prompt and numerous replies. I think they add up to an answer.  There is a small difference in the intensity of the calibrated values, relative to raw uncalibrated values. I made the attached figure to show this. I gather from the replies from stoft that this isn't intended. The difference is small, but I think it may be largest at low values (less than 10 on the scale of 0 to 255).

I also included our experimental results in the attached figure as a second panel.

I'm pleased to say that I've now calculated results and the experiment worked very well. We measured algae with and without an alum treatment that removes phosphorous from the water. The alum makes a flocculent in the water, and our measurements (at 90° to a 20W cool white LED light source) distinguished the 'greenness' of algae (chlorophyll reflects green light, absorbs blue) from the higher reflectance of alum. I suggested we use a normalised difference index (green – blue)/(green + blue) after subtracting baseline (violet).
