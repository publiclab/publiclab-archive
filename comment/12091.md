Time and humidity can be controlled for.

Take 4 to 8 tubes. Do whatever it is you do before putting them in the fridge, but put them in: fridge no tupperware, in tupperware in fridge, in a cabinet no tupperware, in tupperware in a cabinet. 8 tubes would be for testing pairs in the same location which gives you repetitions for more significant results.

If you check all 4-8 the next day and they all turn pink, it is likely (but not necessarily) a matter of time. Non-ziplocs only? Probably humidity or some air contaminant.
