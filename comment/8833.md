The sodium rhodizonat isn't toxic according to the SDS I just looked at.  The cost of the chemical itself might be a little prohibitive, but searching for it I stumbled across a YouTube video on making a related chemical potassium rhodizinate, which would do the same thing, since it is the rhodizinate anion that is important for the reaction and not the alkali metal cation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLmycZ2nrt0 .
There are of course, other colored lead precipitates which although they'd probably be more cost effective and/or easier to obtain.
