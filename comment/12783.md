Hi Ethan,

Your CFL spectra look really good. It's not that common to resolve both of those green lines with a PL spectrometer, so you must have done a good job assembling yours. That's a good point that everyone should be aware that the big green peak is really two peaks. I think the new calibration procedure at Spectral Workbench 2.0 mostly solves this problem by displaying an image of a spectrum with both peaks as you calibrate. I think version 2.0 actually works and saves your results, so you should be able to use it now. Jeff should confirm that though.

Chris
