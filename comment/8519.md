Pascal, Thanks. Hope my posted note on HDR2 is readable.

Just a thought on the 'stepped-slit'. I constructed a number of them with the idea of forming recognizable 'separate' spectral bands which could have "known" relative intensity differences -- I used 3dB and 6dB. While I did find some gradation in intensity, it was by no means definable steps. The results I've seen posted so far suggest this is not an easy thing to construct. However, those experiments are what lead to just using the inherent intensity variation across the imaged band and measure that curve since there's nothing magical about steps other than convenience. I'm now more convinced that more accurate response curves are possible w/o modifying the hardware. I mentioned to Jeff that if he'd select a (full image) spectra with less than optimal, curved bands, I'd tweak my algorithm and post the results. I think such an algorithm is within reach and could be made rugged enough for general automated use.

Cheers, Dave
