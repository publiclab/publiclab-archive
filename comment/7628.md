That's a really original design. 80 grams for the rig is nice. I like the way the Picavet arm serves to protect the camera, and the way the camera controls are more accessible than in a soda bottle rig. I think you're right that slimmer stock would have plenty of strength for this. The best part of the design is the way one piece of bent aluminum serves as legs, camera attachment, camera protection, and suspension attachment. This got me thinking of modifications to exploit that concept. Your design is kind of a hybrid between Picavet (four rig-attachment points) and pendulum (hanging from one line-attachment). Your design eliminates an advantage of both the Picavet and the pendulum. They both damp or prevent spinning, but your single string attachment does not, so you added a vane. That vane will be a problem on no wind ballooning days when the rig slowly spins until the vane hits the balloon line and then starts bouncing back and forth, possibly increasing spinning motion. 

The Picavet version below would be for kiting when a two point attachment to the kite line will damp motion. The pendulum version is for kites or balloons. The attachment to the line would be like [Becot's design](http://becot.info/rigs/anglais/cradleFMR2.htm) which damps swing and eliminates spinning.  Both of these designs not only make the camera controls accessible but make it easy to see the LCD (both are essential features). The legs could be extended and wrapped into a cage to protect the camera as much as you want. Once the 3/4" aluminum stock is split lengthwise it should be easy to shape. These designs do not pack away very compactly, but you can't have everything.

In the Picavet version it is important to keep the four Picavet eyes well above the camera (the center of mass) so it will self-level. Also, my rectangle of eyes might not work as well as a square or diamond. In the pendulum version the upper arm has to bend in so it is centered over the mass. I guess we have to call these the Gumby rigs.
