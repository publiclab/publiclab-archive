Hi Chris,
Thanks! I hadn't thought about using a red card to set the white balance, but it makes sense.
I understand what you are saying about leaf-to-leaf variation within plants being large. I expected that, and am working with ~ 240 replications in order to compensate. I am planning to use the whole image - the plants are now big enough that they fill the image area.
