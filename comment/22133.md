 I've updated the notes ui with rounded edges.  And made the button of `ask a question` on both wiki and notes a litle bit rounded. I went through the comments and realised and even noticed it in current website that public labs follows small rounded edges.
But I didn't updated blocks with rounded features in wikis as I tried to make it more sharp along with its font.
