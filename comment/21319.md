A word of warning. A number of tests have been developed along this line.  This includes the lowry, bradford, LEAP (latex Elisa for allergenic proteins), and others.  All have had interference problems ( false positives is one common one).  Modifications to the methods come out periodically, which are more or less successfull.  Be aware of possible interferences.

A related field is BSE  and prions, if anyone is intetested.

Good luck.
