Hi Jirka,

This is an interesting tool. I'm not working on any participatory mapping projects at the moment but will try to test the questionnaires later in the year. Are you aware of the Open Forum on Participatory Geographic Information Systems and Technologies [https://dgroups.org/groups/ppgis]? I expect that if you post your note on that forum you will get useful feedback. They have over 2500 members from all around the globe.

All the best, 

Ned
