Just to clarify, the soil sampling kit from Citizen Science Community Resources is available by contacting them or [@jjcreedon](/profile/jjcreedon)	
directly (it is not currently available through the Public Lab store). CSCR can work with the users of their kit get discounted services with the Test America lab. 

Test America isn't the only lab folks can use--  lab tests for soil samples can be had at a reasonably low cost (around $65, depending on the lab) through regional Cooperative Extension offices. The page here has links to a few: https://www.soils.org/discover-soils/soils-in-the-city/soil-contaminants/soil-testing . If you don't know which lab serves your region you can email any of the offices and they'll point you in the right direction.

The Cooperative Extension offices primarily support soil testing for gardening and agriculture, but most do include lead testing in the services they provide. Anyone planning to work with a CE office (or any lab) should contact them first to make sure you're collecting and shipping samples according to the protocol they use.
