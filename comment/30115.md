[@warren](/profile/warren),
Jeff, thank you for the feedback...

I completely agree that an edge to edge interface, 100vw/100vh, would be best for the image processing tool. To this end, I've reconsidered the purpose of the content that currently creates the necessity of a vertical scroll. Ultimately, it is only the Q&A section and the footer. I don't believe either add crucial value to the page. That is, the only purpose of the sandbox page should be to process images, house the tools that make that possible and provide information to this end. It is adequately sufficient to include the Q&A section on the Infragram home page and to provide a link to it. 

I also feel like the Help menu (to be added in modal form) should offer more structured and specific "help," perhaps organized by topic (which might include links to specific Q&As and/or wiki pages). The most significant issue here being that of the current Q&A section is not readily searchable and therefore not efficiently helpful.

> Do you think there could be a steeper learning curve to have 2 different layouts depending on screen size, or do you think the benefits of the vertical layout (which i agree make more sense for step-by-step layout of tools) outweigh the risks?

It's my opinion that the learning curve (of using the tool) correlates only to the availability and placement of the direction/information and will not be affected by differing layouts. Moreover, I feel like the User Interface should be optimally designed for both, desktop and mobile. Each utilizes significantly different space. With desktops being wider, it makes sense to have the toolbars in left/right columns. That type of design, though, significantly decreases the pixel real estate that should be dedicated to the image itself on smaller, portrait-style screens and lends toward a seemingly crowded UI.  Please see the differences below from differing processing tool sites (noting that the photopea image width is adjusted for their ad space):

Of course, we have to consider and weigh what this means for the code. With differing layouts dependent on Bootstrap, we will have repeated code with multiple display properties. I do think that this should be discussed further with the entire team and that either choice, differing or the same layout for mobile and desktop, will work nicely.

Pertaining to [my Bootstrap mockup](https://github.com/stephaniequintana/Infragram-Bootstrap-Mockup/blob/main/README.md),

> i'm also wondering if the horizontally centered buttons on the left sidebar should be full-width, rather than varying in widths. It could make it a little easier to visually scan

I 100% agree. I was more focused/concerned with ensuring that the grid would correctly reflect the differing toolbars on screen resize that I ignored many aspects of the visual design in the bootstrap mockup. I assure you I understand and agree with the importance of such "design obsessiveness" and am currently working towards finalizing a more complete and thorough proposal. 

Thank you, again, for all of your help and feedback during this contribution period. I look forward to your thoughts on my final proposal. I have every intention of remaining a part of this community. I understand that the internship itself does not begin until late May, but also that this is an OpenSource community and would like to offer my assistance and availability wherever you think it may best be utilized.
There are excellent resources I will utilize to this end, but please feel free to reach out directly if you are in any specific need of help.

Thanks to all involved!
