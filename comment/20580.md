Hi [@zixaq](/profile/zixaq) I've done this before using Raspberry pi 2b and the original raspberry pi camera V2. What I've found is this:
1. Some people recommend to update the system using the command "sudo rpi-update" in terminal.
2. Some clone cameras use the line of code of the led for "other purposes" and rpi people says in some forums that can't be solved but as I understand your camera is raspberry pi v1.3 so this shoud not be the problem.
