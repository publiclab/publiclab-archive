Have you all seen the [PhotosynQ](https://www.photosynq.org/) project? It is an LED based device using reflectance to measure leaf chlorophyl. it started as an incubated kit on the PL store called the [MultispeQ](http://publiclab.myshopify.com/products/multispeq-handheld-fluorometer). 

Seems like it could be a relevant project, closer to your use case maybe.
