Chris,
How did you overlay the spectral image on the Excel graph?

There is another way to extract data from  the camera image:
Use a software that I think is variously called "NIH image" and "ImageJ".  With imageJ one can draw a line or rectangle across the spectrum and then ask the software to plot a profile that can then be copied and pasted into Excel.  Using a known spectrum like a CFL you can then do a pixel vs. wavelength calibration.  So, if you don't have access to spectralworkbench you can use this technique.  ImageJ is freeware.
