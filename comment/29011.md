One of the alternate calibration methods, posted on a different thread, was to use photographic filters that were made of didymium.  It sounds like fiction, but they actually exist.  Their spectrum is very similar to the usp standard and can be found attached to many of the filter specs.  If you choose the right filter, it will be very similar to a standard used for instrument calibration.  Not NIST tracable, but you can't have everything.  And the cost is much less.  Some of the online sources have them for under $20.  Choose your poison.  Good luck.
