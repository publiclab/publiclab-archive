We have 4 turbidity sensors up and running thanks to Will's very clear and helpful instructions! Excited to use them for the event tonight.

I do have a couple of small notes about how the sensor interfaces with Google Sheets:

First -- Users should make sure their spreadsheet is open and they have selected the first cell they'd like to display data in before flipping the "on" switch. Otherwise the page might refresh a bunch of times, or type data in a different column than desired.

Second -- The script to grab the time isn't working for me for some reason. When I simply type "_now" in a cell on Sheets, the script does work. But it does not seem to be replacing "_now" with the time when I am grabbing data from the turbidity sensor. Any troubleshooting tips?
There's a video of my issue here: https://www.loom.com/share/5889e88ea5f34425837cac3b0e5dc95c
