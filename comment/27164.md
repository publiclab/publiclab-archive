Hi John! Thanks for your feedback on the guide. You're right- the link we had used for WXtoImg led to a corrupted download. We have amended the WXtoImg link so that it now leads to the WXtoImg beta download page, from which [@sophied](/profile/sophied), myself and another first-user of the guide Zack Wettstein have successfully downloaded the software. Thanks for catching that! And do let us know how it goes when your hardware arrives.
