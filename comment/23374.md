> Is this what you wanted to say regarding changing notes bg to white and keeping wikis grey as default ?

Yep!

Wow, i like this a lot. 

I have been thinking about how we might make the "metadata" of the notes (like authors, date, likes) even smaller, since it's pretty busy there. We could go as many FontAwesome icons as we could, reducing the amount of text... and what about the date; could we make that more compact too? Maybe if you hover over the date, it shows the full date?

For the wiki pages, is it possible to add a button or something to make the whole main image appear and not be covered up? It might have some important information on it, you know?

What can we reduce or tuck away on wiki pages? Could we also remove text for icons, and what if we removed the `View` tab, but kept some of the other tabs? 

We could put the "revisions" tab in a popover under the "Edited _____ ago" the way it works on GitHub comments, maybe?
