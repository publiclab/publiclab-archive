[@stef](/profile/stef) Thanks for trying out my plans. I also found that the slit width that was printed was sub-optimal. I made a narrower slit with aluminum duct tape (the kind used for HVAC). I'm sorry about the cuvette hole size - I had increased it, but that depends on two factors (the exact size of your cuvette and the printing bead-width of the model of 3-D printer. For my modified slit, I can get a spectral resolution of ~5nm FWHM. 

Did the camera not get as warm when you turn off the auto-focus? For the solar spectrum that you captured, is this a sky spectrum or looking at the sun? Also, there seems to be light in the UV (according to the spectrum scale) - I would assume that that is straylight, but I guess that the calibration may not be valid in that range?

Again, thanks for trying out my plans!
