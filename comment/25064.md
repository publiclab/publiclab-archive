Yes, any gas will be less dense when it is hotter and therefore will have more lift. If the gas inside the balloon is the same as the gas outside (e.g., a hot air balloon) then the gas inside must be hotter (less dense) than the gas outside. Helium is much less dense than air, so helium in a balloon can be cooler than the air outside and still have lift. The helium in the balloon does not have much thermal mass so it would warm up quickly. So the temperature difference between February and July probably cannot explain your lack of lift.

Are your balloons pumped full of helium (plump) or just partly filled? If they were partly filled (both in July and February) then differences in the amount of helium (the volume of the balloons) could explain the difference between now and then.

If the balloons were pumped to plumpness in both February and July, then the difference in lift could be caused by a difference in helium. Did you use pure helium or helium from a party store? Party store helium is not guaranteed to be pure helium. 

If the balloons, payload, gas, and balloon volume were identical between February and July, you have an interesting mystery.
