The swallow line is an interesting idea.  it might work with a huge crowd of kites, but I'm skeptical.  I've seen crowds of fighter kites on similar lines too.

I think the issue is you're using two kites which want to fly at different line angles to each other.  The DC would probably do better with another DC or a kite which wants to fly at the same line angle.  by "fall" you mean it is going backwards from where the Little Bear is and then flipping?

I've seen the same behavior the one time I tried to put a slit in my 6' delta and fly it below my 9' delta.  I haven't gotten back to that experiment.  Paul's Fishing kites has this sort of half kite they put below their main delta for extra pull and lift.  I don't think it would be super hard to make:
