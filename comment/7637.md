Nathan, Would this procedure require a database of known spectra which included the relative (or absolute) strength of each emission peak or just the wavelength of each peak? I don't think anyone has calibrated a Public Lab spectrometer so that peak height can be compared in a very meaningful way. (The problem is that the cameras record data in three color channels which vary in sensitivity across their wavelength range and also overlap with each other.) If only the wavelength of each peak is required, this approach could be tested with fluorescent bulbs which have clear emission peaks from three elements (mercury, terbium, europium) with well known peaks in the visible and near IR range. Good databases of emission peaks exist, but it might be easier to make a test database by scraping the data associated with this image: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fluorescent_lighting_spectrum_peaks_labelled.svg
