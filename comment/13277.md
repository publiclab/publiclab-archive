Very cool.

If you're going to try to make a cuvette frame, another line of thought is the minimal version, which tucks into the DSK housing itself for "rigidity" [sarcastic quotation marks intentional, but only half kidding, as it does lock it in to some extent).

Anyway, here are some photos of a quick little version I mocked up then almost recycled on accident. It's more tape than craft, but it would be light tight and reusable with a simple lid.

Here are some images, shoudl speak for themselves:

this is just a tube formed to the cuvette, then pinched at the bottom to set a depth to it for demo purposes. Window cut out of front and side to allow light to come in, then fluoresce out.

shoves in from the top.

from inside the DSK

whole think took 5 mins to build. Also, the whole thing fits assembled inside our new DSK box. 
this may all be off topic, but hopefully cool to someone
