I was thinking that in order for users to identify an unknown substance, it would be necessary for differing intensities to be compared across spectrometers.  I guess we could use a mathematical work around though.  The mathematical relationship between peaks will be the same for each substance.  I guess in our reference database that we hope to build, we also need to calculate the intensity of each peak at each wavelength.  If we have data for what the peak heights are relative to each other, then we can ID substances.
