Hi [@barun1024](/profile/barun1024) I wanted to share my feedback here as well!

> Barun had one of those projects which can keep growing and growing because there is kind of an “open field” of improvements to make. In retrospect, we might have needed to open more slots for additional students to work in this space. However, Barun did very well in understanding the broad scope of work, and selecting specific areas where discrete progress could be made, rather than picking tons of tiny tweaks that scattered throughout the system. Good prioritization here meant that Barun’s work has resulted really concrete improvements to the system, despite the very high complexity of integration across 3+ different libraries with complex dependencies. Thanks for a great summer!

Much appreciation for your meme-filled final report as well. I echo the reactions!!!!!! 😂
