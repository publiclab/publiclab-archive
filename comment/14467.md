Looks like good confirmation of what I observed -- although the clipping does distort the data. Yes, the noise at sample rate is not AGC (that loop bandwidth would be a much lower frequency) so I'd agree is it just noise, mostly Gaussian and largely independent per pixel -- it's just a webcam, not a sensor for an expensive DSLR.

The difficulty with measuring sharp spectral peaks (using 640pix webcams) is that they are operating close to 1pix/nm resolution and the source's true spike bandwidth is much more narrow. This results in the spectrometer's 2-3nm effective bandwidth 'spreading' the narrow source signal some and asking only 1 pixel to define the peak. This is why time-averaging independent pixels helps -- though it cannot add more points. In theory, given a totally stable system and given sufficient number of samples over time, sub-pixel interpolation could be calculated, but that approach wouldn't work across the variety of hardware and configurations. This is also why the PLab 3 paper and Velcro design was so bad -- the mechanical noise of the grating-camera position variation directly contributes to what you term as "sideways wiggle'. Stabilizing those mechanics, at least reduces the error more to just the degree of alignment between the signal peak (optical) and the camera pixel array.
