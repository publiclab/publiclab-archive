Hi, Ujitha - thanks, I just wanted to hear specifics on the different options. It sounds like Sunspot is a great option. A couple additional question are:

* how will testing work with an external service? 
* will this complicate initial install for new users, or do we assume they won't need to mess with the search service? Is there any simpler fallback that could be used? Just wondering, not essential
