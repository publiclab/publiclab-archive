Oh, toilet tank analogy is great!  [@cversek](/profile/cversek) was talking at LEAFFEST about how, in the water <--> electricity analogy, the only sticking point is capacitance.  He was suggesting the idea of a rubber bladder.  Toilet tank is great, too.

I feel that there's a manifesto be written around 'legible data formats' (like audio frequencies that track a value, rather than encoding a value in some non-intuitive way) akin to the motivations given for the [literate programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) idea.  In the same way that incredible advances in storage capacity and processing power have made the addition of explanatory text to source code a no-brainer now (the compiler can quickly process the file to extract the source code; storage of additional text is not a problem -- but back in the day, constraints of storage and processor speed would make this impossible) -- cf RStudio, Mathematica Notebooks, iPython, the [Jupyter Project], and the community around coffeescript -- we can argue that if storage space is cheap, storing data as audio is not just robust (infrastructure for capturing and interpreting audio ubiquitous) and high-resolution (audio sampling high-res ADC tech is high-quality, cheap, ubiquitous), but means that the data can be easily interpreted, 'sanity checked', and understood across divides of technical background / education / sightedness, etc.  We should even put together a short animated video or something.  "The Science of Echomimetics" -- 1970s science education style.  Inspiration:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4CRCJUmWsM
