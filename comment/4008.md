Looking back through the history to catch up while anxiously waiting to get my kit I see you have come across the Fabry-Perot interferometer effect caused by the reflections between the array and the cover glass. In the Ocean Optics spectrometers we had them remove the cover glass from the Sharp fax machine arrays they used and replace them with AR glass, but the black body curve still showed the waves I see in the sky plots some users have posted.

The only way to eliminate the effect is to show the spectrometer an approximate black body source with known spectral radiance characteristics and apply a correction to all subsequent images. The tungsten lamp calibration technique I suggested previously would help but I have no idea how much. If you show it a tungsten lamp and tell it what we know about the tungsten emissivity characteristics it will most likely be better than it is, and anyone can do it for the cost of a light bulb.
