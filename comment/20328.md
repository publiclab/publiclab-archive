Reporting in input from [@liz](/profile/liz) -- When subscribing, people may often want to get only one email per day or per week, rather than the "firehose" of everything as it comes. So let's come up with a way to easily switch digests on at the moment of subscribing. Two ideas:

1. when you are redirected to htttps://publiclab.org/subscriptions, show a notice saying `you'll get approximately X emails per week. Click here to get only one per day, per week, or per month.`
2. have a checkbox when you click `Subscribe [ ]` so people can say "weekly digest" (or some other period -- see screenshot below)

Other ideas welcome!
