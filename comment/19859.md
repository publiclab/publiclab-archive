I'm really puzzled as to where you are getting CDs and DVDs you can split. As far as I know all commercial pressed CDs are single layer and so are DVDs. The clear polycarbonate is moulded into a disk with the pits and lands that represent the information. It is vacuum flashed with a reflective aluminium layer and then spin coated with a clear lacquer. One single disk of moulded plastic with two coatings - nothing to split. And my article on preparing the diffraction grating specifically says DVD-R in the title and throughout. I just don't see the ambiguity.
