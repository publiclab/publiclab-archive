**Problem [#1](/n/1) : Architecture Problem** 

Currently the code has a lot of redundant code  , Most of the layers have the same code in their JS files .
When we add new layer , we are using the same code again with minor changes in the code like changing sourceURL , markersURL and the API_parsing function .
Although the architecture is good as of now , but it is not scalable and maintainable . 


**Solution [#1](/n/1) : Using One-for-All Architecture**
 
Let’s make a generic common module which would be fully tested having all the functions implemented to add new layer .
This module will be very flexible and existing layers like : 
Mapknitter Layer
SkyTruth Layer
Fractracker Layer 
PurpleLayer Layer
Toxic Layer 
will be implemented by : 

The architecture would be similar to that of PL.Editor where we have a generic module and all other modules are implementing that module .
Also the new architecture will make sure that any new contributor while working on new layer will have to work on one single file only and not take care of the entire system .
 —> Advantage : 
	1.) Maintainable 
	2.) Easy to review new layers 
	3.) Easily Testable 
	4.) Less lines of code 

------------------------

**Problem [#2](/n/2) : Personal User-defined Layer** 

Although we have many amazing dynamic layers implemented , but their API URL is fixed . 
Many people on Stackoverflow and Github have asked how to add custom layers . Currently there is no library which allows users to add their own custom layer . 

**Solution [#2](/n/2) : Add Custom Layer module**
 
We have already implemented similar feature in LBLD to add custom API with custom parsing function . 

------------------------

**Problem [#3](/n/3) : Lack of Contributors**
 
Currently there are a very few people working on LEL . 

**Solution [#3](/n/3) : Let’s build a community !**



I feel LEL has the potential to welcome many new first-time contributors .
Let's make the documentation of how to add a new layer so easy and well structured that a new contributor can start work immediately . 
I will be working on making new well-defined first-timer-only issues during the course of the summer , describing each step of the process concisely . 
Also let’s complete this checklist on Github : 

------------------------

**Problem [#4](/n/4) : Segregate UI code**
 
Currently all the UI code is in the index.html . 
Also we have not provided any provision to add Layers button on the map in the library . 
To add the Layers button , one needs to understand additional code . 

**Solution [#4](/n/4) : Build UI module**
 
Let’s make a provision in the library to automatically give the end user the layers button . 
I will implement a UI module for this purpose with function : 

------------------------

**Problem [#5](/n/5) : Testing**
 
We do not have any tests yet . I will be focussing majorly on testing the generic module first and then UI module part .
Then moving on to testing individual layers . 
Also after implementations of this new tests , we can request first-timer contributors to write tests as well when they implement new layer module .
