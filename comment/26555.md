OK, whew, big pile of feedback [@emash](/profile/emash) and I just went through with [@liz](/profile/liz) -- sorry for the length but I hope this is valuable input to help guide your proposal revisions! We've collected up a bunch of info on the broad goals of this project, AND specifics on the most critical portions we'd like to prioritize at the start of the project timeline, namely UI work on the /spam page and features for moderation team growth. We're happy to answer questions on this but we incorporated ideas and feedback on your proposal and I hope this is helpful!!!

Project description and purpose:  

1. "A central & comfortable place for moderators to deal with spam"
  1. Current/prior approach: different places based on preference -- 
    1. At /spam (ish: didn't have a place to review incoming possible spam until recently)
    2. In-situ as you see spam - (as opposed to, "Now I want to do spam moderation")
    3. In response to email notifications (now much more limited, only after 24 hours have gone by) 
      1. Cons: lots of email, inability to be up to date (only from time sent), unreliable
      2. Pros: on-demand as spam occurs, fits into some peoples' workflows
      3. Note on multimodal moderation systems: have been discussions of chat-based moderation, browser notification based moderation... but none very popular.
2. What is the purpose of doing spam moderation?
  1. Maintain integrity of PL.org content
  2. No inappropriate content
  3. No off-topic or low-value commercial activity
  4. Guidelines at [https://publiclab.org/moderation](https://publiclab.org/moderation)
3. Need spam moderation to not be a burden
  1. Then we can do outreach to grow the moderation team
  2. Should spam be hidden, or visible so as to recruit moderators
    1. We probably started with visible but became hidden as spam became abusive
    2. Once we "have a good system" we can do better outreach to grow the team
4. What is the buy-in of a volunteer to become a moderator
  1. Create opportunities for stewardship - minimize actions you need to take to participate - lower barriers  
  

Goals:  

1. Discussion: improve primary UI of /spam and tabs
  1. Reverse chronological sort of as-yet-unsorted posts - "fall through cracks" when an item isn't clearly spam or not, and drops off the front page of /spam results
  2. Pagination
  3. Basic functionality of tabs like Wiki, Revisions, Comments, Active Users
    1. Improved sorting for these as well
  4. and UI system tests
2. Grow moderation team with responsibility-sharing features: tag-filtered moderation, digests
  1. Ability to be a moderator for only some topics of content: only get comment, post notifications for these tags, although still ABLE to moderate site-wide.
    1. topic/tag based filtering can be done via profile tags, just like digest/notifications preferences (see https://publiclab.org/settings)
  2. Digests - provide multimodal interfaces 
    1. +1 digests to remind people to come moderate spam
    2. +1 ability to set frequency daily/weekly/monthly?
    3. digests should be possible for tag-filtered moderation activity
    4. Goal: meet people offsite, reminds them to come to us. Polite: provides flexibility & freedom.
3. Education features:
  1. "Invites" from educators to bypass moderation (has an issue somewhere)
    1. The invite could be to make an account OR to leave a response (nice bc it achieves 2 things in one step)
  2. "Follow" buttons next to peoples' comments/responses/usernames on your own posts

Thank you so much for your proposal!
