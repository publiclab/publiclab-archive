Chris,

What you describe is part of what I'm trying to do. I want to take your description one step further so that the “new value” represents a physical measurement – reflectance. I expect that the basic function will be the same for each color but the coefficients will be different since, for example, white balance will effect each channel (color) differently. 

Well said. A lot of what I'm trying to do is to better understand the processing going on in the camera. The gamma correction process seems to be well documented but I'm still not sure if white balance does more than multiplies pixel values in a particular channel values by a constant or if it's more complicated than that. The only other processing that I am aware of is a scaling between the gamma corrected RAW pixel values and the JPEG values and some lossy compression but maybe there is more going on.
