I've lifted lids before.  In that case, which happened in a world without lawyers, I used 

gloves
a flatbar and a crowbar (or a "prop" wrench, hammer, etc,something to work with the flatbar)
a friend with gloves

I used the flatbar to pry the lid up from the middle side (some of them have slots)
the wrench to prop it up above finger height

one person to bravely place fingers in and lift slightly
second person to place fingers in and take the weight
first person is now a spotter
second or third or a few persons lifts from the knees 
               to get lid to 90 degree position, balanced. 

many gloved hands to lift safely to the open position
drop heavy heavy iron cover onto the grass
       while all persons step back to avoid foot injury

of course, this never happened.
