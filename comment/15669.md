Hi, Patrick - I'm not sure what you, [@liz](/profile/liz), and [@donblair](/profile/donblair) are up to on this, but I was adding some helpful tags so many projects show up with listed activities and upgrades on https://publiclab.org/tools -- and saw all the riffle-related posts over the past months. I tagged a variety of them with `activity:riffle` and they now show up on the /tools page. 

Just a thought -- on that page, i wonder if a lead image like this one would display better:

[![riffle](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/016/219/medium/riffle_20160517-5550-2.jpg)](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/016/219/original/riffle_20160517-5550-2.jpg)
