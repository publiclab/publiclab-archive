Setting up and running an integrating sphere is within your reach for a 12 week course as long as the equipment is working and you have access to someone who can get you up and running. There are a number of old  integrating spheres that were used for a projects years ago and are now stored in closets in many organizations. Using the integrating sphere isn't all that difficult. It takes time and carefully following calibration and measurement protocols.
