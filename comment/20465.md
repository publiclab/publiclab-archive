Sources / links. It all feels a bit insufficiently conclusive to me.

Store-Bought Lead Tests: Are They Worth It? Analysis of the top three home-testing kits at Home Depot. (They're mostly frowned upon and paint a negative picture). --> https://mytapscore.com/blogs/tips-for-taps/store-bought-lead-tests-are-they-worth-it

"Marc Edwards is a professor at Virginia Tech who has tested water for lead in D.C. and Flint, Michigan. He is not a big fan of the home testing kits. If they are positive, he said, you can trust that result. But if it's negative, you still don't know for sure." --> https://wjla.com/features/7-on-your-side/testing-for-lead-in-your-water-are-home-tests-reliable

Customer Reports, in this "how to test for lead" post, noticeably doesn't explicit mention these strips, but does seem to suggest that they might be useful (maybe). Pretty unclear... They do link to the strips via the Buy on Amazon link at the bottom so maybe that means they're cool with them in at least certain situations? --> https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/lead-test-kits/buying-guide/index.htm

These kits sold on amazon have mixed reviews, for what that's worth.
