I'd also like to highlight the issue of the webcam USB cable pushing the camera -- we need a better way to manage the cable and have since the 2.0 version.

I'm wondering if we could have a place that the cable threads into a kind of sleeve, and maybe even use an S-bend to really control it and not allow any tugging or anything to affect the mounting. I also agree that tape alone may not be enough. We used to use foam tape which was really solid, in that it was 'space-filling'.
