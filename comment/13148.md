That's an awesome crash test. I think taking advantage of the tripod socket is a really good idea. The little tripod head you use is more than you need, but it should work well (all you need is a plate with a hole or a coat hanger wire with a loop). The leg system looks pretty effective. I would immediately add two more legs. Kites can drop and let the camera hit the ground, but more often a much safer landing can involve the camera being dragged over the ground. You can't predict which way the camera will be dragged, or even whether it will land hard at an odd angle. I have never flown a camera with so little protection, but many people do. It's probably a good idea to give beginners an easy way to surround the camera with protection.
