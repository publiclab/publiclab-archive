Hi [@asmaibrahim657](/profile/asmaibrahim657), I really love the amount of research you've done. I have a question about the Q&A section. I love your redesign of that section but do you think it distracts the user away from Infragram's functionality? Do you think it'd be better if we converted that section to a help menu?

Also, it's better to break each week's task into smaller pieces so that it's more manageable. Thanks!!
