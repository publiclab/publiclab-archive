I've tried using a small keychain camera for KAP and I basically just used a miniature version of the standard PET Bottle Rig- http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/06-25-2014/kap-test-for-invasives-monitoring-project
  However, I've got to say the difference in weight affects the stability of the rig considerably.  I'd be very interested in getting input from others using small cams like the Mobius on my new research note- http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/07-09-2014/kap-rig-for-mobius-action-cam
