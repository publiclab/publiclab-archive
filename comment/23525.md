 hello,i am trying to search notes for a 3d printed spectrometer which i saw some time ago i have been offline for sometime due to health issues and was unable to be more active "I think that@Warren has published several so is there a searchable index of research notes if so where does it live?
any help is greatly appreciated,
thanks and Regards,
Stef
