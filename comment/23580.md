 Hello [@jywarren](/profile/jywarren), [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano) , [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) , [@icarito](/profile/icarito) and all the members of the community. Please review my proposal for Spectral Workbench Capture for GSoC 2019. 

I have tried to cover everything in the proposal except the implementation part and the timeline of the period in which I will be working on testing and consolidating the API since I have some doubts which I have to get confirmed from [@jywarren](/profile/jywarren). I will be posting them too as soon as possible.

I really like the welcoming nature of the Public Lab community and want to work with it for more time and learn as much as I can. Alongwith these, I would try to give back to the community as much as I can by Outreaching. 

Thanks ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ˜ƒ
