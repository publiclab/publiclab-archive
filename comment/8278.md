Grayson,  
The NDVI images look excellent.
Just to clarify a few things, I think the following are true:

1. The NIR camera has had its IR block filter removed.
2. The 850 nm and 720 nm filters are glass filters in front of the lens of the NIR camera. 
3. These are good optical filters which pass no wavelengths shorter than 720 or 850 nm, so pass absolutely no visible light.
3. The histograms are of the entire NIR photos.
4. You used CHDK to capture RAW image data.
5. The color table for the NDVI images is NDVIBlu2Red.lut:

Some questions for you:

1. Which channel did you use for visible light to compute NDVI?
2. Which channel did you use for NIR light to compute NDVI?
3. Did you stretch either or both histograms? How much?
4. Did you use the RAW files? How did you convert them to jpg or tiff?


This is a really revealing test.  I conclude that:

1. The green channel in the A2500 is not very sensitive to NIR light > 720 nm, but does record some. In other words, the Bayer filter over all the green pixels does not pass as much NIR light as the filter over the blue and red pixels.
2. The red Bayer filter passes more NIR light between 720 and 850 nm than does the blue Bayer filter.
3. The red and blue Bayer filters pass the same amount of NIR light longer than 850 nm.
4. The processing of RAW files to tiff requires assumptions about white balance and other things. Your histograms could look quite different with assumptions other than the ones made. So statements 1 to 3 above might not really be true.
5. Your photos include lots of bright sky. If sky was not included, this would increase the dynamic range of the part of the scene with vegetation. Then there might be more information about NDVI differences within the vegetated part of the scene.
6. Considering that you used only part of the camera's dynamic range for the vegetated part of the photos, there is a lot of good plant heath information in the NDVI images.
7. I agree that the 850 nm filter NDVI images has slightly increased NDVI values (shifted to the right on the scale). That could be an artifact of several processing steps.
8. It would be good to see histograms of just a homogeneous area of vegetation. That might be easier to interpret.
8. This is very cool.
