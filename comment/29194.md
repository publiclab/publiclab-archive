Thanks for sharing and making this point. Do you know if the location you sampled was part of a separate storm sewer or combined storm sewer system? Combined systems can permit overflows when the system would otherwise be overloaded, unfortunately. And apparently, even in separate systems, it's possible that sanitary sewer overflows are allowed under the NPDES permit.
