Hi, Dave - try reloading the page - i briefly edited the spectrum while chasing a bug, so you may have seen it in the wrong state -- tell me what you think. 

You're right that we don't want to mix this up with boosting signal to noise -- we're just cutting out baseline noise. I'm changing the title slightly to be consistent with the set title -- 'removing baseline noise' -- not just removing noise.
