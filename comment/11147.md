I'd really like a stand alone version so I can store, organise and delete captured data and take measurements without an internet connection.
If at all possible some method of built in camera control. I know there were support problems with this, but I use camera control all the time and switching ownership of the camera backwards and forwards between the browser and the camera control program is a bit cumbersome.
