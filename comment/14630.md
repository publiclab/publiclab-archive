Hi donblair, thanks. There is still a bit of development to be done, especially for extended deployments, but I think the design shows promise. 

I used a 5 kHz square wave for the data and calibration in this research note. I came to use this frequency mostly arbitrarily (I have seen instruments use frequencies anywhere from 1 kHz to 10 kHz). I have not seen any good resources that evaluate the effectiveness of different frequencies for conductivity measurements, and would be interested if you know of any. Its easy enough (one line of code) to change the frequency, and I may play around with it a bit more. 

For the applied voltage, I'm using +-1.65 V across the cell. Since there is not reference electrode, and if you assume that water is the first redox active species in the solution, then I believe you have ~1.2 V plus the overpotential of the electrode (~0.6 V for graphite) before you start oxidizing or reducing water. If you do have other redox active species in solution I can see the advantage of keeping the voltage as low as possible. I'll have to test that out also for the next generation of the circuit board.
