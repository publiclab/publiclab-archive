The second reference (43) on this paper describing how to calibrate the cameras is "Recovering device sensitivities with quadratic programming." Graham D. Finlayson, Steven Hordley Paul M. Hubel  [Full text here.](http://www.inventoland.net/imaging/JEI/090.PDF)

to quote:
Our approach requires only, that we can record the response of
the device to a number of objects of known surface re-
flectance (for example a Macbeth Color Checker Chart)
under known illumination conditions.
As we will show, the responses of a device (typically a
set of RGB values) are linearly related to the spectral sur-
face reflectance data, and furthermore this relationship is
defined by the sensor response functions. It follows that
we should be able to solve for the sensors by a simple lin-
ear regression. However a a regression of this kind leads to
very poor estimates of the sensors. This poor performance
is due to the limited dimensionality of surface reflectance
functions, which leads to sensor estimates which are highly
sensitive to noise in the device responses. To overcome this
problem we incorporate into the problem formulation a
number of natural constraints; sensitivity functions should
be positive, have limited modality, and be band-limited.
We then solve for the sensor functions by a constrained
regression. The fact that all the constraints are linear al-
lows us to pose the regression in a quadratic programming
form
