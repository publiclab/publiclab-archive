Despite my zeal for the project, I have tried not to bomb everyone here with the many incremental updates as I go along. But I think I might have produced something that could really help people doing citizen science. Basically its cheap DIY datalogger that most could assemble out of 3 components, for about $10-15. Add another tenner and you have an waterproof housing for it as well.

Anyway, I hope that this helps someone out there who's project needs cheap data-loggers that can be assembled from "off-the-shelf" parts. As I mention in the post, these units will probably run for at least 3-four months on 6 AA batteries.
