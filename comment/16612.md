[@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) [@warren](/profile/warren) [@kkoerner](/profile/kkoerner) Interesting to think about the container's involvement with vibrations as well, especially since I was thinking of having a container within a container to hide the pump. Sounds like another thing to test. Happy to work with a designer in Paris, too. Let's just build the kit there. :D
