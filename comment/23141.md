Tried building CamHolderApp from source, but had to download QTKit later, found that QuickTime has been removed from Xcode, etc.

Finally found a binary app:
http://camholder.org/download/CamHolderApp.zip

Downloaded it, starts fine. Will try later tonight to connect to the camera and see if I can change the settings.
I don't have the camera with me now.


This is the screenshot of CamHolderApp:
