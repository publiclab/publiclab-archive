Ha - [@dhaffnersr](/profile/dhaffnersr), sorry, I think you found a bug in the "Post related work" button -- it seems it copies even the "barnstar" tag from the older post. You can delete it by removing the tag `barnstar:empiricism`. Sorry, and if you'd file a bug (see footer for details) that'd be helpful! Thanks.
