Abdul,  
You are correct that all of the things you list could be responsible for the failure to produce a meaningful NDVI image. It could also be due to the color of the ambient light being strange, or the custom white balance being wrong for that lens. Without some controlled tests it will be difficult to determine what is to blame. 

The photo from the camera is not blue enough to be directly converted to NDVI (i.e., with the standard formula). The blue channel, which is used for NIR, is not much brighter than the red channel in pixels capturing green leaves. If you alter the photo by making it bluer, stretch both histograms, and then increase the value in all the pixels of the NDVI image by 15, you get this:

Making photos which can be converted directly to a facsimile of NDVI requires a custom white balance appropriate for the lens, the sensor, and the ambient light. It also requires a properly exposed photo. Satisfying all of these requirements for each photo taken of plants is probably not possible if the same white balance and automatic exposure are used for all photos regardless of ambient light.
