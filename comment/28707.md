Hello Jeremiah, thank you for reporting the issue to us. Sorry you are having problems. We are investigating the issue and will try to implement a solution or suggest a workaround. In the meantime I've opened a new issue detailing the errors in the log so that we can work openly figuring out what it is about: https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/1517
Thanks for your understanding and collaboration in helping us improve Mapknitter!
