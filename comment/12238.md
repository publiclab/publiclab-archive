I'm very interested to hear how your setups work as they are very similar to mine.  As I mentioned on one of your earlier notes, I posted some detailed reviews on my note here- http://publiclab.org/notes/ajawitz/06-07-2015/2015-kap-mapping-season-in-midcoast-maine.
  However, since the note was published I did receive my Prism Bora Parafoil Kite so perhaps I'll have to give it a try soon!  
   IMHO, my best kite is the French Military Kite from Gomberg but I did notice that Prism makes [their own variation of the FMK](http://www.prismkites.com/products-sl-isotope.php).
  While I find Prism's aesthetic kind of creepy (in an early 90's extreme sports kind of way), I have been very impressed with the overall quality of the materials.  

  Also, I was in a fancy toy store in Ogunquiit Maine the other day and noticed they had a whole selection of Prism and ITW kites.  I was especially intrigued by the little"pocket foils" that come in a little pouch.  It would be awesome if they could actually lift a Mobius!
