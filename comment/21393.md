Hi, 
Your asking good questions….  [@CD3000](/profile/CD3000)

-Is the purpose of two LEDs to have one for transmission (below sample) and another for reflection(above sample)?
--Both the 850nm and 940 LEDs were used in the reflection mode.   Two different LED wavelengths were used primarily to see which would produce ‘better pictures’ or provide greater contrast.   Bug 2 and 3 pictures posted above show that that the different wavelengths highlight different insect features.
--Suppose you could also work in transmission mode as well.  Depends on how thick the insect is? 

-I was thinking of using these 5mm LED from LED supply (850nm & 940nm) on a credit card substrate with copper tape and button cell. https://www.ledsupply.com/leds/5mm-led-infrared-850nm-50-degree-viewing-angle
--LED model should work fine but have no experience with credit card substrate.  My set up was:  LED, wires, resistor, on/off switch connected to 9V battery.    One issue is how to adjust LED for best picture.   This typically means some type of holder to vary angle/distance to image.

-Could you recommend resistor pot for dimmer control, or should I use their 20mA DynaOhm?
--I assume it should work but all my LEDs used fixed resistance.    At the time, I always wanted max power to see if the IR light could make it through  different layers of the insect. 
     
-I am wondering what's the best configuration to allow ease of exchange between wavelengths,
--One set up I used involved  the Raspberry PI to sequence the different LEDs as well as control the different camera settings.   Check out other MaggPI Public Lab posts such https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/03-15-2018/computer-vision-led-plant-measurement-system

-I am wondering what's the best configuration to allow ease of exchange between wavelengths, as I was also considering using 365m, and 400nm wavelength LED.

--LED multispectral imaging can be very rewarding but also demanding.  As an example, see the picture below of a basil leaf illuminated by different wavelength LEDs and observed with a Raspberry Pi camera.  Note that UV1 and UV2  images (while different than WHT light image) look the same even though illuminated  with two different wavelength LEDs.   Believe this is due to the way the Pi color camera/lens interprets/filters the UV light.  You may want also want to check out the UV TAGs  on the Public Lab   site (but most seem focused on UV spectroscopy vs UV imaging).

Top left is a computer vision enhanced image. Top right is white light image. Images below are for ultraviolet (uv1)(375-385nm), ultraviolet (uv2) (385-395nm), blue(blu), green (grn), red and infrared (ir)(850nm) LEDs. Remaining images are processed images that highlight color contrast.



---Not exactly sure what your application is but if your working IR /UV insect imaging there are countless things to try out. Some high contrast options are non-colorless circulatory systems such as  insects with  yellow or green ‘blood’ and compound insect eyes with  the well known  UV sparkle effect, etc…
