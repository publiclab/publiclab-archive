what about those [soft silicone phone cases?](http://www.amazon.com/igadgitz-Silicone-Smartphone-Protector-Compatible/dp/B0089CH1G2/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1344973737&sr=8-9&keywords=silicone+galaxy+s3+case) They're cheap and I bet that the attachment plate could flange underneath a hole in one of those, so long as the flange extended in all directions (currently it just goes down.)
