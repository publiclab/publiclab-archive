Hey guys- I'm new here and apologize if this has already been stated. If you want to see the maximum fluorescence, you must first look at its absorption spectra to determine the wavelength of maximum absorption. If your camera doesn't detect UV light, remove all filters in the camera lens assy that are blocking/ absorbing UV/ IR light so that the absorption reading will cover the widest range. There are LED's available for most any wavelength.
