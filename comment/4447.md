Both timelapse programs allow selection of any available resolution including 1600x1200.  The image quality I was getting from the lens did not seem to be able to exploit any more pixels than 640x480, so I chose that. I am doing more tests to maximize sharpness at a subject distance of about 15 inches for a plant timelapse, and I will compare 1600x1200 with 640x480 to see if it makes any difference.
