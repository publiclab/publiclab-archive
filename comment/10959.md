Here - I started mapping out my old hometown & its waterways:
mapknitter.org/map/view/cromernorfolkuk

You should be able to see for yourself - there is a lot of erosion along the eastern cliffs.
Where the big patch of green is is where the cliffs have fallen away and trees/foliage has bloomed in the waterlogged cliff-face.
