Excellent precision in the values for both the public lab and DOH method--so there was clearly very diligent field work!

I did a quick search for other absorption tube reports and found an old journal article about Drager tubes (a competing brand), which were reported to be 89% to 160% higher than the known concentration in laboratory conditions.  See Balmat, J. L. "Accuracy of Formaldehyde Analysis Using the Draeger Tube," Am. Ind. Hyg. Assoc. J. 47:512-513 (1986), summary only: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15298668691390133
