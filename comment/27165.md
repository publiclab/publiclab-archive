I managed to find an RTL-SRD in the UK so I am set up and running. Everything working very well. I have my home made QFH on a 10ft pole in the middle of the garden. There must be at least 10m of RG213 from it to my MacBook indoors but I still get good results.

Virtually as good as I used to get with a dedicated WXsat receiver and a pre-amp many years ago. Back then the main problem was interference from pager transmitters on nearby frequencies. Thankfully they have disappeared from the  airwaves. 

Many thanks again for putting together this superb 'getting started' guide. I have written about my set up on my blog with a link back to here. Hope more people rise to the challenge.
