Actually SW used to smooth at capture time. The other way to do it is not time-smoothing, but averaging in data from the extra dimension in each frame -- but probably time smoothing is easier in SW, since it asks you first to choose a row, and records data over time.

(an hour later) ...OK, I published a macro adding smoothing using the API: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-19-2013/smoothing-macro-using-spectral-workbench-api
