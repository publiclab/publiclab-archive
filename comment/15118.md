I'm thinking about how we might add some hints for how to most easily do browser-to-browser over a cable. Just an idea -- what if we used these two cables -- if we have devices A and B, and we connected A-Left to B-Video and A-Video to B-Left, would that create a simple crossover cable with no need for wire strippers or soldering?

Also, for folks looking to use/make crossover cables, here are some cheap headset socket boards that could be used: (5-pack for $4.39)
