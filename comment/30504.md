 A carnivore is an animal that feeds. 
The four spheres are 
 Hydrosphere 
Atmosphere 
Geosphere 
 Biosphere 

An omnivore is an animal or human that eats both plants and organs. 
Burmese pythons can survive in regions of southern United States. It thrives in warmer temperatures and has invaded Florida, replacing alligators and crocodiles
 Three biotic series: 
consumers  
producers 
Decomposers  
 Biome- a large community that is occupying ng a major habitat 
The regions that are in the south gives good pythons a good chance to thrive.  
It is extremely dangerous because the python in the south is likely to kill our resources or be ready to hurt or harm us.
