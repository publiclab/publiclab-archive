I guess I demonstrated that the u-blox is protected someway or another from voltage over the stated 3.6v max. I was using four eneloop AAA (4 x 1.2v = 4.8v) which were maybe about half discharged (therefore, < 4.8v), and the Nano voltage regulator tried to make 5v with that. I don't know what the actual voltage was on the "5v" pin. 

I have found that when running the u-blox from the 3V3 (3.3v) pin on the Nano, the Nano cannot be programmed via USB when the u-blox antenna is plugged in. The Arduino IDE cannot communicate with the Nano. If I unplug the antenna or if I supply battery power to the Nano, the communication via USB is normal. When the u-blox was (mistakenly) powered by the 5v pin on the Nano, USB communication was normal with the antenna connected. So the u-blox seems to work better on the 5v pin than on the 3V3 pin. The 3V3 pin does not seem to supply enough juice to keep everything happy when the antenna is powered up. But maybe that's because I fried something running the u-blox on 5v.

Gotta love Arduino.
