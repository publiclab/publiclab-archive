Well, a common way to do hyperspectral is to just collect a whole row of spectra (y dimension is your row of pixels, x dimension is wavelength) and then collect a stack of them for each column of light from the real world -- or more conveniently, a video of slowly moving past the scene. 

In airplanes and satellites, the time dimension is usually just the motion of the camera itself across the landscape. To make my apple photo, I dragged it slowly across the frame on a black piece of paper while illuminating it VERY brightly with floodlights.
