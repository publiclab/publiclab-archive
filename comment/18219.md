I heard from Oliver Kellhammer that kombucha leather gets its rich brown color from the tannins in the tea that it grows in. The question about what kind of tea to use is being discussed here: https://publiclab.org/questions/liz/01-19-2018/does-it-matter-what-kind-of-tea-i-use-to-grow-kombucha. i guess i would add to my question then is there any way to bleach out any tannins after it's thickened into a sheet -- either before or after drying?
