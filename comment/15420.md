Thanks [@warren](/profile/warren)! [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1) - this is a great suggestion for improvement as I've also had that happen. How about [@akshaya](/profile/akshaya) and I will make a digikey shopping cart with all the parts and then people can go look at it for reference? (Do those stick around for awhile?)
