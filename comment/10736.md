Id like to use the alternating white/black/white/cyan/green/yellow/red/magenta gradient, Im using GIMP 2, and Im wondering how to do it? Ive just joined this forum, and found it really useful. 

Ive also got 2 mobius cams, one infrablue, the other RGB. Id like more useful color data, i just dont know how to do it.
can you help?

Thank you
Patrick
