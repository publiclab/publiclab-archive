Hi [@warren](/profile/warren) and all,

Sorry I was away for a couple of days and couldn't access the Internet. 

yes indeed, there is a new version available here: https://edieblu.github.io/pl-welcome.io/

I've worked on the copywriting, changed the layout a little bit and added the links.

Let me know what you think.

For the last section, should I just work with the existing text (1. The Problem, 2. The Collaboration, 3. The Solution etc)?

I think the page is coming together nicely :) 

Let me know your thoughts!

Kind regards, 
Eva
