Wow, I didn't know there was a Fastie colormap at Infragram.org. I think it will need a new name (How about VGYR for violet green yellow red?). I guess Jeff ported it to Infragram. The translation must have been done by hand so there were probably translation mismatches. But there might also be processing differences. 

Your output from MATLAB looks excellent. Nice legend.
