Nice work, all. It will be interesting to see the followup results. I was also interested in the details on:
- construction of the HackrBlimp; is that a fill tube, shown at the end? Brief description of materials and assembly would be of general interest. DIY schematics would be neat.
- Helium supply and availability observations, were you able to get it on short notice for your flight, or did you have it cached from before?
- camera(s) connection to HackrBlimp or line and rigging details, e.g., use of the four connection points.
- gps considerations; sounds like it was with Chris on the ground. Was there a constraint that prevented you from flying another gps with the cameras?

Thanks for sharing these nice results.
