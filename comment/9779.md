Nothing rattles when I shake the lens but reassembling the case (or any movement/vibration) alters the focus. I haven't installed a new filter yet. Tightening the set screw doesn't affect the focus if this is done with minimal movement of the lens which says to me that something inside the lens assembly is loose. Tapping the back of the lens housing alters the focus too. This is a very gradual shit so the more you tap, the more out of focus the image becomes. Tapping the lens housing in the opposite direction has the reverse effect.

This bothers me as I've build a quadcopter on which I am planning to use the ir camera. As you guys probably know, as much as you isolate the camera from the quad's vibrations, the camera will still inevitably receive some, thereby causing the focus to shift and rendering it effectively useless. I'd also be interested to hear if anybody has experienced these same issues with the camera even if the ir blocker hasn't been removed.

[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) Thanks for your response as I see you're the one who posted this modification. If you haven't experienced this issue then maybe I've just been unlucky in executing the whole modification but I'm sure you can understand why I'm reluctant to repeat it. Who knows, it may be fine the second time around. What I'd like to see is these lenses manufactured sans ir blocker.

Some pictures of my quad because everybody likes looking at photos!

Thanks again for your responses.
