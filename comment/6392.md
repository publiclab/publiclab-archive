Holy cow. This is a really great idea. They have MODIS NDVI included in their animation! It would be awesome to get a few people to take infrablue photos at the same Picture Post every two weeks or so for a year or more. It would be important to establish a good protocol (camera, filter, settings, white balance, etc) before the first photos so that it stays the same. The actual NDVI values will not match the MODIS NDVI, but the annual cycle could look just the same. Also, comparing among different Picture Posts done with different cameras, etc. will not be that meaningful, but each NDVI Picture Post series could be very revealing. I wish there was a Picture Post near me. Oh, wait, it's just a piece of plywood.
