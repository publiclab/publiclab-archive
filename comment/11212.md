Oh here's a crazy idea. You could point at other `contributor.json` files by reference using a universal identifier, aka UUID. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier

The process of generating a UUID for `contributor.json` for a given project might be something like this:

1. the code is updated.
2. the contributor.json file is updated with any new authors as needed
3. all files in the project at the current time are hashed using e.g. SHA256 and then all the hashes are XORed (this way order does not matter).
4. the time itself, in seconds since epoch, is concatenated onto the SHA256.
5. the remainder of the UUID's bits are randomly generated.
6. the contributor.json is updated to contain the project's current UUID

A new project would have a UUID of all 0s in the contributor file as an initial seed, but step 6 would replace the 0s.

Now your contributor.json file can maintain a series of UUID pointers to the UUID found in each of the upstream's current contributor.json.

In this way, each change could be tracked by a UUID without copying the repository and is highly likely to be a unique fingerprint for that repository at that time. This is a bit of a one-way mapping, unfortunately. Backing out of it would be difficult. It might require caching this information in a repository or something so that a UUID can be mapped to its originating source.
