Sorry I was wrong about your original photo being grayscale. You are correct that it is color photo. All three color channels are extremely similar, so it appears to be a grayscale photo. That photo will not produce good results when converted directly to NDVI. NDVI for healthy foliage is in the range 0.3 to 0.7. To compute a value in that range, the NIR value must be 2 to 8 times greater than the value for red because healthy foliage in sunlight reflects 2 to 8 times more NIR than red. 

see: https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/000/542/original/tuples.JPG

Your photo has about the same value for NIR as for red because your camera is not as sensitive to NIR as it is to red. This is true of all consumer cameras.

It is possible to crudely compensate for this by adjusting the white balance setting on the camera so the brightness of the blue channel (NIR) is exaggerated. This is easy to do on the Mobius camera and many point and shoot cameras.

Adjusting the color balance after the photo is taken should also be possible, but probably only if you capture the raw image data. I have not seen this done successfully.

To repeat, it is not possible to evaluate your NDVI images because you do not include a color key.
