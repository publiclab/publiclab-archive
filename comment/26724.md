Hi Stevie, 
We usually deploy for half an hour. Anything less than that and its not much of a representative sample. That's in relatively steady flowing water without surface smutz like leaves, algae or debris. You should generally avoid water with a lot of gunk in it because it makes processing the sample nearly impossible. We've also left trawls out for much longer-- 10 hours at one point, but that was in slow, even water where we knew the trawl wouldn't tangle or be investigated by ducks or people. I recommend always keeping an eye on the trawl in case it gets tangled. 
Hope that helps. 
Max
