hello Dr. summers,thought I'd pipe in here to express some interest in both the data logger circuitry details as well as your neat GUI. It certainly interests me; I probably could use it for at least a dozen or so things,right off the top of my head! If you could see clear to putting it on either Github or sending it to me, that would be great!
