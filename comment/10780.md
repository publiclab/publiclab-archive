hello Dr. summers,thought I'd pipe in here to express some interest in both the data logger circuitry details as well as your neat GUI. It certainly interests me; I probably could use it for at least a dozen or so things,right off the top of my head! If you could see clear to putting it on either Github or sending it to me, that would be great!

Regards, Mark Rairie
