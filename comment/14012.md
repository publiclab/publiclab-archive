Could it be that in a world where Republican presidential candidates publicly call for abolishing the EPA, that there just isn't the statewide public support needed to properly fund state environmental departments? 

That's how it feels in Maryland. We just elected a Republican governor in our liberal state. He has a 60 % approval rating. And even before him, MDE didn't really have the staffing needed to do their jobs effectively.
