 A red filter used to convert a full spectrum camera (IR cut filter removed) to an NDVI camera must pass red light and NIR light but no blue light. Rosco publishes spectral transmission  graphs of all of its filters, so we know the Rosco [#19](/n/19) meets these specifications. To learn the specifications of an unknown filter some type of spectrometer device is required.

You can also just try it and see if you get reasonable results.
