1) Looking up the flow rate is going to give a rough estimate, but we will probably have to measure in-situ. The bubble method is a good one here. We can also use plastic bags of a specific volume and fill them up, like 1-gallon ziplock bags.

just opening/closing the valve could potentially damage the pump.  The pump also tends to whine in distress when closed off, and so it would be pretty noticeable. I think you'd want a bi-directional control valve that would dump air from the pump before getting to the filter media.  There should be '3-way' or 3-port valves available where they usually empty out an exhaust port but can be powered to send flow in a chosen direction. I don't have an example in front of me, but that should solve the sound issues.
