The 8 states that the Ogallala is located is Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Colorado, South Dakoda, Nebraska, Wyoming, Oklahoma. There is 978 trillion gallons of water underground, but it is being deprived extremely quickly. Ogallala is also known as high plane aquifer. If the Ogallala that is in the ground runs out there wonâ€™t be any water for the farmers to plant and grow food. It will also give the people that live in those states water to drink.
