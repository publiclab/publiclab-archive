I glanced back over the 2019 data, and although "check all that apply" was the format of the question, no respondent checked more than one box; anyone who might have seems to have chosen to check  the box for Multiracial or Multiethnic. I checked the raw results and the graphâ€”all 63 respondents answered, and all 63 rows are represented in the graph. This leads me to assume the sum of 98.5% on the graph is a rounding error.
