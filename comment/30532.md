          Endangered species are those plants and animals that have become so rare they are in danger of becoming extinct. Threatened species are plants and animals that are likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. An endangered species is a type of organism that is threatened by extinction. Many moves into the endangered or vulnerable category if the negative factors affecting them continue to operate.
 
         The black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) is a threatened species on the verge of extinction. While it is thought that the ferret once had an extended range, poisoning of their prey (prairie dogs) and a plague killed off their population. That is all of our fault because we are adding to the world warming up and for every good thing we do we are doing 10 bad things that effect the world. The polar bears are losing resources and they are losing space to leave so they are slowly dying off.
