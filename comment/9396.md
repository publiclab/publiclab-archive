So, the translucent paint would provide a filter and you'd select the paint color to select the spectral wavelength to detect? ...which is similar to using colored plastic filters or food coloring to let "just one color through" ...

I suspect that the acrylic material has a very broad frequency pass-band -- meaning it will not be very wavelength specific -- meaning it will be difficult to detect one 'blue' from another 'blue' strictly by output intensity -- 'red' might be orange, red and infrared. However, experiments are a good way to find out.

If you have a PLab spectrometer, you could do a simple test. Capture a spectrum using white light from a broad-band source like a halogen bulb. Then, insert your acrylic painted material between the light source and the spectrometer and observer the difference. Is the result a nice sharp peak or a broad curve?

Cheers,
