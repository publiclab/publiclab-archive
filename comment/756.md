Actually i think that dual-camera wiki section on shutter priority was Chris F's -- it's a good idea but personally I usually leave it on auto, and have gotten good results with the A495. 

Whenever you fly more than one camera, you multiply the # of things that can go wrong, i guess :-( but it's great for comparing the performance of various cameras.
