I'll defer to Jeff on the technical questions of SVG vs canvas in browser. If we want to support the export of map annotations, SVG is a very nice portable format-- will working with it in browser simplify export?

other notes-- 
A legend feature is a great idea!

constraining annotations within the bounds of placed images would prevent people from annotating without/before collecting map imagery-- and pre-trip planning is one of our big community desires here.  That won't work as a means of controlling system resources.

great writeup!
