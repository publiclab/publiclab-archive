[@maggpi](/profile/maggpi) - great input, thanks!

Some notes on blob detection: https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues/172

Object tracking:

I really like this project, and think it could essentially take an incoming video stream OR series of images, and progressively build up a much larger image from them by tracking objects. 

A pretty cool follow-up or stretch goal could be: have "sharper" pixels (determine by evaluating local contrast) "knock out" blurrier ones. Then you could do focus stacking out of order:

It could also be used to generate maps from balloons/kites/drones, in theory, although the more spherical distortion, the worse it'd work.
