The focal length of the lens depends on your goals, the area you want to cover, the elevation of the drone, how much distortion (fish eye) you can tolerate, desired resolution, ease of stitching photos together, etc. 

I don't know how easy it is to remove the IR cut filter from any particular model of GoPro.

If someone recommended the C3040 for NDVI it might be easy to remove the IR cut filter. Maybe you could try that before doing surgery on a GoPro.
