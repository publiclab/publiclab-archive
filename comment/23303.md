 This will take a while- so bear with m e.

Many black plastic bags are made of polyvinyl chloride ( PVC).  When this degrades, it generates hydrochloric acid ( HCl).  This usually grabs the nostrils in your nose and pulls.  Please check and see if the bags being produced are PVC.

The degradation, when it does occur, should only happen when the plastic sees a lot of extra heat.  Usually, this is when there has been a power outage, and the pvc in the extruder has been allowed to cool without moving.  When power comes back on, there will be a lot of extra heat seen by the pvc  and extra HCl generated.

There are other situations, too.  Sometimes, during cleanout, it happen.  But the first step is to see if the plant uses PVC.  Then see if the detection method could identify HCl.  Maybe use a draeger tube for HCl the next time, just to be sure.
