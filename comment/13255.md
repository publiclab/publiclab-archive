Hi Parth,

The primary difference between your two photos is exposure. The bright one is overexposed. If there is software that allows you to control the exposure while you take photos you should be able to get better photos. 

To get meaningful NDVI images directly from your photos the camera will have to allow custom white balancing. Without an artificial adjustment to the relative brightness of the blue and red channels in each photo, NDVI computed from the photos will not be useful. Most webcams do not allow custom white balance.

Another possibility is to adjust the values in the blue and red channels after the photos are taken. To know how to adjust the values, targets of known reflectance in the red and NIR can be placed in each photo and the procedure outlined here can be followed: https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/07-22-2015/introducing-the-calibration-plugin-for-imagej-fiji
