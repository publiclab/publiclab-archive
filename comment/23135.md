OK well if I remember rightly Settings as you show above doesn't change the camera settings. It allows you to select your sample slice through the spectrum, if necessary to reverse the image and other stuff to do with the SW web interface. The SW pages can sometimes be a bit slow to respond making it hard to follow what is supposed to happen.
Once the spectrometer is fully assembled there is often very little light coming through that slit. The dynamic range of the web cam is not that big so it can be essential that exposure and gain are controllable. Also things like white balance and or colour temperature will have an effect on your results. For calibration start with a CFL lamp really close to the slit and wobble the spectrometer back and forth to see if you get any kind of image. Usually with the lamp close you will get an overexposed image and need to either preset the gain and exposure or move the lamp away. If you still can't get an image either camera is faulty, is getting pre-set to low values of gain and exposure or the geometry of the parts inside your spectrometer is way, way off.
