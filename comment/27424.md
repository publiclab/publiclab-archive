Addendum:
Works fine in Google Chrome.. so it appears to be a Firefox thing even though all "security" parameters were set to allow the use of the camera.
Everything seemed t be good.
Oh well various browser things do happen

 Now things work in Chrome EXCEPT capture window is too small and there seems to be no way to expand it or move it. "Blue" area goes out of bounds.
As you can see by the above camera capture it's not on the cameras fault exactly.
Well unlike a real camera on camera corrections are limited but doesn't cause what I am referring to.

This is a cool white LED so should have a big spike in the blue .
