This is a gravimetric sensor:

In theory, don't PM particles have different weight, depending on atomic content.

If you were to use a mesh to restrict the filtered particle size then have them land on a gravimetrically sensitive plate then couldn't you record the gradual increase in the weight of the settled particles, to work out how much of what is in the air at any time? Or is that too complicated?
