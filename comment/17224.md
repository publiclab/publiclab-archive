Hi, Elongo, I didn't reach the goal to measure health of plants most because Red Horning wrote me, by private mail, the that technique wasn't proper to detect small reductions of plant health determineted during the day o cycle of cultivation how I hoped.

I'm continuing the project, very slowly ....

However I found very interesting to observe realized timelapse to study the cycle of plants and for understanding eventualy some critical moments, plant stages and so on.  

So, then I replaced "IR modulo CAM" with a normal (visible spectre) "modulo CAM" and I focused to add   some sensors. 

I collected 68,000 data by that sensors and I obtained a new timelapse from january to july of indoor plants.

You can see the timelapse here

You can download the data from here

clicking "Data Export" button.

Now I'm testing some differents soil moisture sensors and I'm continuing collect data from another plant.

You can see the picture and the enviromental data in real-time here

I'm going to use again IR in future putting both IR (IR modulo CAM) and visible camera (normal usb webcam) on Raspberry PI to avoid the calibration target problem. But it is not my immediate goal.

Thanks everybody

Best regards
