Hi Kloots,
I think you are working with a really old the sketch.  At one point the code assumed that the trans2ByteA and trans2ByteB were added to the SPI libarary.  More recent versions use the altSPI library instead of the SPI library.  I think you should be able to fix this just by changing all the SPI.command() lines in the code to altSPI.command().  For example,
  altSPI.setModule(0);
  altSPI.begin();
  altSPI.setClockDivider(SPI_CLOCK_DIV64);  
Of course, I think the best thing to do is to get the most recent versions of the sketches off the GitHub site.  Let me know if that doesnt fix the problem.
