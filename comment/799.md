Will do.

I have actually further modified it and the code to have two modes, the adjustable temperature scales as noted above, or dynamic temperature scales.  The latter automatically changes the upper and lower limits on the temperature scale based on the maximum and minimum temperatures encountered since it was turned on.  That way, you can get it to use the full colour scale in every situation.  Of course, it does mean that the colour - temperature match up is always different, but that isn't an issue for the manner in which I use it.
