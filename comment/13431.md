I tried cutting the new version and it worked pretty well:

I worked to insert the LED (which could be a laser diode) dial, and Trinket (arduino clone) into the enclosure.

Unfortunately, the "stack" hits the components when you insert it, so it had to be modified quite a bit. I think that a different design for the stack, which incorporates the mounting of the components, is probably the way to go. Then you'd insert the stack into the box, it'd be stable on its own, and the screw of the knob would still stick through the outer box before the cap went on. 

Anyways I just cut the stack paper away to make room for all the parts, and used lab tape to stick things in. The USB port peeks out nicely:

I also added some tabs and slots to make it stay closed without tape. I want to work on the rest before recomposing a digital file, though.
