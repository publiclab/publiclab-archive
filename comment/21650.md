Hey everyone! I participated in GSoC'2018 as a student developer with public lab. I am also looking for GSoC'2019 opportunity. I have multiple projects in my mind. For now, one of them is :
As publiclab website is getting bigger and lots of new features are getting embedded into it, it is affecting website efficiency and performance and also making the new feature more difficult on the website as the website grows more in future. For such a big website like publiclab we have to move somewhat to any front-end framework in near future. So what we can do is that we can parallelly work on the frontend framework like angular and when it gets mature enough we can replace it with rails frontend. In the process, we can obviously use rails backend which is already made.
This is a very big project (could take a whole year to complete )and I have just added the idea so that people can do brainstorming over it and find out is it worth doing this or not.
