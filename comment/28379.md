According to LSU, the Mean Annual Flux of microplastic (0.5mm - 5mm) is** 325.3 Billion Particles per year**. 

If one piece is one dollar, that is 1.8x the net worth of Jeff Bezos. That's about how many meters it takes to get to the moon. 

What else do you know that is 325.3 Billion?!?

That's 2449 - 4067 Particles per year per person in the Basin
