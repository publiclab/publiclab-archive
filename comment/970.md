> so i'm interested in triangulation -- like, how can we independently verify that there is H2S at a test site? I have an electronic H2S sensor connected to an Arduino, and i recently got a temperature/humidity sensor (since the H2S sensor is temp/humidity sensitive too) to correct the H2S readings. I also got a little SD card holder/writer for the Arduino, so I could put together a little package that records H2S and logs the results, for comparison with the strips. Then we'd at least have 2 separate readings of the site. Also:

> A. the H2S sensor I have can only detect like 5 ppm minimum (i think, i'll have to check again) so it's interesting to compare this to either the strip sensitivity or that of the human nose (0.3ppm, see [1] below) . Or the max safe exposure level -- say, 15-20ppm see [2] below.

> B. though this'd be an interesting comparison and a great way to gain confidence in the strip technique, we shouldn't take for granted that the digital sensor is "better" or even particularly authoritative
