Huh, i think you know a lot more than I do about ATmegas! 

We're thinking of doing our own modded version of the Visualight board in some quantity, or perhaps a daughterboard with the Melexis on it. That, plugged into a 2xAA USB battery booster could be a cheap and tiny all-inclusive flashlight. 

But the Sparkfun board is also open source. Besides the need for an FTDI cable, do you see other advantages to the Sparkfun board as the basis for our flashlight board.
