[@dhaffnersr](/profile/dhaffnersr): assuming that the angles are right I think that it will be crucial to have good mirrors reflecting on a wide range of wavelengths without absorbing too much (four reflection before the grating are a lot). Btw I ordered your [webcam](https://publiclab.org/notes/dhaffnersr/05-09-2016/new-upgrade-today-for-my-spectrometer-new-ccd-camera-module).
