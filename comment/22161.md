 Hi Chris,
          I have two dedicated IR cameras, a Sony DSCV1 and a Sony F717. Should I be able to use these, and simply put the filter in front of the lens?
When you say,'reasonable results' can you refer me to the location, presumably on the Publiclab site, that describes what 'reasonable results' are? 
Thanks,
....... john
