When calibrating against the sun it seems like the spectrum would vary significantly depending on atmospheric conditions (e.g. in a smoggy city, during a sunset or on a overcast day).

I think you've ruled out using emission spectroscopy for analyzing material composition with a simple experimental setup. But perhaps it's possible to use absorption spectroscopy to determine an objects composition from reflected light-bulb light.
