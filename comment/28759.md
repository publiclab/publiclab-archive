Thank you [@sarasage](/profile/sarasage) - that helps. The AQ data is being captured in your data logger disconnected from the GPS coordinates being captured in GPSKit.

Your desired future state would be to have a single device that could capture the air quality information tied to the sample location feeding up to a datastore, whether the collector is connected or disconnected to a digital network (as [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) referenced, we are lucky to have a lot we can pick from).

I hate to answer your question by asking more questions, but:

* the cellular devices currently being used, are they iOS, Android, Linux, or a mixed bag of nuts depending on the person in the community?

* do you or your organization have development skills or experience in building hardware or extending edge devices like a Grove, Raspberry Pi, or something similar?
