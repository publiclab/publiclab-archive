Thanks Chris -- this is incredibly useful.  So important for folks to have a sense of the trade-offs and considerations when choosing solutions in this realm.

One thing to point out:  the Feathers typically use a linear voltage regulator that can be enabled / disabled with a pin that is broken out on the board -- "En".  When that pin is pulled low, the linear regulator no longer operates, and draws minimal power.  The idea is that you can then supply 3V directly to the "3V" pin to power the other electronics on board.  To achieve lower-power operation, you would then choose some 3V battery arrangement (a coin cell, 2 AA's, etc) and connect it to "3V".  (You might even be able to do this by running a jumper wire from the 3V coin cell battery on the 'adalogger' shield!)  I'd be very curious to see what sort of current draw you get while sleeping in such an arrangement, as I suspect it'd be quite low for the M0 in sleep mode. If you have a e.g. a 2xAA pack (or want to give the jumper wire trick a shot), maybe you could try it out.  I think you would simply connect "En" to "GND", and then apply the battery to "3V" and "GND".  If you do try this, be careful not to supply much more than 3.3V -- e.g., you would probably not want to use a 3.7V Li-ion battery.
