Wow, that's really cool. Would you be able to post some pictures of [your stability upgrade](https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/09-16-2016/stability-upgrade-mockup-for-plab-spectrometer-3-0) as a response by clicking the button on the bottom of that post? We're eager to collect feedback, even if it's just a confirmation that people are able to successfully build it and upload a photo. 

I love the mounting idea too -- actually if you have photos of that and the darkened interior, both would be great to see -- the latter as a "replication" of this page's upgrade. The more people that successfully replicate an upgrade, the more confidence we can have in it!
