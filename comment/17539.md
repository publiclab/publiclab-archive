[@azaelb](/profile/azaelb) There's something I don't really get. Basically what we need to do is to remove the ir cutter from inside the camara and place the red filter outside? Me and a colleague disagree, he thinks the red filter goes inside, replacing the ir cutter, I think you take the ir cutter out and place the red filter outside.
