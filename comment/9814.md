Ah, that hasn't been in line with previous ideas about annotation permissions. We don't want carefully added annotations to be deletable. Based on my most recent event, people spend a lot of time typing up their knowledge and uploading photos into the infowindows. It would be bad if anyone could just delete that. Currently, anyone can add annotations to a map, but only the person who has added a given annotation can delete it. I think the owner should be able to delete all annotations as part of managing their map. 

My question was more like, "once a map owner has added annotations, can they go in and edit it?" Currently, if you want to change an annotation, there's no was to do it, just have to delete and start over with a new annotation.
