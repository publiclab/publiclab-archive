This is great. I followed the first tutorial and made a nice 3D point cloud from 76 kite photos of a tundra study plot. At Flightriot.com, Geobduffy has a zip file with everything you need to install this free software (at least on 64 bit Windows). Now I have to follow the second tutorial and make a 3D model and project the photos onto it. Then I have to figure out how to share it. Very powerful stuff.
