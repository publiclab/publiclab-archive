This is a Chrome problem; they've been dragging their feet on camera selection for many months. Firefox and Opera have camera selection interfaces though. We should add a message about it, but in the meantime if you could +1 this issue so it actually gets fixed in Chrome, that'd be great: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=167264

There is no javascript interface for setting exposure; we work on the assumption that if there's relatively little light, it'll be at the max. If you think it'd help, we could have a blinky icon that encourages the user to hold it steady for a second before capturing?
