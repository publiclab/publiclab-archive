It finally dawned on me that this machine is a monochronomater, attenuater, and photometer.  To use it that way all you need to do is to bring out a portion of the beam with a 90/10 mirror and let the 10% hit the photometer.  To do this just modfy a cuvette by adding a 90/10 mirror at a 45 degree angle.  If you can find some multimode fiberoptic cable and mount it above the mirror and you are in business.  Otherwise you can mount the public lab spectrometer above the modified cuvette and "go to town" with the setup.
