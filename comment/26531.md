This is a great proposal! Echoing [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996), maybe `Automatic tagging of posts` could be held as a "stretch goal" for the end. I think there are some good modules like Askimet and others that could be used to provide "recommendations" for whether new posts are spam or not, and we could show these as icons in the list view to help you decide. 

Another way we could do this is we could have a button that says "suggest a categorization" or something which would check the boxes for you, of the list items that seem like spam according to some algorithm, Askimet, machine learning, or whatever, and you could visually review them but otherwise just use bulk actions to mark them all spam. 

I'd love to hear a bit about how you'd approach testing, both of the underlying system (functional and unit tests) and of the UI (system tests). This helps your code remain maintainable and readable as well!

Finally, perhaps some periods of discussion with site users is good to factor in so that you know if the systems you are designing are a good fit for people. 

Thank you!!
