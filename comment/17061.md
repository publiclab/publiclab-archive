LB: Hi [@carohowe](/profile/carohowe) i am wondering if there might be any use to starting with publicly available data on the DC urban heat island before building a lot of sensors? For instance, this data is available from NASA's ASTER satellite https://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/data.asp and LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM). Public Lab organizer [@lprashad](/profile/lprashad) works with ASTER data, and [@donblair](/profile/donblair) [@karenv](/profile/karenv) & [@nedhorning](/profile/nedhorning) have already posted how to use thermal imagery from LANDSAT
https://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/07-14-2014/how-to-download-and-use-landsat-images. I know this wasn't what your question was about, but it could potentially really inform your strategy as well as give you even more data to help illustrate your concerns.
