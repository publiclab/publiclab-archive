Great [@warren](/profile/warren) :   My responses, 
1. **planning the placement of sensors on a site:**
a) The site can be Indoor places(schools, office or outside space, balcony). check the power supply for the Sensor unit(power bank, it is fine else use a socket). Inside the house, test nearby kitchen, garage, balcony. 
b) Make it a drawing activity of the site and check for ventilation, door, rooms, chimneys, etc and place sensors in different places and test the readings.
2. **running a group activity to train people in placing sensors, whether this type or more expensive ones**
a)The orientation of the sensor plays a vital role in measuring air particulate matters. Ensure there is enough vent for air to pass through the outlet. (Make this as an activity, in which axis PM values varies). 
b)Make this a paper or cardboard drawing activity for casing the Sensor unit Test with Casing and non-casing the sensor unit
c) Ask people to investigate on other particles that cause Air pollution(they would come with Smoke, C02, No2, etc and talk about Sensors that could measure these particles. This would lead to self-investigation of the various sources of air pollution discussing the limitations of different types of sensors
3. **discussing how airflow affects readings**
a) Keep sensor unit near a Ceiling fan(with & without Dust particles), Table fan, Door top dust, humidifier, or substances like Smoke, paper smoke, Agarbatti, Perfume to test the Airflow and change in PM values for different substances.
b) you can even test by spraying or splashing Water/Rain (which in a way flow of air) from a distance of 2-10cm from the sensor unit to see if there is any change in the Particulate Matter values.
c)Add Temperature & humidity sensor to check if it affects Airflow and PM values.
4. **Sensor Value for an average period of time**
a) Add delay(60000); in the first line of void loop() to display value after 1 minute.
b) Use Ctrl + shift + L (serial plotter) to, make it a Graph.
d) Via Serial monitor, copy all the values and use Spreadsheet to find average values.
e) Connect over ESP8266 and Wifi to transfer data over Cloud and check for 1 minute once in Thingspeak easily.
