Hi [@pataxte](/profile/pataxte) - your image is just so spectacularly high resolution on a cm/px basis that 25 or even 10 cm/px was too small to get a readable image. 10cm/px means each pixel represents a 10cm square. So I tried exporting with 3cm/px and then 1cm/px and was able to get decent images.

I believe you should be able to do even lower, like 0.2cm/px. That would mean that each pixel would be an unbelievable (from the perspective of satellite imaging) 2mm x 2mm ðŸ˜± ðŸ›° ðŸ”­ ðŸ”¬
