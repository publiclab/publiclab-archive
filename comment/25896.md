Maybe we could do both sound and light? That way it is adaptable for different abilities too. 

I don't know if we could have one port drive a light, slowly, and a second port drive a buzzer, 10x speed?

Secondly, I was also thinking of sensitivity, and had thought of a logarithmic scale. But, that could add some complexity in reading it, like, blinking 2x as fast means... uh... see, i can't even do that in my head, but i'm not great at this kind of math. Maybe there's another way to add resolution to the blink, without losing range? 

Thanks for the input!
