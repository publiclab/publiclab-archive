I've been wondering about making a "Portrait Book" of various particles, such as dust, combusted fuel, silica, metal shards, micrometeorites, etc. We could throw in some larger scale references like a human hair for relatability, context, and humor. 
One microscopic portrait filling each page of a 4" square booklet. 
Anyone else like this idea?
