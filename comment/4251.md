I don't think that disconnecting the green light would make much of a difference.  It's supposed to be an indicator that the camera is in use (so people don't have to be paranoid about someone taking control of their camera and watching them through it), so if it's working correctly, it should light up whenever you have the camera plugged in and are running a program that tries to view the input from the camera, and it should not light up when you are not doing that.

However, if the camera isn't working anyway, I guess it's junk and it won't hurt to mess around with it and try whatever you like ;)
