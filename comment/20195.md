MaggPi you are correct that presenting color-mapped data-based images without presenting the colormap key makes the images mostly meaningless to viewers.

The default color map looks like it might be a standard heat map with cold-to-warm colors. 

The Fastie colormap is based on the one described here: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/08-26-2014/new-ndvi-colormap
It is intended for traditional NDVI images of vegetation in which values less than 0.1 are not healthy foliage. It also includes an error checking color (magenta) to highlight values that might be due to artifacts. The version in image sequencer might differ from the original. To avoid confusion, this might be a good thing to change.
