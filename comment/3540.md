Unfortunately I don't have any thermistors or even potentiometers available for testing right now. I do have a heaping helping of resistors that I can twist and tie in series and parallel to effect whatever resistance I want to test, one test point at a time.

However, I will follow up with a research note of its own and post it in a comment here when I do. I have some wave data I recorded on my smart phone that I created by testing 3 different levels of resistance (based on the microphone's own resistance measurements). I wanted to see if I could read a fairly flat line if resistance did not change 48000 cycles per second or whatever my BT unit samples at.

As of right now, the methodology sounds cool, but for some reason my bluetooth hands-free unit has become very picky about whom it will send microphone data to.  I must have zapped something useful somewhere on the circuit board. The unit now sends a flatline to my PC. It will send audio to my smartphone every other time I turn it on; happily, that is good enough for recording and testing.
