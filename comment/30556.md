For this group assignment we are to choose out of the four spheres, and determine the condition based on the location of your choice. Geosphere is the condition of the land. Atmosphere is the condition of the air. Hydrosphere is the condition of the water. Biosphere is how the humans are affected or the life surrounding the prior three spheres. With different locations, the conditions are different, we choose the location of our school. These spheres either affect humans or the humans can affect our environment. As example, humans are constantly polluting the air with plants and littering in the ocean, etc. 
  
The air quality is particularly moderate in Reserve, Louisiana. The pie chart on the EPA website, shows a pie chart depicting 71 percent of moderate air quality in August 2015 on the “My Air” section. The good part of the pie chart is approximately 25 percent on, and the unhealthy part is about 5 percent. The hydrosphere in reserve is a little scary. 90% of the samples that was taken from Reserve water system were at or right below 0.002 mg/L of lead in the water. That was based on the EPA’s ECHO Database which means the levels of lead are 13.3% of the 0.015 mg/L that is the level in which the water is not safe to drink. This means 10% of the samples that are taken from the Reserve contained more lead. Due to the plant's facilities, we are surrounded by with the chemicals that goes to waste onto our land it’s a total DANGER to our soil, our land, & our community. In the site of EPA, the link states that the hazardous waste such as liquid which we are endangered to contains properties that are dangerous or potentially harmful to human health plus the environment. However, our land is not totally done for, the link also tells how to properly manage & dispose of these toxic wastes including with a chart. The toxic air pollutants that we have or suspected of causing cancer, or other serious health problems. But not all air pollutants are toxic. People should still be cautious and know what they are breathing in every day.
