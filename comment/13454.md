Very cool idea!  
Marking up the bottom photo with some arrows and text to identify the physical components would be helpful.  I am still a bit lost on the location of several of the components you mention.  

Regarding the control and data acquisition: 

Clearly you will need power to the unit, any idea of the how much?  What voltage and what is the current draw?


It sounds as if the mirror(or grid) will rotate much as it does now.  What is driving that rotation?  Constant speed DC motor? Stepper motor?  

Can you identify the output of the detector?  Is there a part number so one can get the spec sheet?  

Control really should not be much of an issue for an Arduino or Arduino-like controller based on what you are describing.  However, getting hold of and processing the output of the detector is the unknown.  I am vaguely familiar with spectrometers from years ago when we were using them to monitor plasma deposition of copper on hard drive components, but I did not have to work with them on the component level, so am curious about how this might work.

The concept is great!  The idea of a battery powered spectrometer that size is very attractive.
