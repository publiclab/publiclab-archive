Babu,
Here is a paper about getting separate NIR and red bands by doing what Ned suggested – subtracting one band from another: http://cigr.ageng2012.org/images/fotosg/tabla_137_C1122.pdf

Here is a modified camera that can produce “NDVI” images -- http://www.maxmax.com/vegetation_stress_mkii.htm

The filter in this “vegetation stress” camera blocks red and passes NIR, and replaces the IR block filter in the camera -- http://www.maxmax.com/ndvi_camera_technical.htm

This site has some very useful data about the sensitivity of cameras with their IR block filters removed -- http://www.maxmax.com/spectral_response.htm . These illustrate that the blue channel will include quite a bit of NIR data. This means that when the blue channel is used as a substitute for red in the calculation of NDVI, the result will be far from perfect. Unless you can figure out how to "subtract" NIR from the blue channel.

The filter used in the vegetation stress camera is apparently not available unless you pay MaxMax to install it in a camera.
