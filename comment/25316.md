These particular sensors, the way they are programmed, is to test a range between 0 and 20 micrograms per cubic meter, where 0 is green, and red is 20 (or anything beyond 20). You will also see a range of colors between green and red as the sensor detects more particulate matter. It's important to note these sensors don't take into account humidity or other factors that might alter what the sensor reads.
