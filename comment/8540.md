Thanks, mathew!  I really enjoyed your roundup of the work that's been done so far on MapKnitter annotations.  It reminded me a lot of Edward Tufte's approach to information design, and I'm a huge fan of his work.

What do you think of the scope of the project, as I defined it above?  When I was writing it up, it seemed like it was not nearly enough for basically 3 months, BUT, at the same time, I'd rather complete the project early and then address some of the "Stretch goals" than be scrambling at the last minute to pull it together and have to leave it unfinished.
