Thank you for your reply.  At this point I am trying to minimize the cost of developing this approach, so I want to stick with the webcam in the kit.  Examination of the webcam indicates it uses a pinhole as a lens, and has an AR-coated window that might include the IR filter.  I'm not adverse to modifying the webcam -- I'm a retired electrical/electronics engineer so I'm familiar with ESD-preventing measures.  Do you know if it is possible to remove the IR filter?

I suppose one negative aspect of removing the window is that dust could enter the camera and lodge on the sensor -- but the diffraction grating would act as a dust-blocker so no harm there.

Thanks!
Mark
