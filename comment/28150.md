Another weird approach.  Their are already a number of inexpensive water tests available on amazon.  These tests are labeled as heavy metal, although they may not cover the whole range.  The range of elements covered needs further investigation.  But the cost is inexpensive and they should already be validated.  They would need modified for soil.
