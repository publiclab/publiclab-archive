[@Ranon](/profile/Ranon) and I went out flying last night, and with the gusty conditions had trouble getting the panorama more than a few feet off the ground-- our 9' deltas were squirrelly.  That said, we tried the carabiner wrap in the field, and the carabiner makes it tough to wrap and unwrap the down-line side of the wire.  We ended up just wrapping into the carabiner and then wrapping the kite side of the line around the wire.  That was felt very secure, but may eliminate some of the safety effect we were looking for. Ranon has pictures, so stay tuned..

  I think the J shape you're talking about may be the way to go-- more experimentation is needed.

I really love the bike-tube plate, I might have to make myself one of those.  I was thinking the same thing regarding mounting multiple Mobius cameras to capture several angles.  Without servos a tilt mechanism gets real finicky, and your earlier concerns about getting a "spiral" panorama and being unable to match pan to tilt seem on the money from the limited tests we did.
