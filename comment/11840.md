There seems to be a lot of marketing hooey at the Agribotix site. They seem to be doing DIY uncalibrated infrared vegetation index work like a lot of people in the Public Lab community. They have decided that green is the best visible channel for vegetation indices without mentioning some [very good reasons to use red](http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/11-01-2013/why-a-red-filter-should-work-well-for-ndvi). They have decided that simply subtracting green from NIR (called DVI) is better than NDVI because the images look better to them.  They "expand the histogram" without attempting to explain what that is or how it might help. They have looked at a lot more aerial infrared images of farm fields than I have, but they don't present much evidence that their approach is more reliable than many others or why it should be. They are commercializing the type of DIY approaches that the Public Lab community has been involved with. More power to them.

The current version of Ned's Fiji plugin will compute either NDVI or DVI.
