Jeff, thanks for pointing this out. I admit I do find the SWB terminology a bit overloaded and the user interface 'unexpected' as I'm not used to it. I'd thought that the Solux plot had used the CFL-2700k cal as a reference but I must have noticed the x-axis pixel values and hit 'calibrate', intending to tell SWB to 'calibrate' the spectra using the last CFL reference I'd specified in the interface when I took the data -- as opposed to 'use this plot to calibrate the spectrometer'. It does seem that SWB can't tell the Solux plot is not a CFL. As for the level, yes, it seems off but I was rushed (a bad thing) and guessed SWB was just scaling the data for display.
