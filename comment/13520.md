Hmm, I can't see any spectra on your profile at https://spectralworkbench.org/profile/smurpau

Are you sure the earlier spectrum you posted was a fluorescent tube? Such a tube should work; see https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/02-04-2016/tube-fluorescent-lamps-for-spectrometer-calibration

Any chance your slit fell out of something? A very very large aperature can look like this.
