Hi, all - just noting that a few new things have happened on this page since this sketch was posted:

1. new contributors have recently added this great `Related tags` display on the tag page, shown below
2. we have "ranges" now (i.e. showing content on the topic but within a date range, like https://publiclab.org/tag/balloon-mapping?start=01-01-2018&end=01-08-2018), but are looking to add better UI for date range selection ([see this issue](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/2439)) 
3. we're also looking to integrate a link to the stats page that corresponds with the ranges shown above (eventually)

I hope this doesn't complicate things unduly - the related tags is the only one that ought to be more prominent; the others could be less visible to newcomers.
