Hi Jeff--
My knowledge of smart phones apps and anything web based is just about zero.  I am aware that these things exist.  That is about it.  
With that disclaimer, I see no reason that the instrument could not communicate with the web.  While our potentiostat is currently tethered to a laptop via a micro-USB cable, I suspect that you are more interested in remote sensing applications where the instrument is powered by a battery and communicates wirelessly.  I am sure that can be done but it is outside of my experience.  I know that a number of shields exist for wireless / blue tooth / zigbee communications with the LaunchPad.  I see no reason why the data could not be transmitted (as serial data?) using one of these to a nearby computer that could transfer it to the web.  We wrote the GUI using Processing and the book I use, Learning Processing by Shiffman (good book by the way), says that you can export web applets written in this program.  Perhaps I can convince a student to work on this point this spring.

As far as identifying metals goes, to some extent, the metal can be identified by the voltage at which it undergoes electron transfer.  I say "to some extent" because other things in solution can bind the metal and shift the measured voltage one way or the other.  The most common way to assure yourself that you know the identity of the metal is to make the measurement, spike your sample with the metal you suspect and measure again.  If it is the metal you thought, the signal will grow.  The amount by which it grows gives you a good measure of the concentration of the metal.
Hope that answered your question.
Jack
