Pinging back in with some more resources. Got an email follow up to this post from [@silentsairam](/profile/silentsairam) I'll share it below! 


"With respect to your question on "Air pollution in Indoor environment specific to Hair Salons" on Public Lab  forum, sharing here some of the links and papers that might give more insights & necessary information for the same.

Key points:
1) All papers focuses on the primary pollutant HCHO.
2) Addition to that, benzene and all VOCs.
3) Throws more on testing samples , results and Indoor structure of salons.
4) Diseases caused by these chemicals on longer term.
