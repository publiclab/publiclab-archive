I think that's the [Emma Kites stainless steel kite winder](http://www.emmakites.com/11-strong-stainless-kite-line-reel-with-brakes-control-us-stock_p166.html?zenid=n5jfnmsroacld8e5tjv64so9v1)
I have one. its cool, but is very finicky and easy to get the string wrapped around the break if one is not careful.  I don't use it in workshops because of this rapid failure mode, but alone I feel comfortable with it.
