I suggest you try aliexpress.com instead of Amazon -- why pay double or more money for stuff when you can buy it direct from China?  They are an umbrella for many different sellers.  And they have a decent customer support procedure if, as sometimes happens, something you buy doesn't make it all the way across the Pacific.  Delivery can be very slow.
