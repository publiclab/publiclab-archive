cool.  My understanding is that, at least for coal dust (=mostly crystalline silica), most particles of interest fall in the PM10 category.

GCMonitor is working on a public release on coal dust with some numbers on extent of impact from terminal operations, size of particles, and health concerns.  once that goes live, I'll share it. 

couldn't find that Clean Air paper through my contacts, could you share it with me, though, when you get it?  I have a public health student writing about C.Silica working for GRN.
