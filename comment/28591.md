Hi [@lukoyedith](/profile/lukoyedith), is this proposal meant to be similar to the one you posted as a Wiki? I had some feedback for that, which I think you can reuse for this one as well.

I would suggest you have a look at past proposals, to get a feel of the format/details you can add https://publiclab.org/tag/outreachy

For the research idea you have posted, is it part of the 2021 ideas or is it a subset of one of the ideas? Would you consider picking one of the 2021 ideas?
