Charlie: The images everyone is working on are single photos from the cameras (or multispectral versions). The problematic color variations are within individual images.
Tom: There are definitely clouds reflected in the water on the left side of the photo 7075, and in some other photos. Most of the leaves of Trapa and other plants in these photos are wet, so light can reflect off their surface when the angle is right. Even in a single photo, the northern sky can be reflected off the surface in the northern part of the photo, and the southern sky with sun or bright clouds can reflect off the southern part of the photo. 
I think to embed an image in a comment the image has to be online already, so you can  insert a Flickr image with code from there.
