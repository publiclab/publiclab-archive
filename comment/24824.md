[@hagitkeysar](/profile/hagitkeysar) and me are talking about the very same camera. 

It didn't look like a bug. The camera worked as described in its manual [which I can't find online, Drograce WP200] with three modes: photo, video and car. It didn't have time-lapse mode.

We found the burst option inside the photo mode, but it only takes 3 images each time.
