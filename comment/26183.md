Thank you so much, Chris! 
With respect to what to use as a reference to calibrate the White Balance (WB), I have not yet "digested" whether your recommendation is confusing or clear, but what I have been doing in general for WB calibration is as follows, always with the external filter of interest already attached: 

A.  If the filter includes any portion of the visible light (abbrev. VZ) spectrum to pass to the image sensor, I employ an 18% gray cloth for calibration; 

B.  If the filter passes light only with wavelengths greater than 700 nm, then I calibrate to a chlorophyll-containing structure, e.g. green grass or a healthy leaf. 

What do you see are the pitfalls of my approach to WB calibration, whether in general or with specific respect to optimizing WB for NDVI images?
