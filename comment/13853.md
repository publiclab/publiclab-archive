The red filter in your Mobius is blocking most blue light but passing most of the NIR light in the scene. The blue channel receives little other visible light because the camera's Bayer filters are blocking most red and green. The only light that can be captured by the blue channel is NIR. 

Compact fluorescent lamps do not emit much NIR:

So if the scene is lit only by a CFL, the blue channel is going to be very dark regardless of what is in the scene. The blue channel is used to represent NIR (when a red filter is used), and when NIR is lower than VIS, NDVI will be negative. 

The interpretation of NDVI values is based on the proportion of visible to NIR light in sunlight. When the scene is lit with a very different proportion of VIS:NIR, NDVI values will not be in the "normal" range. You could still make comparisons between stressed and healthy plants, but not with NDVI values from scenes with different lighting.
