I've noticed that we use the word reproducibility/replicability towards (at least) two ends: 
1) can you build a tool according to instructions that succeeds at reaching a "Hello World" benchmark; and 
2) can you reproduce the findings of a research project.

It may be confusing that our community uses the word "research" to apply to both tool development AND to environmental research using such tools. 

Thanks Phil [@p_silva_82](/profile/p_silva_82) for chatting about this.
