Caleb Hall- 3/7/2022- Video Observation
 Many pollution statistics can usually make the audience feel its a far away issue, when in reality its not. Most major rivers that run through our country such as the Mississippi have issues with with plastic pollution. Only a few places have government funded research centers for plastic pollution issues and cleanup, so a lot of the work is left for the public to do. To aid research and public cleanup, Dr. Jenna Jambeck came up with the idea of having her students mark down the geographical coordinates of plastic litter they found. This idea would eventually become the Marine Debris Tracker app, which allows them to show what, when, and wear the plastic litter is. This app has begun to show how major events such as the Covid-19 pandemic  affect plastic pollution; in this case the pandemic  to led to an increase of litter in the form of face masks. Overall, plastic pollution is still an extremely prevalent issue, but  can be something we can actually overcome if we work together.
