The mirror arrays are looking more and more attractive because of their light-efficiency and compactness.  Also, since I can now order cast and high-gloss polished 3D printed sterling silver and gold-plated brass [from Shapeways.](http://www.shapeways.com/materials/silver) it seems like a small, high-efficiency, optical grade mirror screw could cost a little over $100 to manufacture.

Here's the [original mirror screw patent from 1928.](https://www.google.com/patents/US1753697).  Check out these pretty good images from [a contemporary re-built mirror screw set](http://www.earlytelevision.org/color_mirror_screw.html) that has a ~7" picture.  Here's [some more info.](http://televisionexperimenters.com/MSTechnology.html)

The original 1928 patent it is referenced by a 1955 patent using a [mirror screw in a single-sensor electronic camera](https://www.google.com/patents/US3001013).  This is almost exactly what we want to do, although its a slit-scan system for aerial photography and we want to take full frame images.  It makes me hopeful that mirror screws were more than just a 1930's curiosity, and that the light capture of a mirror screw is enough to resolve an image.
