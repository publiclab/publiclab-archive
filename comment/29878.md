For the project, we rode to Edgard in a certain spot next to the Mississippi River. We utilized the sticks and attach the to the trawls. We went through a process of one group at a time and we collected the plastics but using the stick to slap the bucket on the water and collect plastics. Also, as we were waiting we used our Marine Debris Tracker App to note, document, and clean certain items that was there. Nurdles were not present.
