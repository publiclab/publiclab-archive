Superb!!!
This was EPIC. You did a lot of stuff folks. 1+1 = 11. You guys proved it.
Upgrading Rails version of itself a big hurdle for PL. With that you managed to enhance many other parts of PL. This is awesome.
I really loved that you worked out of scope of your project too like in future work, map integration and many more mentioned above.
Thanks for contributing at PL
