I've added an alternative top bar (instead of the text input), maybe this would indeed be simpler :) 

The design is here: https://edieblu.github.io/pl-dashboard/

Please note that you'll have to scroll down to see the Dashboard design. I've placed the Questions Page on top, as that one hasn't been reviewed as much yet. 

Let me know what you think :)
