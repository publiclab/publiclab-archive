I think it is not possible. The filter is placed under the lens, so you need to unmount the whole part as shown on the picture above and then removing the filter was very easy. It is a thin solid filter made of glass, so I don't think you can peel of just a layer of it. Can you upload your picture on public place like Picassa or Dropbox and share your link here? Thanx
