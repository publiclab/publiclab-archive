[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) Thanks Chris, I'd had forgotten this particular mod by Ed Mallon, and didn't notice the mods on your modules. I need to go back and review those discussions more closely.  The RTC modules I am using are not the ones I rec'd from you. When I get back to this, it won't hurt for me to highlight the mods again on the research note.  Tentative data logger package: 5V pro-mini, mod existing RTC, (maybe) drive with 9V battery.
