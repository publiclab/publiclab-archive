It's good to know about the NDRE. Instead of computing the difference between reflected NIR and reflected red light, I think NDRE replaces reflected red (600 to 700 nm) with a band at the edge of red and NIR, somewhere between 690 and 730 nm. This has been shown to be more sensitive to early plant stress than NDVI. 

When we use a "720 nm" filter, it is a filter that passes all wavelengths longer than 720 nm (all NIR) and blocks all shorter wavelengths (all visible light). So that filter is used to produce a pure NIR band between 720 and about 900 nm (upper limit depends on the camera). This band is used as the NIR information in NDVI. 

NDVI = (NIR – Red)/( NIR + Red)

NDRE = (NIR – Red_edge)/( NIR + Red_edge)

It is easy to capture a red edge band with an unmodified camera and a Wratten 89B filter. That filter passes only wavelengths longer than 690 nm, and the IR block filter in the camera passes only wavelengths shorter than about 730 nm (depends on cmaera). Not much light would get through both filters (and the Bayer filters) so exposures might have to be long. The red channel could record a good red edge band.
