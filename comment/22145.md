 A little known group, Quantum Photonic Research & Development, LLC, a start-up, has devised a plan to use a process and a device to limit the amount of run-off being detected by standard methods.  Rainwater run-off issues, considering the mounting evidence of Climate Change due to rapid regional, national and international weather patterns, is a concern now but will be a major health and safety problem in the next two decades.  

Without changes in crop, farm-animal, and feedlot practices, near future water-quality
monitoring may become moot?

It's all about the amount of water being used and how it is distributed...the topsoil can only hold so much...
