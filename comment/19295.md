Hi [@warren](/profile/warren) that sounds great I'll get one printed out and ready for use and should have it on its way within a few days. Your right about the standard method of attachment would be best for everyone once I get the Lego set I'll see if I can design a magnetic attachment without heavily modify the design.

Thanks
