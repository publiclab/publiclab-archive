UPDATE:6/29/15
   The Lidar LITE can now be purchased for under $100 through Sparkfun, Amazon etc...  I just recently found one at Robotshop.com on sale for $75 and it should be arriving tomorrow!  I intend to use it on my Naze32 quadcopter that I've been building for almost a year.  It is finally in its final stages and if all goes well, I'm hoping to have it in the air by next week!

  While I intend to post detailed documentation on the build once it gets off the ground, I wanted to start looking into ways to incorporate the LiDAR LITE into aerial mapping for which I have been using a Mobius ActionCam.
  [@smathermather](/profile/smathermather)- Does [#OpenDroneMap](/tag/OpenDroneMap) support the LiDAR-LITE?
