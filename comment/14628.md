Yes, a camera with a red filter replacing the IR block filter will make RGN photos. The green channel is probably mostly NIR, so it is really RNN. The red channel is really red plus NIR, so the photo is really (R+N)NN. 
The Photo Monitoring plugin can make a facsimile of NDVI from such photos, especially if the white balance of the camera exaggerates the brightness of the blue channel or if the process is calibrated.
