i will take a look. what is the lens diameter? if you have not had the chance to play with muscle wire it is really cool stuff. I would be happy to send you a piece.

After giving it a bit more thought, have you considered a 50% mirror at 45 and two cameras at 90? That would give you the instantaneous exposure you are after with no intervention required.

I'm not sure about the IR transmittance of the cheap beam splitter but we can check it out. It would probably be cheaper to buy two prisms and glue them together.
