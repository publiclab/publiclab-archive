At the risk of  missing his points, it sounds like [@david-days](/profile/david-days) is suggesting PLab might be described by (no particular order or emphasis) 1) environmental activism, 2) promote the collection of environmental data (broad definition), 3) involvement in low-cost, "accessible scientific measurement" devices and 4) promote "citizen science". Yes, I'm deliberately using a very broad brush. The reason is because I'd like to suggest that science is the common thread and the scientific method holds the fundamental concepts having the potential to keep all the components well grounded.

The legal, public, social, political issues of evidence are complex but all are limited by the science behind the data. Low-cost, "accessible", measurement devices are useful only to the degree of the science applied to their design, construction and use. "Citizen science" is only as valuable to the degree it remains true to scientific principles. Environmental activism is only as persuasive (long term) as permitted by the validity and openness of the science supporting it.

PLab provides sandboxes where interested citizens can explore but that doesn't guarantee everything in the sandbox will stand up under scientific inquiry -- but that's ok, because that's the definition of a sandbox. PLab also promotes science-based "stuff" (deliberately diffuse so as to be generally inclusive) and that part does require scrutiny and validation in order to pass scientific inquiry.

So, this is not an argument of the very real issues in [@david-days](/profile/david-days) reflections. Instead, it leverages those thoughts as a perspective that learning to follow the scientific method is the best reference point for keeping all niches of PLab well grounded.

I found the following quotes in an article in the Guardian science section, and thought they held some basic insight.

"...scientists keep on testing their own assumptions, and questioning their own observations. Yes, if they expect to find something, there is a likelihood that they will see what they are looking for, but they don’t like to be the only people to see it. The lesson is that good
science is replicable."

"...good scientists worry about tiny details: it’s not enough to be broadly right. If you can’t be dead right then something must be wrong."

"...Science is unique among human ways of knowing because it is self-correcting. Every claim is provisional.”

Cheers.
