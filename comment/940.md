Re: mailing list vs. forum, I agree -- i think the website (which has improved a lot recently) is a great place to do collab. research. I think the mailing list is older and many less internet-y folks are not as comfortable posting content as emailing people. It's low-barrier-to-entry. But go for it on the site if you're up for it.

The in-browser webcam version is actually already working in beta -- it's not as good as the java/processing client YET but it should get there in the next couple weeks. But it works:

I think the python idea is golden and we should do it. The only remaining need for a desktop client is offline use -- which the web client, though very cool and easy, doesn't address. A RP would be the ideal use case, and if you want to run it without a monitor, you know, that's perfect. The python program would be minimal -- none of the cruft of a user interface -- and doesn't really need to be cross-platform, although that wouldn't be that hard either.

Yeah -- imagine you log into this RP from a laptop, (having copied the python Spectral Workbench program onto the SD card) and you start it up from the commandline. Then it is recording every X seconds into a folder, or into a long file. 

I could see 2 ways to get the data off:

* turn off the RP, copy the file off the SD card, and upload it to the SW website, which imports all the data
* or, you can somehow log onto the RP using a browser while on the same wifi network and you see a webpage offering data for download. 

Something like that. The first way is prob. easier. Cool. Do you have any Python coding experience?
