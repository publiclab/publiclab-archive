Hi [@lekhidugtal](/profile/lekhidugtal) - i noticed you have a draft started (i'm an admin, but don't worry i didn't read it!) I wanted to say you are very welcome to share a draft for input and we would be happy to help you refine it. No pressure as we're not at the deadline yet, but just wanted you to know that sharing a draft early is perfectly OK and in fact encouraged! Thank you!!! I know you've been super active on the project recently too ðŸ˜ƒ 

Thanks to everyone for your proposals so far! I wanted to note also that we have opened a second project, which we are not 100% confirmed we'll be accepted for yet, but are hopeful. It relates to [Leaflet Environmental Layers](https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-environmental-layers/), and you can read more about it here:

as well as in this issue:

Thank you!!! ðŸŽ‰
