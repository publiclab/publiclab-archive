In the atmosphere of Laplace, 25.8% of the air is classified as good, 71% is moderate, and 3.2% is unhealthy. There are many radioactive gases in the air, making it unhealthy for consumption. Laplace has a low risk of being exposed to radon because we are in zone 3. There are over 30 million tons of food waste that was produced in 2015. 5.3% was composed from landfills and incinerators.

In most areas of Louisiana, the water is considered normal, but there are some areas that are considered unhealthy. Most areas near Lake Charles have unhealthy or below normal water streamflow levels. Toxic air put many at risk. These chemicals can cause birth defects and death.
