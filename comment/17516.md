It's ironic that IRB processes, which come directly out of the informed consent clause of the Nuremberg Code, could be used to actually withold information from a community. Informed consent is item [#1](/n/1) in the Nuremberg Code:

> Required is the voluntary, well-informed, understanding consent of the human subject in a full legal capacity.

I wonder if any case could be made in that vein, although I have a lot of problems with how IRB has calcified over the years to really objectify "subjects" despite its still-important ethical origins.
