I was thinking -- what if we had a collection of "training smells" -- made of harmless ingredients, as an aid to identify and categorize smells? I often have trouble describing smells verbally. 

I got the idea from an exhibition on Chinese spices in new york -- they used empty squeezable mustard bottles -- with the pointy tips -- and you tried to guess what the spice was from smell. The answer was on the bottom. 

Spices or harmless smelly things wouldn't perfectly simulate many of the smells we're talking about. But some might be helpful. What do you all think?
