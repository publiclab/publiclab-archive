As far as I can tell they are glass. The cheapest I could find one onshore was at Edmund Optics or Newport for about $150.

it appears the guy has not sold any for over a year, so he might sell them for a lot less. 

I'll check with some of my old contacts and see if i can get somebody to donate a piece of teleprompter glass. I fear it will be tempered for safety, making cutting it up very difficult, but I am not sure about that, nor am I sure the optical quality is adequate. We will see in time.
