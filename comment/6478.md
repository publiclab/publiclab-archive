chris fastie for president.  i think tallow looks like broccoli from up high.  it would be interesting to develop a color signature, or some kind of machine-readable "pattern" for different invasive species. 

The advantage of Color Infrared is that different plants have different phenologies, so that there may be optimal times of year to take pictures than can discern plants like trees from one another. at the class I took at USGS, the pearl of wisdom was that fall photography was always the best--half because we were talking about wetlands, and in our corner of the world, fall is a time of low water, too. but the changing season allows for photo interpreters to distinguish between species in an aerial photograph.
