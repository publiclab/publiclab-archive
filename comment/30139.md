Thankyou so much for the review [@cess](/profile/cess) !! I am glad you liked it ❤️ 

Currently, I thought of adding additional fields below the title of that particular map in grey text. For example ->

[![tuxpi.com.1650809155.jpg](/i/46507)](/i/46507?s=o)

A disadvantage of this placement is that the fields may look trivial. If we want to give them more importance, we can add another column of "Images" in the dashboard. Something like this ->

[![Screenshot_from_2022-04-24_20-03-50.png](/i/46511)](/i/46511?s=o)

This way we can give the desired attention to these additional fields and it will be easier for moderators to quickly scan through them. But, I am afraid this view may look more cluttered than the previous one.

It depends which factor we want to prioritize in order to finalize the look. I will be happy to hear your suggestions, thanks!
