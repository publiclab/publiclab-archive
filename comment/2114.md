Andy,
That's a really good suggestion. You can see what this research note might look like to those who are <a href="http://colorfilter.wickline.org/?a=1;r=;l=0;j=1;u=publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/10-31-2012/ndvi-output;t=p">red-green colorblind here</a> (the gigapan embed does not show up). I will talk to Ned Horning about coming up with a color table that will be more useful to those with protanopia.
Thanks,
Chris
