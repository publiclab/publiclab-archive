[@cristoforetti](/profile/cristoforetti), the camera focal distance is based on using a slit to simulate collimated light -- non-collimated light gives multiple diffraction angles for the same wavelength (spectral distortion). So, for simplicity, the camera is roughly focused on the slit. However, the camera's DOF is so deep that the practical distance isn't critical. Therefore, since the light is not actually collimated with these simple designs, the '20cm' works better than just shortening the distance to 10cm -- the spectral error is largely the angular variance based on slit width, camera aperture and distance.

If you are still prototyping .... you might consider thinking about a few additional factors: 1) using front-surface mirrors (broader spectrum, lower distortion and no internal reflections), 2) having many reflective surfaces increases the mechanical stability issues (you should be able to do it in 2) and 3) the shallow angles of the proposed housing can make unwanted reflections (off the channel side walls) a bigger problem as it's difficult to obtain truly non-reflective surfaces (perhaps keep it simple with an open box with no 'channels' and one or two well-placed baffles (think wide "slit") to stop unwanted reflections.
