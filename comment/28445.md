Thanks [@ruthnwaiganjo](/profile/ruthnwaiganjo) for the feedback 😃 

> - You have a section called other refinements since they are part of the project, I would recommend expounding further on them as you have in the other features.

I have added some details to them while I am working on expanding each of them further :)

> - I did not see these two features mentioned in the proposal: Develop ideas and prototypes for how to ensure “important” or expected content is surfaced and Ranking by recency, views - brainstorm with community reps

I believe they are part of the same feature-set i.e. `ranking important/expected content based on various filters like views,recency`. I have currently included under details of microservice. I believe it would be something similar to how sorting works in current search api( [Ref](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/HEAD/app/api/srch/shared_params.rb#L27-L29). Let me know if I didn't get it right and point me towards the correct direction :)

> - What are some of the tests you will include in the project? Unit, functional, system.

I plan to add all unit, functional and integration tests, since we need them all for all 'units' to work cohesively. I will be adding unit tests after completing each unit/functions. For integration tests, I prefer the top-down approach and testing each unit integration step by step and expanding. Functional tests for handling edge cases and other behavioral tests. I am open to other recommendations.

> - Are there any accessibility features you can think about in the project?

I will try to remain conformant with https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/. Any further pointers appreciated.

> - Any plans to make First Timer Issues as you work on your project? We appreciate issues that invite newcomers to Public Lab.

Definitely. This initiative really helped getting started with open source and with public lab, so I am very eager in continuing it.
