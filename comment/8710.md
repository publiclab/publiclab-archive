Nathan McCorkle linked to a teardown of a commercial nanodrop:

an alternate to the droplet appears to be an aperture that fills with liquid via surface tension.  here is a patent for such a device designed to replace cuvettes in spectrophotometers:

this is a surface tension technique for spreading out a sample between two plates:

they're making the beam splitters with photolithography, but laser-cutting the pattern into the double-sided sticky-tape cuvette I posted yesterday might be interesting:
