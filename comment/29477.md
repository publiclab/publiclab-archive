In the Chesapeake Bay, there is an approximately 1 cubic mile section that is considered a "dead zone." This is the result of excess nitrogen and phosphorus from human activities that cause huge algae blooms during warmer weather. This "dead zone" will result in massive fish kills and strain on commercial fisheries. That ~1 mile dead zone is equivalent to about 17 football fields that can't sustain aquatic life.
