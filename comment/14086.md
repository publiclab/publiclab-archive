Dear David, I believe that in principle the back-scattering configuration should work fine, maybe except because it implies the lose of half of the laser light and also a half of the generated signal. Thus only 25% of the potentially attainable signal is kept and perhaps the normal consumer grade digital still photo cameras are not sensitive enough (an ISO sensitivity of 25600 is not really high for spectroscopy purposes). I would say just try it.

Best regards,

Eduardo.
