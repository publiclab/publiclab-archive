[@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) gc/ms is the standard way that bucket samples have been analyzed in the past, but it's expensive compared to the cost of the bucket.  I'm familiar with this methodology a *little* bit -- as in, I have seen diagrams of how mass spectrometers work-- but I'm not a chemist and have never run these types of samples myself.  Is gc/ms typically used as a standard method for air sampling?  Looking at the EPA's market research for consumer air sensors, it looks like this is not actually a super common way of analyzing VOCs.
