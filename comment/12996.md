Hi Thomas,

There has been a long discussion of this very topic here today. It happened in the comments to a four year old research note on a mostly unrelated topic, so you might have missed it. Check out today's comments on this note: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-27-2011/video-tutorial-creating-false-color-ndvi-aerial-wetlands-imagery#comments

One of the issues was whether the Public Lab filters are the best ones for this purpose.
