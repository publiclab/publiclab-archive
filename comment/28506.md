Thanks a lot, [@warren](/profile/warren) for the detailed review and points that I should consider in the proposal. 
And regarding the display issues, we can surely implement the functionality as it will make the UI much more cleaner, and also it would be easier to identify which all strings are leftover. Considering hover-over popover or tooltip beforehand and also with the help of tests covering the major scenarios, it can be made sure that the globe icon doesn't conflict with any other UI component.
