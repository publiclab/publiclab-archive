[@warren](/profile/warren)  [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) well that solves the summer's work problem mentioned in https://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc-ideas I guess. I'd like to work in this project, I'll start drafting a proposal for it after I clear myself with the ideas regarding sockets posted by [@namangupta](/profile/namangupta) in https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/2497.
