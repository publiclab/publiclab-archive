Just so this is recorded on this thread, here is my plan for moving forward: 
(1) Get information from the Kitagawa research team about co-contaminant tests they must have done during development of these tubes (note: thus far, my email probes have not been answered, but I will make a phone call today). 
(2) Try to expand our co-location study to at least n=30.  I have contacted the North Carolina State Laboratory of Public Health, and am hoping to hear back from them soon.  I plan to ask if they will be willing to provide us with the same generosity that the Rhode Island DOH/SHL folks did.  
(3) Do a literature search for more information regarding the performance of Kitagawa and Drager tubes. 
(4) Do a literature search for potential alternative low-cost formaldehyde detection methods. 
(5) If necessary, conduct chamber experiments with acetone, acetaldehyde, and perhaps other compounds like ammonia, ethyl acetate, and acetonitrile.
