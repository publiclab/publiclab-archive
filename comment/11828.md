The angle from which the photo is taken and the angle of the sun do influence the NDVI result. NDVI values are a function of how much red and NIR light are absorbed by leaves. At low angles, much light just reflects off the surface and chlorophyll does not have a chance to differentiate between red and NIR photons. Also, deep shadows are illuminated by light with a different color balance, so the proportion or red to NIR will differ from sunlit surfaces. As the day or the season progresses, the proportion and total amount of red and NIR entering the leaf changes, and the proportions reflected to a stationary camera will change fro multiple reasons.

Consumer cameras are not sensitive to thermal infrared, so that is not a problem. Some NIR is emitted from healthy plants by chlorophyll fluorescence, but it is trivial compared to the NIR reflected or scattered by leaves in sunlight.

Ebert is the name of a [particular version of the Public Lab spectrometer](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/2-19-2013/ebert). Above, a spectral transmission curve for the Rosco filter made by Ebert is compared to the transmission curve supplied by Rosco.
