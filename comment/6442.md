I ended up trying some semi-opaque plastic but indeed the light has to be really strong as a result: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-31-2013/modifications-and-tweaks-for-flare-spectrometry

Potentially you could use some kind of concentrator like a reflector from a lamp to get more light in there... just thinking out loud: http://www.amazon.com/Bayco-SL-300N4-Clamp-Aluminum-Reflector/dp/B007RKKEHA/
