The intensity is not an absolute measure - just a proportion of the dynamic range of the camera sensor. There are a few approaches to correcting for the gain compensation of a webcam, though: [#gain-correction](/tag/gain-correction) -- these should then be able to measure absolute light, though still not measured in lumens, per se -- there are other factors like distance and others that'd have to be considered. This might make a good independent question and I'm sure there are others in the community who'd be better able to answer the question!
