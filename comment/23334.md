Hello a1ahna, glad to meet you. Lest be in touch an talk about fungi bioremediation is a very important topic nowadays where everything is sustainability stretching more and more the materials. We need to start thinking about how to create bio-regenerative systems like mycoremediation.

It will be an honor for me to join you in the fungi book club.
