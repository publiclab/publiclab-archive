Hi, Cess - again, great proposal! I left a comment on https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-23-2018/call-for-outreachy-2018-19-proposals which I think could be useful -- about where, among models, controllers, and views, each part of the code you describe might go, and why:

> I think it would be great to see a few links to different areas of the existing codebase - to give a better sense of where these features and new code segments would be implemented, and how they relate to existing code. What would go into a model, a controller, a view? Are you familiar with the MVC model and how to break up code among these parts?

I hope this is helpful - i think it would increase the detail in the proposal and help advance the planning! Thanks again, Cess!
