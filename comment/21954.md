You can use a Pro Mini (or any other Arduino with an Atmel processor) to measure temperature  using only the mcu.  I think this is the best "No-Parts" temperature method I ever noodled around with:

['No-Parts' Temperature Measurement with Arduino Pro Mini ](https://thecavepearlproject.org/2019/02/25/no-parts-temperature-measurement-with-arduino-pro-mini-to-0-005c-or-better/)

This method generalizes to any other processor with a hardware driven watchdog timer, and should be easy to adapt for other projects here at PublicLab.
