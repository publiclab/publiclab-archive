[@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) & [@amocorro](/profile/amocorro)  - I was able to create a scheduled Python script that calls the API and returns the data on 10 minute intervals (_PurpleAir asks that we not make requests more frequent than that_). I am taking the response data and:

- parsing it into a three-dimensional hosted feature layer
- storing the response data in a table to use for historic or computational analysis

As the script iterates through the response values, there are ways we could extend it to push an alert/notification.
