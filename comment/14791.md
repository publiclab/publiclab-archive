[@stoft](/profile/stoft) hey dave, the comparison is really not so dissimilar, if you mean the spectral lines do not exactly match then yes, you are right. First, spekwin32, the software I use stretches the spectrum when I am working with it, Dr. Menges has not expained why, but it snaps back when another spectrum is added, but this is inconsequential.

Two, The Oregon Medical Laser Center is using a Fluorometer, a much more sophisticated piece of equipment, Dr. Menges has this center as a reference because it is the standard in the industry, and I need those spectra's as a reference when measuring quantum yields, it is very difficult to find spectral data on the internet that one can down load for free. 

Three, just because the spectral lines do not match exactly does not negate the validity of the data. I have had this data reviewed also on hackaday by others that have far more expierence than me, plus I am working with Dr.Menges on his project on hackaday as his bet tester, and he has reviewed many of my spectral work and has corrected errors on my part.

Four, I do not know, and it is not stated in the literature the chemical preparations done for the fluorescein sample tested. So I used an industry standard solution of fluorescein that I made ( I have posted several times how I did this and all the details) and diluted the sample to that of Lange's Handbook of Chemistry Section 4.14 thru 4.178 and my own research and analysis using different dilute sample.

All this beign said, I have posted research notes before on this very comparison with the spectral graphs separated, one showing the OMLC's fluorescein sample and mine, using this very spectrometer. 

Five, My fluorescein may be slightly chemically different from their  (OMLC's) fluorescein sample, that will make a slight difference.

Finally, I am using a DVD piece as my diffraction grating, it is 4.7g at 1,351 lines per mm, the slit is an acetate "film" which I tried to make as straight as possible but probably has it's own imperfections also, the cuvettes I use are superior, semi-micro UV plastic made from a polycyclic material and does have an absorption of less than 0.1. again though, it probably has it's own microscopic imperfections that may cause slight distortions, taking all these factors into account I think that my data is pretty remarkable in that I am using a home built kit, that's the whole point dave, it's a comparison on accuracy and precision, 9nm is really not THAT far off, especially since I am not even using any type of filter, ie,. a Notch filter or Bandpass filter for the laser.  

I'd like just a little respect, that's all.

Thanks Dave H
