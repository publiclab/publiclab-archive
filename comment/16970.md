Thanks for adding a photo. NDVI is based on the assumption that the light illuminating the foliage has a certain proportion of NIR and VIS -- the proportion that is in sunlight (e.g., satellite photos don't show vegetation when it is cloudy, so satellite NDVI exists only when direct sunlight illuminates the foliage). So taking photos outside will be more useful for troubleshooting. 

If your project will be using artificial lighting, then your NDVI system might have to be calibrated for the particular proportion of NIR and VIS in those lights. Also, fluorescent lamps do not produce much NIR, so you can't really do NDVI under some indoor lighting.

Photographic exposure is very important for computing NDVI. Both the VIS and the NIR channels should be well exposed with most of the areas of foliage neither over or under exposed.
