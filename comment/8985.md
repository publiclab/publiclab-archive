This is an 1865 map of the Prospect Park study area:

It shows the original springs of Prospect Park prior to regrading under the Olmstead & Vaux landscaping plan.  Kite mapping of current grass growth patterns and surviving spring upwellings would try to give a higher resolution understanding of how the Park's hydrology has changed over time.

If it turns out the springs were diverted and drained into the Prospect Park West combined sewer system, these clean water springs would be (unnecessarily) contributing to combined sewer overflows in the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site. Such a discovery would allow a discussion to begin about the restoration of the historical wetlands of Prospect Park.

A good 1860 view, looking from the Brooklyn Public Library across Park Slope towards Gowanus Creek, showing these historic wetlands can be found here:
