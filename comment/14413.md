Great post! I love how you so clearly stated some of the conclusions. 

A few thoughts:

* maybe I missed this, but to [@viechdokter](/profile/viechdokter)'s comment, are there some pixels which are consistently noisier? That may be hard to separate from the fact that each pixel is being "exposed" to only a narrow wavelength of light. 
* I love your graphs. One thing I thought of was that if the lines were displayed with 10-20% opacity, we might be able to see the amount of overlap more clearly -- that is, data behind wouldn't be obscured by data in front. Not sure if that's something Matlab can do?
* I was also curious about another way to present data -- drawing the graph lines at 90 degrees, so that we see a line indicating variability of scans of a single wavelength, instead of variability over time. We do see that in this graph:

![graph1](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/693/large/STest_CFL-91pt2700K535-555nm.gif)

But if we saw the same data, but the lines were connecting points as in this graph instead:

![graph2](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/694/large/STest_CFL-91pt2700K545-6-7nm.gif)

we'd see a series of time graphs per wavelength for the whole spectrum. Just curious!

Thanks, Dave, my biggest takeaway for this note was your point that since noise is truly uncorrelated (dare I say random, maybe not), subtracting black noise from the whole spectrum won't work.
