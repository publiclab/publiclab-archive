The differential reflection in the red and infrared (IR) bands enables you to monitor density and intensity of green vegetation growth using the spectral reflectivity of solar radiation. Green leaves commonly show better reflection in the near-infrared wavelength range than in visible wavelength ranges. When leaves are water stressed, diseased, or dead, they become more yellow and reflect significantly less in the near-infrared range. Clouds, water, and snow show better reflection in the visible range than in the near-infrared range, while the difference is almost zero for rock and bare soil. The NDVI process creates a single-band dataset that mainly represents greenery. The negative values represent clouds, water, and snow, and values near zero represent rock and bare soil. for more read http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.3/index.cfm?TopicName=Using_the_NDVI_process
