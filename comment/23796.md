   Hi, please upload your proposal at the Google Summer of Code website at the earliest. Please ignore this comment if already done.

Please don't worry about the reviewal. Me or Jeff will do it at the earliest. We have time before the final selections. So, we can suggest changes in the comments and suggest more enhancements in the comments section at your proposal. But its much more important to submit the proposals at the GSoC website at the earliest.
