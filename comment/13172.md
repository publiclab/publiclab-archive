[@schroyer](/profile/schroyer) Putting together my own DustDuino now and heads up, the personal Xively data hosting is buggy as all hell now. Can't even get past creating a development device without getting a general Internal Server Error. I'm guessing they're maybe phasing out non-enterprise accounts? 

I'm looking at some of the other data stream hosting options now. Any opinions before I go and start altering code?
