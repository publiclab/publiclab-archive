It's often quite easy to access the IR block filter on this type of little camera. In this case you might have to also dismantle the UAV just to get to the camera. Sometimes it's easy to remove the IR filter, but sometimes it is glued in and harder to remove. Little CMOS cameras like this don't seem to work very well with a blue filter, so a red filter is a better choice.  It might be that the camera is setup to take video only, so taking stills might not be possible, so blurry frame grabs would be required. The camera is pointed forward, so taking vertical air photos would require moving it.  Images from the 0.3 MP camera might not allow much detailed analysis of vegetation patterns either before or after modifying it.
