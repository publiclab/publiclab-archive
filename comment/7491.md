Jeff, nice experiment. Yes, UV is the right choice -- the shorter the wavelength the better.
I'm assuming that the UV-light 'reference' was with water and the oil tests were with some small amount added to the water. Right? What is interesting is the dramatic drop in the UV carrier signal. This would make quantitative measurements difficult. At least there appears to be sufficient signal outside of the UV carrier signature. -Dave
