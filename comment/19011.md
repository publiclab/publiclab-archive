Yes [@icarto](/profile/icarto), we need to add redis to our deployment. Redis is required for most of the 3rd party queuing libraries (e.g resque, sidekiq, etc). As an alternative to resque we could use delayed_job ( although resque is a far better option if we have larger amount of async jobs at a time).
Capistrano is an optional utility to automate deployment. So it's our choice if we use it in our app. It's just that everytime we need to restart our servers we need to run a resque command along (rake resque:work). In my demo app I haven't used Capistrano and it works fine.
Please correct me if I am wrong and kindly give your feedback on this.
