Plastics in the Gut

Today we discussed how even boiling our water can not rid it of microplastics. Since plastic has been invented, the production has only exponentially increased. In 2018, a study determined that on average the human adult consumes 32,000 pieces of microplastics a year. We discussed in class the reality that cleaning our water and then drinking it out of plastic water bottles is nearly defeating the purpose and simply just exposing the water to more contaminants. The reality is that plastics are now everywhere. Classified as legacy pollutants, plastics are in our clothes, in our water, in our food, on our bodies, and in our bodies. The way in which our world functions today is impossible without plastics, which is why even now as we are aware of its adverse affects we will continue to use it.
