Increasing dynamic range will go a long way in improving NDVI results in the shadows. There are some high-dynamic-range image processing methods that combine multiple images acquired at different exposures and the results look stunning. I haven't tried it but it looks like it would be a lot of work without a decent work-flow. I also might be tough to get good results with moving cameras. Maybe that could be another ImageJ plugin but I'm not sure there is much interest. Some cameras have a broad dynamic range but it would be tough to beat what you can get by combining multiple exposures.
