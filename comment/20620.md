Thx [@warren](/profile/warren) and [@tech4gt](/profile/tech4gt) !!! I was able to use the import image step and have moved on to the colorbar step.  The chart below compares the different image sequencer colormap/bars. The ([@fastie](/profile/fastie)) Fastie colorbar from (  https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/08-26-2014/new-ndvi-colormap#12/37.8950/-122.1230 ) was also posted  for reference.   Please let me know if I am doing anything wrong.
