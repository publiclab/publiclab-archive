I found this:  http://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/col-bta/
which is interesting because unlike other low-cost spectrometers/colorimeters its specification claims to be measuring 4 different wavelengths (430 nm, 470 nm, 565 nm, 635 nm) instead of the usual 3 (RGB).  Anyone know or might guess what sensor/approach it's using?  Perhaps it doesn't have the wavelength overlaps that confound the output of typical RGB sensors.

For that matter, is there an inexpensive off-the-shelf  RGB sensor which has none of the confounding wavelength overlap?

Failing that, what about pin diodes?  Any inexpensive COTS units which are highly selective and no overlap in their detected wavelengths?  Anyone happen to know?  I tried scanning through the offerings on digikey, but their parametric search engine seems too primitive to create a shortlist of candidates.  I found it to be a bit like searching for a few "good enough" needles in a haystack of needles, without knowing in advance whether any of them are actually good enough to create a non-confounding complement.
