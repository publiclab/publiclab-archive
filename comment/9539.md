great workshop, really well run and I loved reading about the glitches along the way :)

Now you have a prototype working, the next step would be to lose the breadboard and get some PCBs made with enough pinouts so you can package the thing up in a box, with some flexibility. 

I'm thinking this would be a great project for one of my classes. Fine tuning the resistors to get a nice frequency audio tone would be the key. 10uF and 20k Ohms giving a 1.5Hz blink rate is good for visual, what values did you find best for the audio ?

Great thinking using Audacity as a frequency counter :)

thanks for taking the time to write up an excellent research note, well done, I can feel the enthusiasm from here !
