Hi Ned,
We have the data in pretty good shape in a Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj92oPqI2WPMdFQ3Y1k2bVExNmpLbTRwNkEyWmxkckE#gid=0
Other tabs in that spreadsheet include the GPS data (lat, long, alt) which has been matched up with the temperature and pressure from the Jeenode.  The accelerometer data have not been matched yet.  There is no time stamp on the Jeenode data, and it was recording points 2 to 2.5 times more frequently than the GPS watch, so I did some crude visual matching of GPS elevation and Jeenode pressure to synchronize the data.

Using GIS to visualize these data is a good idea.  I could not figure out how to make a KML file that colors each path segment or point as a function of temperature.  So displaying such data in Google Earth might require simplification, as I did above. I was hoping to get it done in Google Earth because that is a good way to share the data and allow others to extend the analysis.
