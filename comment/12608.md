JorgeV,

The process is very sensitive to both the color balance and exposure of each photo. If the grass in your photos was a little less bright and a little more turquoise, the NDVI values would be higher.

It helps us to have an actual photo from your camera (maybe reduced in size) for testing. Just drag it into a research note or comment.

The color key has to be added manually after Fiji makes an NDVI image. You can download that key image here: <http://publiclab.org/wiki/photo-monitoring-plugin>. A quicker method is to select `Image/Color/Show LUT` in Fiji when your NDVI image is displayed then resize and drag the window to overlay the color gradient at the edge of the NDVI image. Then capture and crop a screenshot.
