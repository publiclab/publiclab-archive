Hi, all - some followups via Scott Eustis of Gulf Restoration Network -- [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic):

Re: imagery, Department of Homeland Security NOAA flights -- scott has a link? they respond to hurricanes

Scott mentioned msu/msc? reports that are already being submitted, and skytruth gets a copy of these, perhaps a source for the Coast Guard requested info...

Re: Willow's contacts, is this houston/galveston coast guard?

Notes the `#harveyrecovery` hashtag

concern for other industrial centers that we haven't heard from -- is no news good news? ...

Thanks, all!
