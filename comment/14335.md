My guess is that the wavelength transmission curve of the glass (depending on type) softly "rolls off" for shorter wavelengths -- i.e. the glass is probably not a 'flat' transmission response. There is probably a low pass filtering effect from the polarization coating on the glass. Ideally, what you'd need is a neutral density filter which has the transmission curve specified to at least cover the spectrometers 400nm end. A cheap-and-pretty-good attenuator can be made by printing diffuse 'neutral-grey-density' patterns on sheet inkjet-printable film. They are not terribly flat but work for relative measurements.
