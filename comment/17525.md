Hi Sophia, 
I had a chance to show Scott in person last week, and here's what he said: 

* it's great
* use fullsize images
* link back to where the images originally came from (in this case, flickr folder) at the end
* in the survey, the question for performance "flipped" the scale so that "good" is on the left, unlike the scale on the other questions
* on the heat map, try another color besides green to indicate where the oil is. 

Thanks!
