There's also the environmental resources guides page, can these wiki's be combined or synthesized?
https://publiclab.org/wiki/enviro-guide-resources

Tulane Environmental Law Guide  "My Guide"  has much of these topics covered, along with sample letters

GRN's comment page:

The Scraper project is dormant for now, but if you have money to run this again, i'm all ears:
