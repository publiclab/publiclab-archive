Here are neat instructions on constructing a turbidity tube by Elizabeth Myre & Ryan Shaw:: http://www.virginia.edu/blandy/blandy_web/education/Bay/TurbidityTubeConstruction&Use_Myre_Shaw.pdf 

GLOBE also has a turbidity tube construction notes here: https://www.gvsu.edu/wri/education/instructors-manual-turbidity-10.htm

I've also posted [a new question here on the tube method verses other methods for observing turbidity](https://publiclab.org/questions/stevie/03-21-2018/how-do-i-choose-a-method-for-monitoring-turbidity).
