Ned, thank you for your tremendous effort in this field.  I have been following your work here and reviewing Geert Verhoeven's previous research very closely. I am a graduate researcher at Oregon State University and calibration of Canon cameras converted for NIR sensitivity is highly desirable for my research. I have several converted cameras: Canon G15 (590 nm filter), S100 (830 nm filter) and Sony NEX 5T (665 nm filter).  I soon will be adding a NEX 5T with 590 nm and a S110 with 590 nm filters.  I have unmodified duplicates of most of these cameras.  I would like to offer my assistance toward your objective of producing a simplified calibration workflow and calibration cards. I may also have access to the spectroscopy lab on campus if necessary. If you are interested let me know.
