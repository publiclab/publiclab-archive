[@sarasage](/profile/sarasage) To make sure I am understanding your current configuration - You have handheld air quality monitors that log the results on the data logger, do not have do not have GPS, and currently rely on a separate application the needs an active cellular connection for entering the data.

A couple clarifying questions:
* Do the data loggers have a way to connect to another device? - i.e. Bluetooth, USB, etc.
* How are results currently logged and accessed? (Are they being stored to a file and transferred to another device? Are you manually entering the air quality results into another application?)
