 Dear DanielleS. I'm a software developer, retired but still active with code writing, developing  analytics for natural resource management. We just had a major incident  at the Brumadinho iron mining  dam in State Minas Gerais Brazil, which might cause some of the worst environmental disasters, we've ever seen. I'm doing research how to create a basic monitoring device, possibly based on spectrophotometer to detect traces of contaminants, mainly the heavy metal elements in river water, or soil. Avoiding reagents would be great, as it helps to automate the measurement without need for human intervention, or expensive laboratory assistance. Not sure yet, if this will be possible, for now its just a line of thoughts and research. I'm happy to exchange ideas about this techniques, also for soil measurement, as there is  growing market for such type of monitoring.  Regards, Claude (Brazil)
