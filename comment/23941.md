And just linking to here, where the wiki page documents the 2 channels, which i would guess are from the 2 sensors? https://publiclab.org/wiki/purpleair#Other+things+to+know+about+using+your+Purple+Air

> PA-II includes two laser sensors. An unknown algorithm estimates particulate concentration. I wouldnâ€™t exclude further processing by PurpleAir, maybe matching against an accuracy estimate obtained correlating nearby certified sensors where available. This before finally making PM2.5 averages available on the map and through JSON API.
