RE:Any Radio?
 Wow! I had no idea!  That could definitely be really useful if you already have compatible equipment for another purpose

RE:OpenCPN-
  As my 21 day trial period has expired for ShipPlotter, I've been working with OpenCPN a lot lately.  The most common method seems to output the signal from SDR# to OpenCPN via AISMon but I can't get AISMon to pick up the packets, even though I can see them in SDR#...

 RE:Antenna
   I have a wide ranging (25-300MHz) scanner antenna that I've been using.  However, considering the unique geography of the Maine coastline, I'm thinking a directional antenna might be a better bet.  I have some visuals showing my FOV from my house that I'll add to the note above...

  RE: Tinkering Deeper-
   I can't help but to wonder if there's a simpler solution to the rather convoluted workflow in its current form (i.e decoding the analog signal via the PC soundcard etc...).  Especially since something as lightweight as OpenWRT supports RTL-SDR packages and can run GPSD...  I recently started a new thread at http://www.rtl-sdr.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=338&p=867#p867 examining the potential for using the Arduino Yun to simplify the workflow.  One of the possibilities I propose is to use the Linux side of the Yun as the AIS decoder and the Arduino side as an [electronically tunable antenna](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=240131.0)!  The immediate problem being that this method only reaches bands as low as 700MHz and AIS is 162MHz...
