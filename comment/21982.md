Hi, I am Kunal Vaswani, I have contributed in Public Labs previously.
Here is my github handle: https://github.com/kunalvaswani123
I have good enough experience in ruby, javascript, html, css. I would be helpful for ideas in https://github.com/publiclab/plots2. I am particularly interested in Sensor data upload and display library. I have worked with js libraries like chart.js required for this idea. Is anyone already working on it? if not I'd like to share some of my ideas for this project. Thanks
