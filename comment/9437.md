Hank Boschen's Dylos monitoring system in Chippewa Falls records readings from a Dylos every 10 minutes and posts to a website. It also includes weather data from the Eau Claire-Chippewa Falls regional airport. Why not talk to him and find out how his system is set-up? Matthew's post on frac sand  has an image of a typical graph. It should be simple to find a temp-humidity logger if you wanted local values. Try Onset data Loggers. Why try to reinvent?
