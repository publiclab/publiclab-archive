I was able to manually  upload a cfl spectrum image.  But Opera on android (Nexus 10) does not cooperate very well.  To select the file to upload, we do not get to see a thumbnail or preview, so I have to find the file name by other means.  Then when we navigate to the find, if we choose an incorrect path (fat finger), we cannot back out. I have to exit the browser and start over. 

Ok, once I have the image uploaded, I can see it on the website from my PC.   BUT the image is different from expected.  It is very narrow, different from other examples.  Also, I cannot do the calibration step.  This is windows XP running firefox. 

Does this also require switching to opera or chrome on the PC as well?  

I wish to avoid unnecessary software, or to be forced to change browsers.
