Hi!
Updates made on the 80% pointers given in comments above, mainly;

* Added a date tag to the email subject, because I realized all photos, regardless of when the photo(s) were taken, go to the same email thread, so adding the date tag will have photos taken on different days on different email strings, probably help with email sorting
* Formatted the latitude and longitude values sent to your email address
* Better in-app notifications, like, where the photos are saved on your phone and infor on how to redirect to the "Guide" menu whenever something is too technical or not so clear

Next,

* Merging code so that the "source code" link to go https://github.com/publiclab/sky-camera
* Notification if photo was saved or discarded depending on if or not it's blur

New research note coming up, fully on the User Guide for SkyCam.

Give [SkyCam a new test run again here](https://github.com/mercyorangi/sky-camera/blob/branch2/bin/Sky%20Cam.apk), and I definitely do appreciate more feedback coming along :-)
