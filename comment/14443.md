Super duper, thanks Gretchen! Great ideas.

I'll respond to the Rich Editor one for now, since design for that has begun:

> Can we power-tag research notes to help streamline a single research project with many notes?

Yes, that's a good idea. I was thinking something like:

* On post form: "Mark this as a part of a series of notes" (generates `series:<topicname>` tag)
* On note page: "This is part X of Y in a series on Z" -- maybe with navigation to go through all notes on this project over time
