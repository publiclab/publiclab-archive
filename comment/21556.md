 Thanks Stray'.  Actually, the 0.06 A  for the wine was at 5 cm path.  Divide by 5 to get 1 cm path for comparison.

If yeast/fermentation was contributing to the increase, I think the effect would increase with time.  Re-tested the samples that had been sitting around for a few days, and there was no change from the original tests.

Anthocyanins sounds interesting.  So, if I tried the experiment with a white wine, the absorbance increase should go away?  Great, maybe we've found a spectroscopic method to differentiate between red and white wine :)

To actually detect sugar requires looking at absorbance in the 210 - 270 nm range, outside the range of this 'meter.  On the other hand, creating the tools to perform these tests is interesting.  It's the journey, not the destination.
