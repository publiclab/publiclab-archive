Follow up: [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet), in exploring export options for a different project, I just discovered that you can extract the visual attributes (i.e. color, size, positions) by exporting to one of the files that supports this (see matrix image [here](https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/)).  Open the .gephi file, then go to File --> Export --> Graph File.  When you choose a supported file format, the "Options" button should become "clickable".  Click on it, and make sure to check off the boxes for any attributes you'd like.

Personally, since I do have an interest in web visualizations, but I do not have an interest in figuring out how to implement algorithms for things like community detection and calculating node sizes, I think this is a great way to quickly translate the static visualizations from gephi into something dynamic.  The other plus is that I'd prefer to see changes I made update in real time without having re-run the program again.

Again, for all others, we'll get some files up real soon!
