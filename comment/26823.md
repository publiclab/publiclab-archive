I often use an orange-red filter, handheld in from of the camera, from a scrapped enlarger. I do a white balance with the eye dropper tool in PS, Gimp or Lightzone, and swap the red and blue channel (plenty instructions on youtube)  The orange filter allows some more color variety.

The cyan filter basically just swaps the red with IR, and allows all other colors to pass.
