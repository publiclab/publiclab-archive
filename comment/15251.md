This is awesome, Chris! Thanks for the great feedback!

It seems I missed the nylon washers for the vinyl tube clamp for the silly putty mechanism. I may have been thinking you could use a hex nut instead, but forgot to include that in the diagrams. Either way I think a [#6](/n/6) nylon washer is best suited there.

I tried to specify which size nylon tube clamp to use for each part as they're pretty close in size, but I guess that could be better specified. Maybe if I designate one type (1/4" ID) for use with the dowels and the other (5/16" ID) for use with the tubing that would be easier to follow?

For the pendulum, I was also thinking a thicker gauge wire might be better suited, although I did like how easy the 14 gauge was to bend by hand.

I'm also not sure the short dowel and nylon hose clamp are necessary at the top, they are remnants from some earlier iterations and were included in the kit as an added safety in the unlikely case that the tubing were to tear.

Securing the pendulum shaft is definitely an issue that needs to be addressed, I solved it on some flight tests by wrapping a rubber band around the shaft and the laser cut plate, although it would be nicer if there were a cleaner way of securing it.

The rubber o-rings do prevent the plates from slipping off of the dowels when pushed tightly against the plates, although they may be prone to a bit of slipping with some rough turbulence in flight.
