I agree with Chris. Narrower bands, when they are optimally centered, logically will work better, particularly because - virtually inherent with interference filters - they will therefore also have steeper cut-on and cut-off slopes. Not only do the above-mentioned (or any) absorptive filters have very wide bands, their cut-on and cut-off slopes are very gradual. Very broad passbands together with gentle (lazy?) slopes translate into much poorer contrast/definition. Another factor is where you will be mounting any interference-type filter. Most consumer cameras have fairly short focal length (wide angle) lenses. Particularly if the lens focal length is, say, anything under 8mm, an interference-type filter mounted on the front of the lens will be subject to significant short-shifting - especially out toward the edges of the image - imposed on the filter by the angular field of view of the lens. If you will be doing this, it's probably best that the passband(s) be centered a little on the longer side of your desired nominal. Better still will be if you can mount the filter behind the lens/directly in front of the sensor. Something on the order of 0.5 - 1.0mm overall filter thickness would probably be best in that case. The angular shifting phenomena should then not be an issue.

MAPIR (mapir.camera) offers various lenses with a host of different single and dual-band filter options. The filters are generally mounted at the back of their lenses. Midwest Optical Systems (midopt.com) offers various stock single and dual band filters either in mounts or custom cut/sized to suit any lens or camera.
