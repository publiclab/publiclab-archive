I'd agree with [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) that building awareness of what information data contains, and what information it does not contain, is of primary importance. While there are specific examples, learning how to ask the right questions may be more important because "data" can take so many forms and formats. So my $.02 is to focus on what questions to ask and then use specific examples showing how those question perform in the real world. Learning this is a very useful tool as it promotes thinking "in advance" -- i.e. IF I could get the following data, would it be useful? and How detailed / accurate would my data need to be to be meaningful?
