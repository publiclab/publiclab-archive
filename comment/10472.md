We had a truly terrible experience working with and ordering from SYBA, and one reason we moved to a different camera was to find a company which was easier to work with. So if you do a webcam search, I'd encourage you to look elsewhere -- and please do share what you find, since we're also sourcing new cameras for the Homebrew Oil Testing Kit! (I'm sure [@natalie](/profile/natalie) would be very happy to share notes, too, as she's doing a lot of our sourcing!)
