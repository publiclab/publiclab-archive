Before the trip, we utilized the Marine Debris Tracker to find debris lying in the ditch. We created microscopes using plastic sheets, metal parts, screws, washers, and rubber-bands. This would be utilized to analyze our microplastics we collected the day before and find particles on the specimens. Pre-trip we carried sticks to attach to our Babylegs for extra reach and safety precautions.
