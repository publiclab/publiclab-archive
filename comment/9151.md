I think image selection and show/hide toggles are a good starting point. Other options could be in a dropdown menu as Jeff mention, maybe leave room for one more direct option like lock.

Using the whole map as a drop region is probably fine.  I don't see the problem. good point on novice users.

The ordering issue does come up-- i don't always want to edit an image that automatically pops to the top-- sometimes I want to edit an image while it is below (selection currently brings it to the front) and the small/large image calculation is imperfect. I think its a case where user control is more straightforward than automatic placement.
