Yes, maybe ask Shannon about the budget. The QR code just points at wherewebreathe.org/qr - we can hook that up later to redirect anywhere we like. 

Good question about yellow/pink - one way to do it would just be to print very clear red and yellow in a very consistent pigment which is fade-proof. [@mathew](/profile/mathew), do you have an idea for this based on what we've done for the Infragram card? I guess a fade-proof ink may be best; should we ask Charles?
