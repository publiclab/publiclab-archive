This is awesome, Justin!
I'm excited about the code maintainability work you're doing, that is important to our future additions.

In terms of adding Riffle data, it my initial thought is we could treat it like embed content.  We already have a goal of getting video and other rich media embeds on the maps, so would -- Dare i say it within earshot of [@btbonval](/profile/btbonval) -- iframe embedding ala youtube be the way to go?
