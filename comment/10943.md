Is it necessary to isolate the yeast in order to use it for brewing? During the fermentation process, more than one species of microbe could be present, but only one or a few dominate for the important period. Many traditional fermented and cultured foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi, and yogurt are routinely made without sterile equipment or procedures. Sourdough bread is made with cultures that resist invasion by harmful microbes for months without depending on laboratory conditions. Maybe finding a strain that can compete with other microbes is as important as eliminating  all other microbes.
