Ok, your comments help.

- On the cuvettes and laser orientation for fluorescence: Frosted surfaces might be an issue. I found that with the PLab cuvettes, orientation matters. They have a 'narrow' rectangular chamber which I used to advantage. The laser beam is oriented to be centered on the narrow dimension and the clear surface at 90 deg reduces the reflections and scattering within the cuvette acrylic material. The spectrometer is thus 'looking' at the broad, flat cuvette side where the laser beam is in-line parallel to the slit. The spectrometer is a 'long' device where the only photons to arrive at the camera are those from the random fluorescence within the fluid which happen to be emitted in the right direction (or luckily so after some reflection). Adding a frosted surface can only add dimensionless scattering which, I suspect, could decrease the amount of fluorescent light reaching the camera. I agree, it does require careful alignment which is why I found mechanical stability beneficial.

- Yes, the different oils of the OTK do have very different fluorescence intensities. For a simple configuration setup test, using the laser at 90 deg with careful alignment, you might try a 5-10% solution of liquid laundry detergent. The HD sample I tried had a very strong fluorescense signature so might make an easy test with a strong spectra to observe -- just to get a handle on optimizing your setup. My initial tests with the V3 spectrometer and OTK beta, as shipped, were very difficult for observing any fluorescence at all. My prototype was just my method for obtaining a solid reference configuration for comparative observations. So, I think it might help with your experiments to resolve the fluroescence observations first so you have a reference configuration for other comparisons. (Though, I recognize that direct observations of LED and laser excitation signals probably requires a different configuration -- though that too has the same demands for stability.
