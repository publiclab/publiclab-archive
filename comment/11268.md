[@Ecta64](/profile/Ecta64), thanks for your thoughts! I definitely think just being more careful with the actual operation of the knob that adjusts the camera angle (it was only my second time flying the Phantom) will help, and then post processing to remove the fisheye effect seems a more likely strategy for me than attaching a secondary camera. I'll be taking it out this weekend and will see how things look on a different landscape (perhaps with a marker as you suggest) and check out the various post processing options.
