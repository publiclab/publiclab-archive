Finally got something working using the ic-Haus LFL1402 diode array.
https://www.ichaus.de/iC-LFL1402
I normally use 3 V (2xAA bateries) so I had to use a step-up for the diode array (NCP1402 50T1).
I am using a bigger display (3" 400x240) it is also faster as it uses parallel communication  It was obtained from DX.com (open smart).
Below is the test spectrum of didymium glass

and this is the menu screen

Notice the green asterix by the USB transfer indicating that the USB cable is attached. I have decided to use usb rather than SD cards this time (as SD cards turned out to be very difficult due to the number of different types). The spectrometer can store up to 24 spectra in flash which can be transfered by the usb link (using a FT201X I2C to USB chip).
The optics are a bit more involved as there is collimation onto the sample holder, followed by focusing onto a slit then further collimation onto the diffraction grating then re-focused onto the diode array. It gets much better throughput, but is very tricky to allign.
