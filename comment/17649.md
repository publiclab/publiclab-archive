Although there are sensors that require more than 3.3V, most of the simple DIY sensors are designed to use 3.3V. For example, [all of the sensors here](http://kaptery.com/product/addon-sensors-etc) can use 3.3V, and some can use either 3.3V or 5V.

It is a common design decision to use only 3.3V and allows better longevity on battery power. This is also a characteristic of the Arduino Pro Mini, several other Arduinos, and the Adafruit Feather boards.
