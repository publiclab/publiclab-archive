Would TROPOMI (TROPospheric Ozone Monitoring Instrument) http://www.tropomi.eu/ be a satellite that data could be pulled down from in this way? Accessing these images right from these census tracks covered in this story about [#houston](/tag/houston) would be a powerful public science action: https://cen.acs.org/environment/pollution/Satellites-see-air-pollution-inequality/98/web/2020/08 ...
