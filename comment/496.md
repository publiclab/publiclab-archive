It's great to see progress on the dual timer! I showed this to my son (age 12) and told him the goal was to repeatedly trigger two things simultaneously.  He walked over to his computer and in a few minutes built it in Minecraft. So everybody is way ahead of me in circuitry.

Can you include two output ports (to the two cameras) on the board or will you split the signal with a Y cable?
