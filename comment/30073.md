Hi [@Thekachi](/profile/Thekachi), thank you for your proposal! I love your redesign of the front page. Great separation of sections and purposes. I really like the idea of drag and drop from the front page! I am a little cautious, however -- how do we achieve it? If we change URL then we lose the image that's been dragged, since we're not really uploading it. Can we... store it in localStorage temporarily? It's a little bit involved, but possible. 

The floating tools pane you've shown is interesting and has some advantages. But I worry that the "edit" icon is not clear enough as a first step. Do you think first-time users will be confused as to what to do? I love your flow chart of workflow analysis and maybe this possible ambiguity could be factored in -- is the tool pane open automatically? If so, does it need the icon at all, or could it be always open? 

Thank you very much!
