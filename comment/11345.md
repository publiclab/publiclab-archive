Hi I have set up my own rig with a chdk camera taped to an aluminum roof-rake. I ran the pictures through Agisoft Photoscan Pro and got he following orthophoto as a result of my garden: https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5590/14678236891_247042ba7a_o.jpg

I know that this might not be the best place to share (a how to of building a pole), but I just wanted to let people know what kind of results they can get. It has high enough resolution that you can id the types of vegetables. If I were to add some gps control I could use the accompanying 3d point coud to calculate micro drainages.
