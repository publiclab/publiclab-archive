This data /value are Analog values:
 -With he open air, after sensor warms up for ~1 minute: 52 
-breathing slowly over the sensor for several seconds: 73 
-holding sensor directly over an open bottle of grain alcohol: 235 
-inside the washroom post pee/use of cleaning products: 450-600

For measuring in ppm the range of concentration as per datasheet is 1-30ppm and >10ppm indicates Unsafe. 

Welcome [@warren](/profile/warren) . Your past Prototypes were worth testing. 

Right now TGS825 is not for scale if I am right.
