Hi [@priyaraj_17](/profile/priyaraj_17) thank you for your changes! Much appreciated. I wanted to point to this on the autocompletion task: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/7526 because we've recently expanded it to the rich editor and this pull request includes some specific code additions that show how it fetches and formats responses from the server. 

Additionally, this may be helpful -- for the dashboard, we are looking to make only relatively small tweaks and refinements, and not a complete overhaul of the design. For example, one thing that came up is that people would like to see more images in their feed. How might that look? 

Thank you for your interest!!!!
