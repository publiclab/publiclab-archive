This is really killer. Thanks Justin. If we get this done along with the other MapKnitter Leaflet proposal, we're going to be adding some amazing new features to Leaflet!

One thing to consider is that the other Leaflet proposal by Anish may mean that we'll no longer have a "viewing" interface in Leaflet with an "editing" interface in OpenLayers. The two could be the same -- exciting! So you may have to coordinate how a user switches between the "annotate" and "stitching" toolsets... and coordinate to be sure the interfaces are consistent (read: lots of bootstrap!)

Super.
