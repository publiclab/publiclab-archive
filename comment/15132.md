Right, that should be inlcuded in the readme.

Yes, echoCancellation is disabled at quiet.js: https://github.com/quiet/quiet-js/blob/master/quiet.js#L358
Turning it off also disables other filters, which is important to get the full and unfiltered spectrum of the captured signal. E.g. ultrasonic signals will be filtered, if echoCancellation is turned on.
