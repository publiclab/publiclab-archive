Hi [@bkleist](/profile/bkleist) 
Thanks for posting on this! I know of a few other people who are interested in using cameras to watch for blasting events. So I'm really excited to watch this play out! I did see this research note about using a [light fixture for housing](https://publiclab.org/notes/tonyc/07-01-2016/mobius-trapcam-housing), but I'm not sure how well this field tested. 

Also, there is an interesting thread about [visual emissions reporting](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/publiclab-midwest/ZSFA7apwLE8) and how there is a method for using cameras for this I know [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) has been looking into. 

If something with the mobius doesn't work out, [game cameras are coming down in price and might work!](http://www.cabelas.com/product/cabela-s-outfitter-14mp-ir-hd-trail-camera/2287582.uts?Ntk=AllProducts&searchPath=%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch%2F%3FN%3D10000051%26Ne%3D10000051%26Ntk%3DAllProducts%26Ntt%3Dtrailcam%26Ntx%3Dmode%252Bmatchallpartial%26WTz_l%3DHeader%253BSearch-All%252BProducts%26WTz_st%3DSearchRefinements%26form_state%3DsearchForm%26search%3Dtrailcam%26searchTypeByFilter%3DTopRated%26x%3D10%26y%3D6&Ntt=trailcam)
