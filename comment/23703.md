Hi jeffalk,

Thanks for pointing out that the PM10 index includes all particles smaller than 10µm. If that is true, you are correct that PM10 should never be smaller than PM2.5 or PM1.0. 

You are also correct that the difference between PM10 and PM2.5 is not constant. However, the proportional relationship among the three indices, although not perfectly constant, does not vary much and varies in a predictable way.

*Figure 1. Upper: An eight hour period of data collection showing three particulate indices (part of "Figure 10" linked above). Lower: the relationship (ratios) between the indices in the upper graph. The value of PM10 is about 1.1 times larger than the value of PM2.5, and the value of PM10 is about 1.7 time larger than the value of PM1.0. The ratios vary as a function of the magnitude of the PM indices (when the indices are larger, the ratios are larger).*

*Figure 2. Scatterplot showing the relationship between PM2.5 and PM10 for the data in Figure 1. Linear regression indicates a strong association between these two indices. The correlation coefficient for these indices is also high (r=0.93).* 

These three indices estimated by the Plantower sensor are highly correlated. This is consistent with the idea that all of the parameters output by the sensor are derived from a single set of laser scattering measurements. The equation used to derive each parameter apparently starts with the same set of measurements. 

The actual concentrations of 10µm and 2.5µm particles in air might be correlated in many air samples. The high correlation presented here (Figure 2) might be unrealistic for samples of natural air and more likely to be an artifact of the math used to derive the estimates.
 
The correlation shown above is not perfect possibly because additional information is used (there are parameters in the equations other than the scattering measurements) or because some scattering measurements are weighted differently (e.g., depending on the magnitude of other scattering measurements).

The message is that the Plantower sensor apparently uses the same set of equations to estimate 12 different indices of particulate matter regardless of the characteristics of that particulate matter (shape, composition, density, size distribution, color, temperature, humidity). 

Meaningful interpretations of the output of the sensor benefit from some appreciation for how the sensor works and how the software derives the output. For example, for a range of laser scattering measurements the equations probably produce non-zero values for all of the indices. So for a sample of air with only PM1.0 particles, an erroneous value might be output for PM10 (e.g., about 1.7 times larger than PM1.0) even though no particles larger than 1.0µm were present.
