Sorry, I don't have anything to add on your methods but you've got a nice peak around 700 nm which near the chlorophyll fluorescence peak!  Quote from Tufillaro 2011 (see link below):  "Chlorophyll has an absorption minimum near 660 nm, and a flourescence peak near 680.  However, at very high algal levels this peak tends to shift to the read and move as far to the right as 710 nm."
