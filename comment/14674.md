Great documentation! Thanks, Dave. May I ask how you're powering the LEDs? Also let me link to the LEDs. You wrote me that you're doing:

1. [UV 365nm 700mW 4vdc high power single color](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Lite-On/LTPL-C034UVH365/?qs=%2fha2pyFaduj%252bt5U%2fANhxdfT7ZZZw6CeIo2fKYIwfFsZmJzI8XmqR0SH5G7LAPequ)
2. [UV 385nm 550mW 4vdc high power single color](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Vishay/VLMU3500-385-060/?qs=%2fha2pyFadujgbhyotF3rRH3TloYpt4yu%252bB5ndlQlL2hERcWpngJAvSrRNh2Kc9v7)
3. Prolight UV 410nm 350mW high power single color

Number 3 is your own, right? Can you link to a source?

And can you link to the exact oil on http://onta.com? 

Thanks! Just want to be thorough.

Also, we may want to post a calibration spectrum before and after each scan, to be sure there's not drift as things are swapped out. I know this is a lot of extra work, but I'd like to try doing a really clean, rigorous test! Thanks!
