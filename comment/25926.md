Ah, i see! So, when I drop your original image into https://publiclab.github.io/infragram/, and run the equation `(R-B)/(R+B)+(1/3)` (boosting the overall by 33%), i get this result; i've included a screenshot with the scale bar so you can see what NDVI value each color corresponds to. Does that help?

Note that to get an absolute NDVI value, you need to calibrate your intensities using known surfaces, like in this post: https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/10-27-2017/can-we-use-a-color-calibration-reference-card-to-calculate-absolute-values-for-diy-ndvi

That's why I'm able to just add 33% to the output. However, NDVI is still very valuable as a relative measure, so it's up to you if you want to take the extra steps to do an intensity calibration.
