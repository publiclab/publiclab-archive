Sreyanth - Yes, off-line is a valuable capability as it frees the user from the internet and it allows independent capture and retention of spectral data (i.e. capture 50 and upload 3 good ones.)

In searching for peaks (for frequency cal), there are at least 3 approaches: 1) center = max peak value, 2) center = mid-point between sides of peak at -3dB from max peak, and 3) the centroid of the peak. Based on the variety of the spectra uploaded, I'd suggest [#2](/n/2). Remember, image processing doesn't really apply; this is just a 1D waveform.

I'd suggest that with just 2 data points (436nm and 611nm) will not allow a non-linear calculation. Even 3 points is insufficient. Remember that with most of the spectra uploaded, there is clipping which will distort at least one peak. That alone will cause more error to a simple linear approximation that what might be corrected for with a non-linear factor. However, that said, if the non-linearity could be observed using many peaks with a very careful setup, that non-linear correction should apply to every device -- i.e. there would be no need to do non-linear correction on every spectrum.

A much bigger factor is the general failure to capture valid spectrum data to start. I would recommend you take a look at my HDR2 note: http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/notes/stoft/03-09-2014/hdr2-using-over-exposure-to-your-advantage  and think about the source data as everything else comes from that. The source data is of little value if it contains gross errors due to poor SNR and heavily clipped RGB channels. Throwing away most of the data from the full spectral image band and then expecting to extract it later using some alternate technique just isn't possible. Once you throw data away, it's gone. Period.

How about a project with 3 goals: 1) Full-band data extraction and clipping correction, 2) Linear-Only Auto-Cal (from the results of [#1](/n/1)) of only CFL spectra and 3) Off-line data collection to view [#1](/n/1) (and maybe [#2](/n/2)) but only upload either the full image or an auto-cropped 'spectral band' segment of the image. Admittedly ambitious, but at least each element is self-contained.
