I think you miss my point.  I believe that if you take the sensor very deep that the waterproofing will fail due to the increased pressure.  The adafruit web site does not mention any depth limit thus I suspect it has only been tested by connecting one end or the sensor to a computer and dropping the other end into the water to a maximum depth determined by the cable length.  What I understand you want to do is use a waterproof enclosure for the computer and expose the sensor to the water and thus submerge the assembly to a depth greater than the cable length.  Thus you may have water intrusion into the sensor resulting in incorrect measurements.
