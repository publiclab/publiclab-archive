 Hi Ag8n, 
Thanks for the comment.  I am glad you are interested. 
 We just connected the VBAT pin to the +3.3 volt bus.  
You did not miss any description of the circuit.  I just dont like to put them out until I know that they work and have code that works with them.  I think we are pretty close, but have not had time for this particular project.  The circuit board is similar to the one described here: https://publiclab.org/notes/JSummers/08-16-2018/wheetrometer-spectrometer-update-part-2.  If you want more detail send me an email at summers at wcu dot edu and I will provide eagle files, etc.  
Best, Jack
