Very interesting your idea.

I think is important to evaluate what types of plastics that the heater is able to melt. and evaluate also if the viscosity of the molten plastic is low enough to flow through the orifice.

If you put chopped plastic inside the heater, you will need some kind of plunger to press molten plastic.

And the plunger must prevent the molten plastic from leak out the back of the heated tube, and flowing only through the front hole.

Congratulations for your idea.
