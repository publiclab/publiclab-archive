RKI (Riken Keiki) makes an popular 4-gas monitor, the GX-2012, which includes CO, O2 as well as CH4. The cal station doubles the cost of the equipment, but it has a robust data logger, bar hole mode (for surface soil testing) and is super easy to use. It measures H2S in %LEL. The problem with portable gas monitors is that you need the cal station, which add to the cost.

There is also an interesting, low-cost project by another member here on Public Lab using photo paper. It is something I have been wanting to try for a while. [https://publiclab.org/notes/show/10576]

Pinpointing the source of H2S is also important, so having more than one monitor for batch sampling on transects is also useful. Best wishes!
