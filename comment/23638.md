Ah, and regarding `What kind of particulate matter do these sensors work best in (ie they tend to preform worse in traffic-dominant pm than wood smoke-pm)? How fast does factory calibration deteriorate?`   -- maybe you already read this, but [@guolivar](/profile/guolivar) discussed the calibration in relation to those two types of particulate matter in this post: https://publiclab.org/notes/guolivar/01-08-2018/thoughts-on-low-cost-air-quality-sensors#regulated+air+quality+measurements

> It depends, I have found that the Plantower factory calibration does a pretty good job for wood smoke dominated aerosols but not that great for traffic dominated aerosols. At the moment I'm testing their response to "natural" sources (sea salt, dust/sand, etc) as I'm preparing an article reporting on what we've learned about these units.

Maybe [@guolivar](/profile/guolivar) has published this report by now?
