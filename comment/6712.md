Maybe we should call our version of NDVI **"INDVI"** for Infragram-NDVI or something? Or BNDVI for Blue-NDVI? I'm loathe to make an already obscure acronym worse, but it is important to distinguish our technique. Although I've heard of NDVI being calculated from a combined visible range monochrome band too, i think?
