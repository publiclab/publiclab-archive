Hi, Bronwen -- Thanks for your post. I was doing similar math, but somehow it still didn't work! We were trying to lift a camera of only about 70 grams and we couldn't get it airborne with 35 standard party balloons.

We are at higher altitude (4500 feet) -- does that make a difference? Or, we wondered, any chance the helium is "watered down" since it's expensive now? (We bought all the balloons at our local Dollar Store).

Also, we went with mylar balloons, which [@Warren](/profile/Warren) rightfully pointed out are heavier than standard. BUT -- they hold their helium longer.

Long story short, we were trying to find a solution for rural communities that may not have access to helium and hoping they could fill the car with party balloons while in a larger town, then take them to the launch site.

Thanks for the insights, everyone!
