What if, in constructing some algorithm to count silica particles, you used a GIMP or photoeditor threshhold editor on the image? The silica would jump using threshhold.

And,fwiw here's a link to a 2011 article on a d-i-y scanning electron microscope. $1500-a lot, but a lot less than 250,000-In the article, the engineer got 50x magnification. There's a youtube video that goes with it.
I keep thinking about x-ray diffraction, because there are all those electron guns in old CRT tv's and monitors. Found a 1960 article about building your own xray machine...but I'm not going to play with x-rays at home.
