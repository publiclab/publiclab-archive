Hi [@NaruDesigns](/profile/NaruDesigns) thanks so much for your proposal! I really appreciate the careful UI/UX analysis here and like your proposed solutions. One thing is we've been really trying to get the editor to read compactly on mobile devices, so I'm curious about your ideas for that. Even on desktop it's maybe not as compact and streamlined as it could be. 

That said, and as much as I agree that the design proposals are helpful, I was curious if you had thoughts about the testing issues we've faced and how to address them -- or even where in your schedule you would dedicate time to reworking our tests. They're quite important to the maintainability of the project and will also help to solve a few key bugs in the Editor, as they'll help us isolate and reproduce the bugs. Can you think about how these tasks will fit into your project plan? Thank you!
