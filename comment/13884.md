It would be good to know something about the camera and filter you are using. Do you have a spectral curve for the filter? How is the camera white balanced? Are you doing any calibration?

I think by increased resolution you are referring to increased ability to distinguish different levels of plant health or vigor. Is that correct? If so, flying lower will not help. Some of the things that will allow more discrimination among levels of plant health include 1) taking more carefully exposed photos, 2) computing NDVI with NIR and VIS channels which are not cross contaminated, 3) stretching the histograms or calibrating the process, and 4) using a lut that assigns different colors within the narrow range of NDVI values you are interested in.

Fiji (ImageJ) has very powerful tools for doing the analyses you describe. When a new floating point NDVI image is created by the Photomonitoring plugin, hover the mouse over it to see the actual NDVI value of any pixel. Means and standard deviation for the entire image or a marqueed portion are reported in Fiji with Analyze/Histogram/Live.  You can even make a 3D surface plot of the NDVI values in a field (Analyze/Surface Plot). Lots of fun.

Without calibrating the process, it might not be possible to compare NDVI in a field over multiple days. Differences in light quality, exposure, sun angle, or auto white balance will influence the uncalibrated NDVI values. Time might not be the most conspicuous variable in a time series.
