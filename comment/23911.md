Hi Benjamin!

Here's the issue - https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/4094

> I'm not sure that'll take care of all of the "orphans" since some don't have references back to a question but I'll wait and see if the complete transfer takes care of that.

Although, the issue link have pre-planned goals but we are always open to feedback and suggestions. 

Thanks!
