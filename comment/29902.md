Check out " Turning off the plastic" by Patrick Walter.   It's a good read.  He has an editorial in the 30 March 2022 edition of  Chem World.  He makes a few good points- like the next 2 to 3 years will be where the world wide negotiation gets made between countries on the best approaches to handling plastics.
