Did you have the v4l2 test images? 

Sometimes the UVC implementation of the hardware itself is not complete or reliable. This could be the issue here? I'm not very familiar with the errors you're seeing but have also had some trouble with persistent connections to webcams in linux -- they'll stop responding and I have to reboot.
