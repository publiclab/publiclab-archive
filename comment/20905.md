Hi, just catching up after a busy Barnraising event! 

I jotted down some longer textual responses to some common questions at this page: https://publiclab.org/basics

It's not to play the same role as the welcome page but maybe the language and word choice is useful. 

OK - "browse other issues" is great, and perhaps that line could end with just a regular link with text `See more >>` leading to https://publiclab.org/tags ?

The tags list will ultimately be the one currently shown at https://publiclab.org/home, although it doesn't matter a great deal in this mockup. 

I like `Get the right tools` but one issue is that many tools at Public Lab are in prototyping and not yet "ready for field use" so to speak. I wonder if it should say `Get the right tools` but below it `...or help improve in-development ones` (although any help in figuring out a better/smoother way of saying that would be great).

I guess I still think the Tools section should be below How to Participate. 

One more thing - "Find a team to join" might be more like "See who's working on related issues" 

But I feel like we're delving into text a lot here. I'm kind of interested in your thoughts on the code.publiclab.org welcome page and the images it shows. 

Finally - I wanted to hear from [@joyofsoy](/profile/joyofsoy) and [@stevie](/profile/stevie) about this design so far. Do you two have some ideas to offer? Thank you!
