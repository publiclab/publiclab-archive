Those basil leaves should not be the same color as the flower pot. They need to be more orange. To get NDVI values in the appropriate range, the values in the red channel should be several times greater than the values in the blue channel. Here is a typical photo from a CCD camera with a blue filter:

The histogram for one leaf (marquee) shows the red channel being well separated from the blue channel. Below is a histogram for your basil leaf.

Below is an NDVI image from your photo.

NDVI values are very low (around 0.2) instead of near 0.3 to 0.6. They are also not different from the flower pot.

To get better separation between the red and blue values, red has to be exaggerated more. So I guess the red value in awb_gains has to be farther from the blue value. 

I don't know if it is possible to get that orange color with the NoIR camera and a blue filter.
