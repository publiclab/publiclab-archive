Hey [@warren](/profile/warren)! I did a test using the r-pi to take photos in my room, downloaded the images and it worked fine. I then did a mapping with a school last week and have not been able to download a zip of the photos we took.
This time a pop up comes up every time I type it saying it is unsecure but I click send anyway. I've done a screen recording so you can see. The circle loads but nothing downloads.

Any idea how I can get to the photos?
