It makes sense that 26 has more difference between red and blue. The transmission cutoff is farther toward the NIR end of the spectrum, so less red is included. So the red channel gets less light. But the red channel has a higher proportion of NIR:red, and the red channel is supposed to be visible red light. So the increased difference between the red and blue channels does not add any information to NDVI.
