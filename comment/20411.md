In fact, as you've provided this link for your final work product, I think reformatting your .docx file as README.md (markdown) and including it in the root folder of your GitHub repository would be great, as that will appear as the default on https://github.com/MargaretAN9/Peggy/ -- would you be able to do that in the next day? Thanks!
