For example:
If you look to this MapKnitter landfill map it has a 10.75 cm/px spatial resolution.  https://mapknitter.org/map/view/saugus-ash-landfill 
In this map a measurement 10 pixels in length takes up a little over 1 meter(107.5cm).

 Next:
With Photoshop(and likely many other tools) you could either trace new measurements as a new layer or simply use the measure tool to count pixels. The measure tool will interactively count as you make your selection. The process of actually counting the pixels could be done in many different ways. Perhaps it would work best using the magic wand/dynamic selection tool while playing with the tolerance to make proper area selections using the image characteristics.
