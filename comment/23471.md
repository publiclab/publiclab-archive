Hey [@tonchuks](/profile/tonchuks)! 

In the description of the problem, you correctly pointed out that PublicLab.org website needs a better user interface than it currently has to make it easily understandable to the user. I would love if you were able to better describe how the designs proposed by you will enhance the user's experience. It would also be great if you did a comparison with what we have implemented today.
