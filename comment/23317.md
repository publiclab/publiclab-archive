 Here a software oriented approach. The following open source sample in Python language was developed for the blue & golden dress challenge, its an 3D RGB Histogram. The color analysis helps to detect given patterns and separate color nuances and its distribution. You can apply this code to satellite and areal pictures. It might be a starting point for development of your own monitoring system. You find the source code at the following link:  http://marksolters.com/programming/2015/02/27/rgb-histograph.html
