Well, it's your call -- it'd be great to test some residue and we've worked with tarballs from crude that've been sitting on beaches for weeks in the sun; we're testing mostly for the non volatile residues like PAHs. Snow and dirt can be separated out. But it sounds like quite a challenge to get out there.
