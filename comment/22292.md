The question if "which model is best" is not easy to answer as it is always dependent on what the results are used for.
There have been a few studies comparing the performance of these models ... one from 2013 is:

The basic message is that **no single model is always better than the others** but they do state that steady state models (e.g. AERMOD) are preferable for regulatory use as they require less user judgement while lagrangian models (e.g. CALPUFF) require that the user makes lots of decisions that affect the quality of the results and those decisions can only be made with expert knowledge.

I've used CALPUFF many times in the past and I know that it can be over- and mis-used quite easily. On the other hand I haven't used AIRMOD but I suspect that if you're not careful it can also be used outside its purpose.

I can't comment on the particulars of this case as I don't know the details (and I'm half a world away in NZ ;-) ) but in general, the choice of model is defined by the data available to run it and the intended use of the results. Whether that means that CALPUFF is better suited than AIRMOD it's not something I can answer.
