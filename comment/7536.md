I just completed a balloon flight in Mantoloking NJ where there was a breach through the barrier island last year during Hurricane Sandy. It was a very windy day and I got a lot of unexpected oblique images and I am trying to come up with a way of stitching them together to display. Other than the stills, have you found a way to mosaic and georeference them?

One method I was considering was Microsoft Photosynth (http://photosynth.net/) but haven't had the opportunity to give it a shot yet.
