Thanks, that's a good distinction between verify and test-limits. 

I think part of my confusion about Observe was due to the order you used to present the categories. From your new description, I would expect Observe to be listed right before Experiment.

The primary obstacles to implementing these categories are:

1. Many research notes touch on more than one category, and some fall into four or five categories.   
2. It takes some effort to assimilate these categories and then additional effort to figure out which ones apply to a particular research note.   
3. I think a very large proportion of note posters will get it wrong.

There are two approaches to dealing with these obstacles:

1. Reduce the number of categories.  
2. Have a curation committee assign the categories to notes.

Accomplishing the goal of making the quality information in research notes more accessible to the public is probably going to require curation. To start with, somebody has to decide whether a note should be included in the "helpful research" category. The note poster should not have to shoulder that responsibility.
