It is unlikely that you can do anything to stop deposition, but you could slow it. Not sure what degree of "prevent" you were asking about. There are so many types and kinds of particles in the environment, not to mention gases. Even if you found a treatment that prevented deposition of particles, environmental gases might eat away at the coating. It's an uphill battle no matter how the battle is fought.

I was aware of one project which created a tube of hepa-filtered air which carried the dirty air. It was a very clever prototype, but requires some serious engineering to get it right. Not sure about how well it worked in the end, either. That particular trick might be patent encumbered.
