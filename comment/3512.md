I'd be curious to know what the transfer function on the thermistor is.

Are there vendor specs? Even if there are, you'll probably want to calibrate the thermistor by putting it into fluids of known temperature (using a properly calibrated thermometer) and measure the resistance of the thermistor.

I ripped apart a bluetooth hands-free unit and found the microphone wires to be pretty adaptable to any 2-wire resistive device. My particular unit's microphone had a base of 1440 Ohms with a variability of +/- 200 Ohms when I blow on the microphone (white noise should stress the microphone to its limits). If I had an idea of the thermistor's resistance ranges, I might be able to figure out an easy way to integrate it into a hands-free unit for BlueTooth transmission of the analog signal.
