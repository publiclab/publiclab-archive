That looks like a photo taken with a red filtered infrared camera. It is very hard to get meaningful NDVI results directly from this photo because it is too gray. Grayish photos have similar values in all three color channels, so NDVI will always compute to approximately (x-x)/(x+x) = zero.  That seems to be exactly what you got from infragram.org.

*Histogram for an area of vegetation in the photo.*

Good photos from a red filtered infrared camera will have a turquoise hue. The blue channel (NIR) is much brighter than the red channel.

*Photoshop was used to make the photo more turquoise. The histogram is for the area in the marquee.*  
.  
Although it is possible to manipulate the color of this photo so that it produces NDVI values in the proper range, dynamic range suffers greatly and there is little variation in NDVI values.

*NDVI image produced in Fiji from the adjusted photo. In Fiji, the histogram of the NIR channel was stretched because otherwise the result was poor.*  
.  
Although it is possible to manipulate the processing so that reasonable looking NDVI images are produced, such results are rather subjective and generally can be used to infer only the most basic patterns of plant health. The processing I did to this photo is probably not possible at infragram.org.
