As to multiple accounts being made, perhaps we need to consider the possibility of a "merge account" system. 

With the above considerations, and assuming we can implement them successfully, have we addressed your concerns about OAuth => account generation? In the case of Twitter it may involve one extra step of email input, and we can drop people onto the Signup page for that.

Maybe I missed one of the issues you mentioned -- happy to if you want to point it out, as the comment thread has become quite long!

THANK YOU for thinking this through so carefully! Great discussion in here!
