Wow, this is very impressive. It may also be interesting because [@maggpi](/profile/maggpi) will be using some OpenCV, i believe, and potentially work [@maggpi](/profile/maggpi) does could be reproduced in Image Sequencer via an OpenCV module or set of modules. 

Thanks [@amirberAgain](/profile/amirberAgain)!!! 😃
