I'm not sure how different the NIR signal will be when using a Rosco [#2007](/n/2007) vs. [#19](/n/19) or other red filter. Both will allow capture of some distribution of wavelengths between 700 and 900, but the exact distribution will depend largely on the sensor and Bayer filter in the camera. The primary difference among those filters is how much VIS contamination will be in the channel used for NIR. Red filters that don't pass much blue or green will have rather clean NIR signals in the blue channel. The Wratten 25 should give such a result, and Rosco [#19](/n/19) might be similar. Rosco blue filters will have mostly NIR in the red channel but will always have some red (and probably blue and green) mixed in with the NIR and it's really hard to know how much. Neither blue nor red filters will have a very clean VIS channel, since NIR probably contaminates them all. 

So without going to a pure NIR filter (e.g., Wratten 87) the purest NIR channel will probably come from a good red filter like Wratten 25. That will also provide a red VIS channel (with considerable NIR contamination) and a green channel with mostly NIR in it. If you think another VIS channel might be helpful distinguishing vegetation patterns, a yellow filter like Wratten 15 will produce a green channel with some green in it. The other channels will be like the Wratten 25 except that the blue channel will not be as pure NIR.

Which of these filters will produce the best discrimination among slightly different vegetation types is hard to predict. The time of year and time of day are probably equally important if not more so. On the right day, a normal RGB photo from the right angle might reveal as much as any NIR photo. Part of the advantage of an unmodified camera is that it's optics have not been compromised and more light is getting to the sensor so ISO, shutter speed, and aperture can be set for better clarity. 

Which will come first, a $1000 drone that can carry two good cameras (RGB and NIR), or two $500 drones that carry single cameras and fly in perfect formation three feet apart (and sync camera shutters)?
