UPDATE:  See my new research note- http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/01-22-2014/thermal-flashlight-using-mlx90614-ir-evaluation-board-from-sparkfun

 I put this project on hold in order to build a thermal flashlight using the "Evaluation Board for MLX90614 IR Thermometer" from Sparkfun- https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10740
  As you'll see in the research note I'm almost there but haven't figured out the LED part yet.  If I do, this could serve as a reference for the "Visualight" project as it has a much smaller form factor and by replacing the current ATmega328 with a newer microcontroller chip like the ATmega32u4 or ATTiny85 it would have USB-Host support.
