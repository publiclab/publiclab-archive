Hi [@Sagarpreet](/profile/Sagarpreet)! I've been thinking about the library. In the case of the Odor reports I'd include a link to the report to be able to check the info of the marker. Now when you click on the link included in the markes opens a text document. In fact there are at least two kinds of databases: those wich accept public contributions like the Odor log and those that are "closed" to public contributions. Maybe some info related to this would be great so the library will also foster contribution in those databases/maps included, that are public contributed. I don't know if I'm expressing myself correctly. Some tag on the marker or a code of colors: a green dot for grassroots contributing maps and a orange for closed to public maps for example.
