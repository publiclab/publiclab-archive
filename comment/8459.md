Hello xvidun - great start here. You should email grassrootsmapping@googlegroups.com, which is our list for folks doing balloon and kite mapping. I'm sure someone has photos with GPS on them. Or if you can get a hold of photos taken from an iPhone (or often, Android phones) they often have EXIF data on location. Say, if someone's taken a photo out the window of a plane -- you could look for that on Flickr.com, for example. 

The [Sky Camera](/wiki/sky-camera) app is supposed to record EXIF data on GPS, etc. But that feature hasn't been added yet. I think someone is proposing that as a project; check the plots-gsoc mailing list: https://groups.google.com/group/plots-gsoc
