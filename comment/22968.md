I got this running -- it was pretty simple to change a couple files in the `boot` drive. But I found that it wasn't easy to just connect via a web browser -- you have to configure your laptop to connect properly to the Pi's network, which isn't easy for everyone. 

Instead, i'm going to try to get the Pi to produce a WiFi hotspot, called "Microscope" (for this application) which you connect to and it auto-directs you to the microscope page. 

Then as a next step, if you still need internet access, it's apparently possible for a 2nd wifi interface on the Pi to connect in turn to another wifi network. I want to make it possible to configure that connection from the hotspot welcome page... !!! Meta, but it could be pretty seamless once it works.
