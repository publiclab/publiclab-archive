In my [silica wiki](/wiki/silica) page, I mentioned polarized light microscopy as a detection method, and yes, I'm looking into it. 

What you see here is polarized light running through the mica and then through another offset polarized filter.  thats where the color comes from.   a single polarizing filter won't do this, you need the two stage pass through.  The color is indicative of the stress in the material.  here you can see it in polystyrene:
