Hi! Sorry u had trouble... We've found that some DVDs (even in the same batch) are much harder than others for reasons we don't understand. Did you eventually get a big enough clear piece?

> Prepping the DVD is a HUGE pain.  Tried: Xacto knives Duct tape ( works but leaves residue ) Sticking it in the freezer Super glue doesn't work.  The best bet is to split the DVD down the seam ( so that you'd end up with 2 DVD shaped pieces ) and hope that the metallic film stays attached to the top, or the side thats printed on.  The bottom side is what you want.  STILL. An ENORMOUS pain.
