CMU's [breathe cams](https://breatheproject.org/learn/breathe-cam/) are a good example, they track fugitive emissions from sources in Pittsburgh. There [was a site](http://shenangochannel.org) that used to couple cameras with measurements at local county run air monitoring stations, however that source shut down. These breathe cams could probably be used for reporting, as I think there is a video version of smoke reading covered under Method 9. 

There's another CMU initiative called [Smell Pittsburgh](https://smellpgh.org). This is more for qualitative reporting of different sources around the area, though as an app it seems to have relatively wide use and an active user base.  

As for spill reporting, depending on the source it's going to vary, but I know that there are hazardous material spill reporting regs under CERCLA and the CWA that have minimum spill reporting requirements for companies. Not sure about citizen reporting since this is generally required by law on the company's end depending on the magnitude of the spill and what was spilled.
