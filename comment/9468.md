Thanks for the info on the DUSTTRAK. It's good to remember everything comes with advantages and disadvantages. Adjusting for or eliminating humidity carries its own problems. The simplest thing as suggested is discarding readings at high humidity times. A comparison at higher humidity times with the Wisconsin DNR monitor in EauClaire would seem worthwhile for comparative information.
