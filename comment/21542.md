[@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) Thanks for the suggestion to use nanofiltration! I think the main impurities are the electrolytes (e.g. K+ and Na+ ions) that are added into bottled water for taste. Do you know what water purification method works best for removing them? I am thinking along the lines of some kind of low-cost ion exchange system, but am not sure what specifically.
