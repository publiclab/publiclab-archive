It turns out that Alternative Method 82 is pretty strict in its procedure, so timelapse and video cameras wouldn't be able to explicitly do that method, but I think they could probably prompt an inspection. Anyway, I recently learned a lot more about EPA Method 9, and some more about Alternative Method 82, and wrote a blog post about it: https://publiclab.org/notes/gretchengehrke/10-28-2016/colorado-regulations-hotsheet
