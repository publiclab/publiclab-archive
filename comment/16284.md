There are a few misleading things about these suggestions. 

The "Easiest" approach to interval shooting might be to use a camera with that feature built in, e.g., the Mobius Actioncam or many other actioncam type cameras.

Using CHDK requires some attention, but **"Most complex -- difficult to set up"** does not do it justice. It can be very easy to install using STICK, and the rewards in photo quality will be worthwhile for many users trying to capture good aerial photos.

The advice to "Set everything on auto" is very misleading if you are using continuous mode and mashing the shutter button. When shooting a PowerShot in continuous mode, the focus and exposure for all the photos are the same as the first photo taken when the shutter button was depressed. I don't think automatic adjustments are made as subsequent photos are taken.

I'm not sure the phrase **"set the contrast"** applies here. The term "memory" is used here to refer to *storage* (on the SD card).
