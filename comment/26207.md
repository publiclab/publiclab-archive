Hi [@wln215](/profile/wln215), thank you so much for your reply and thanks for sharing your work!

I'm hoping to build a handheld spectrometer (the size of a mobile phone, but can be thicker) with picamera, so I'm wondering if the second lens of your design can be changed to one with a shorter focal length so the whole set up can have a smaller physical footprint? 

What are some considerations that I need to have in order to build a high resolution, handheld spectrometer? 

Thank you!
