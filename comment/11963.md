[@mathew](/profile/mathew) Great work and the title is appropriate!  Sometimes when I’d compare instruments head to head it would be referred to a “shoot out”—an instrument dual of sorts.

A few observations:

1. I’d like to see multiple Buck tests per test flow rate—at least three to show how precise the Buck performs but take more since it's so easy to use.  Any bubble meter, whether it’s a DIY cylinder or a commercial timed system, is prone to errant readings caused by oddly shaped bubbles.  

2. The last tube 2 cylinder time of 39.78 seconds looks like an error and could be transposed incorrectly from your notes since it’s the exact same time as the first time for tube 3. 

3. This analysis quickly becomes a question of “how close is close enough?”  I wouldn’t assume the Buck is perfect and all the flaws are that of the cylinder method.  Looking at Buck’s specifications for this model the flow ranges from 0.1 to 30 lpm with +/- 0.5% of reading accuracy.  That is a huge range and extremely small error.  I’m skeptical the Buck performs this well at the extreme low end of 300 ml per minute.  Manufacturers often exaggerate their performance specifications.

I think the cylinder method could marginally be improved with a glass apparatus but you'd probably need to buy this type of glassware rather than make your own.  I'm not sure how much it would improve the timed cylinder method but glass is easier to read, typically has finer markings, and the volumes are often more reliable if made by a reputable brand.

Looking at your data--and omitting the 39.78 time for tube 2—the DIY cylinder seems to be well within 1% precision—it’s very consistent.

Here's how I graphed the results, with the one time I question circled in red.
