Kina, Thanks for the great information. Liz, It might help to know more about this project. What is the time frame for deployment? What has been tried so far? How many HCHO sensors are there? What data logger are you planning to use? What resolution are you hoping for? What is the minimum resolution you need? How much will the temperature vary where the logger is deployed? Will the sensor and logger be battery powered? How long must the device last on batteries? 

Testing the sensor does not require a data logger, it just requires an Arduino (IOW, no SD card or RTC is needed). Hooking the sensor to an Arduino and watching the serial monitor will tell you a lot. Trying some different code for aref and converting mV to ppb is quick and easy. Has anyone done any of this?
