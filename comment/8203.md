You are going to make a lot of people envious with your lovely crisp images. The NIR photo looks as sharp as the VIS version, so I guess you have a glass IR filter in front of the lens. You should be able to get excellent results with that setup.

The 750 nm IR filter might work better because it should pass more light. Then your exposures can be shorter (or lower ISO, or larger f-stop).

I did a custom white balance on my IR camera (Wratten 87) which eliminates the pink tint. I don't think it makes much difference to the final NDVI, but the pink is just an arbitrary artifact, and black and white NIR photos look cool.

It is not that important to use the exact same shutter speed, aperture, and ISO on both cameras because the NDVI images will be lower resolution (many adjacent pixels will have the same NDVI value). I recorded RAW data via CHDK the first time I did an important flight with the two camera NIR rig, but it was so much trouble I never did it again. When taking aerial photo pairs, the critical thing is synchronizing the shutters and keeping the shutter speeds high. CHDK will allow both of those things (an external timer is also required to synchronize the shutters). I use CHDK to lock shutter speed and the camera selects an appropriate aperture. Generally I use 1/800 for the VIS camera and maybe 1/600 for the NIR camera, but the NIR camera might have a slightly higher ISO.

At the [bottom of this page](http://publiclab.org/wiki/photo-monitoring-plugin) are two look up tables for Fiji which work well for NDVI and images of the color gradient which you can publish with your results. NDVI images have little meaning to most people without a key.

I'm looking forward to the aerial photos.
