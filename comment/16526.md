yip. just discussing on our other mail list of the "Center for Alternative Coconut Research". below the response from Christoph.

and yes, sofar we focused on a bootloader, so non-geeks, can easily change the code on the board. great for musicians or other non-tech people, and we can share synthizers on a website as .wav files. similar for wearable applications of the attiny85. the original code is ancient... developed for the atmega168, but not yet for 328.

we also worked on a real-time communication, again for the synth, we mostly want to sent "to" the microcontroller to change settings/parameters, but the other way around will happen soon aswell. some web-based interface is also on the horizon.

greetings from hamamatsu,

Response, says its 10x faster:
Hi Marc,

if the webjack people would do any coding for the project, I would
strongly recommend that they move to the digital differential manchester
coding as I use it in the bootloader.
The coding principle is 10x faster than the one they use and it is much
easier to implement and the calculation load for the microcontroller is
less.

Cheers,
Christoph
