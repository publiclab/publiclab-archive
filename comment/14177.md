Hey estabean, great question, well I use ethanol because it can dissolve both polar and non-polar compounds, what this means is, like oil, gasoline is a hydrocarbon (aromatic hydrocarbons to be exact.) which is non-polar (like in an electrical charge, positive and negative, although a little more complex than that.) if I just sample that gasoline "as is," I'm not going to be able to decifer any information from the peak because all the info is hidden inside, so I have to elute, or separate those components that I want to see.

Yes gasoline can contain ethanol but its usually 10% by volume, so it's concentration is very trivial. Yes if you wanted to see if there was 2 stroke oil contamination in a sample of gasoline there are steps you can follow in the data sampling, because you can read the signature peaks and wavelength data of the oil sample that I did.
