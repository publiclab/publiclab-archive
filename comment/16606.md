That Openlog is tiny! It combines an Arduino 328p with a microSD card, but still needs an RTC.  There are [clones of it available for $7.00](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Micro-SD-Openlog-Serial-Data-Logger-Open-Source-Data-Recorder-ATmega328-Support-/262946820610). I have not found a version that adds an RTC, so that has to be connected (i.e., soldered). If you are going to solder, you can start with a Pro mini [($2.00)](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Redesign-Pro-Mini-atmega328-3-3V-8M-Replace-ATmega128-Arduino-Compatible-Nano-GM-/262136733170) and add an SD card and RTC and stay under $5.00 total.
