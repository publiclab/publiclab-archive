I found that a 12v "23A" battery (for car remotes) fits perfectly into an "N-type" battery holder, providing the needed 12v to drive this circuit. Good thing; I was worried about finding a small 12v battery, and the actual "N" battery is only 1.3 volts.

$0.45 each for N battery holders: http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-store/item/BH-50/N-CELL-BATTERY-HOLDER/1.html (also [on digikey for ~$0.60](http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/BH23AW/BH23AW-ND/2439315))

$3.22 for 5 23A batteries: http://www.amazon.com/Alkaline-Batteries-GP-23AE-pack/dp/B002E4UWWQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1330437815&sr=8-2
