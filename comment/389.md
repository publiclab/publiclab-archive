Dection range:targeted, <0.25 ppm achieved
crossreactivity: Selectivity of HCHO detection versus benzene, CO, H2O 
sufficient to prevent false alarm targeted, 50 pm CO 
response is smaller than 0.75 ppm HCHO. 
speed of sensor:about one minute to the peak.  
recovery time:20 minutes
able to use directly with arduino:Yes
