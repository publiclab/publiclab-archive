This conversation may get a little write-up FYI.

The shimmering air is probably caused by refraction.  The heated air has a different RI then cold air.  So you get shimmering.  You see it in dry places like the sahara, etc. 

As for the paticulate, there should be a way to detect it. But if you are at any distance, visual methods combined with the small particle size, could make it difficult. A better method could be to detect the flame temperature.  This could be done by measuring the visual color or taking the temp with an IR thermometer.

As for the related question.  I wouldn't look for particulate matter.  Instead, I would try atomic emission. The hottest part of the flame is above the colored part of the flame.  Certain elements will emit light when heated in these flames.  Often, it takes nitrous oxide/ acetylene flames to get elements not enough.  But there are some that work at lower temps.  It's a variation on putting elements in a Bunsen burner and watching the flame change color.  It would take development work, but it might be feasible.
