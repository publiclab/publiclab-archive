So I'd like to try this technique to select a subset of images to make a hypr3d model with -- since it only allows a few hundred images to be uploaded. I'm going to futz with the ruby script to see if I can automate the whole process, but first I'd like to do some tests to see if it actually works.

My plan is to test 2 scenarios: 

1. Copy every 50th photo (should be about 40 pictures) into a subset, and upload them to MapMill, and ask people to rank them by visual analysis. Then compare to their ranking by filesize.

2. Do the same thing, but for 2 separate shorter runs -- say, 20 consecutive images. My idea is that although Stewart is right -- images of a rooftop or water will be lower filesize in general -- that for a short run, there will still be variability and in a set of 20 consecutive images, crisp images will still be larger than the local average. Repeat the same test in MapMill. 

How does that sound as a test? I can go to the mailing list for help in the manual sorting.
