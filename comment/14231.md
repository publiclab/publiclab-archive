Super note, Dave! It answers and raises questions:

1. "the camera is not providing fixed exposure control" -- we'd expected this, and anticipated that it'd be the hardest thing to control for. Do you think that we'd see error drop significantly if we disabled automatic exposure adaptation on the webcam?
2. I loved your use of current to monitor stability. I'm wondering if the 12v power source increases or decreases stability over time. It'd be great to try this with a standard 110v Edison bulb to see if variability is higher or lower. 
3. For automated interval shooting, please take a look at this macro [@vietchdokter](/profile/vietchdokter) has been using for his timed tests: https://publiclab.org/notes/viechdokter/04-13-2016/automated-captures#c14209

This would be a great test to run with slight variations to learn other related unknowns. For example, I'd love to see (quantitatively) how much the added rigidity of your setup improves stability. Do you have an unmodified PL v3 spectrometer for comparison? As we discuss ways to increase rigidity in the design at a minimum of cost/complexity, I'm interested in **how much added rigidity gains how much stability**. But I know this may be outside the scope of your interest for this note!

Also -- this is a great test for folks to try to reproduce. We've been talking about a "reproduce-me" tag inviting others to try to re-run a test on their own, to increase replications. Maybe this is a good one to try that idea out with?
