Ok. Let's go through it step by step.  

First, after a little digging, it looks like there are two frequencies used 315 mh z and 433 mhz. So it would take two rtlsdr dongIes. I'm more familiar with windows and sdr#.  But, as long as you have two usb ports and two rtlsdr dongles, in Windows you could open multiple instances of sdr#. Both frequencies could be covered at the same time.

  This program is based on gnu radio. That part, I don't know about. Maybe the Reddit rtlsdr could fill in the details.  Or compile the program so it could run on Windows in multiple instances? 

As for the cost, the dongles are often found on ebay for $10.  You must be careful they are The right ones. 

The programming changes for counting are beyond me.  Sorry.
