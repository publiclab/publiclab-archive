So... how about turning the (DVD holding) paper thing around and create a paper housing all around the wooden block with a parallel surface, a rectangle hole and have the DVD glued to it? This way you get a more rigid but similarily cheap sub-assembly that doesn't depend too much on the velcro. You could even glue the wooden block to the wooden base. You could also print a line onto the wooden base saying "glue the wooden block exactly here!"
