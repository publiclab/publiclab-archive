There is probably someone living down the street from you who knows the names of all the trees in Berlin and would be flattered if asked to share their knowledge. Maybe a local birding group (birders also know trees) or environmental education center can help you find these knowledgeable people. 

There are online groups who can help identify plants but you must submit good photos of the appropriate plant parts, so you need some knowledge to take the photos. That's why finding an actual person with knowledge is a great way to get started. 

iNaturalist.org is an excellent example of a way to crowd source plant identification (and also document the plant). It appears that there are about 20 people who have contributed a [few dozen identifications in Berlin](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=12872). Maybe one of them could help.
