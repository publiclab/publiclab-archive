I like that a lot. And for usernames -- we could prompt for username like `warren1` based on a best-guess -- github and twitter have usernames (if they're not taken) and google has `_____@gmail.com` (again, if not taken). 

We can say:

Username: `jywarren` <= in a form, guessed from my GitHub handle, but we let people change it before we save

The other option, to riff on what you're saying, Sidharth -- we could basically bump people to the signup form, but pre-populate everything with what we are able to guess from their other account. [@liz](/profile/liz), what do you think of that vs. only asking the absolute minimum in a stripped-down signup form?
