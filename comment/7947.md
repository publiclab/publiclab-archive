Ok, I'm new to this group.  I'm Biologist interested in capturing spectral data.  I am often doing field work with no cell or wifi available and working with iOS devices.  Is there a mobile version of the beta capture or other versions for iOS devices (iPhone), or will there be in the near future for the Spectral Workbench?
