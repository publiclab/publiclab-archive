Hi Don,
I agree with Cversek that you need to keep the voltage difference small.  you also might want to look at using graphite electrodes.  The kinetics of water redox reactions is dependent on the chemical identity of the electrodes and carbon is pretty good for limiting this (not as good as mercury, but I am pretty sure you dont want to go there).  In addition to complicating the measurement of RC behavior of the solution, water hydrolysis can cause bubbles to form on your electrodes changing their effective surface area and consequently the time required to charge and discharge your capacitor.

I would like to point out that we wrote a research note on measuring conductivity a while back (http://publiclab.org/notes/JSummers/11-21-2013/conductivity-meter).  The instrument described in that note generates a square wave with 100 mV amplitude and measures the AC current passed between the two electrodes.  We have not been working on this project lately because I haven't had a student show much interest in it.  I recall that when we had this project active, I intended to drop the voltage lower, to perhaps 50 mV peak to peak or perhaps even lower. Since the current for this type of measurement drops off exponentially after the voltage step, the sensitivity of the measurement can be adjusted by changing the delay between the voltage step and the current measurement.  This can be easily done in the code.

There is also a method in a book called "Environmental monitoring with Arduino" by by Emily Gertz and Patrick Di Justo (Oâ€™Reilly Media, Inc., Sebastopol, CA).  Chapter 5 in this book is called: Water Conductivity / Numerical Output and describes a simple conductivity meter.
