I do believe [@pinpointmapping](/profile/pinpointmapping) has the right idea.  Unfortunately Pix4D software is orders of magnitude more expensive than $100 even if you go with the free crippled version because of the processing hardware requirements.  Perhaps there is some open-source package available that works as well but I have not found it yet.  Perhaps the http://www.adapteva.com/parallella/ will get some software written for it that will do what we want.

The "LIDAR" you are referencing is probably better labeled as a laser/LED altitude sensor.  The problem you will have with it is that the field of view will be around 20 degrees, as one of the devices you reference states.  That will result in a large pixel size which, of course, is dependent on the altitude.  Get a protractor out and see what area is included with different distances.  A real LIDAR will have a laser beam (think laser pointer) scanned over the viewing area and each spot that the laser shines on will be used to measure height resulting in a much smaller pixel size.  (This is a little simplified but broadly accurate.)  

Any way I am interested in your results we may all learn something from your endeavors.
