I've just bought a [$40 GoPro look-alike](https://www.amazon.com/Action-Waterproof-Recorder-Camcorder-Batteries/dp/B01DG9UMS6/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?_encoding=UTF8&keywords=sj8000&pi=SL75_QL70&qid=1497436247&ref_=mp_s_a_1_2&sr=8-2) that has WiFi, and will be testing it out at the [Appalachia Barnraising](/barnraising). We'll check in once we've done this and upload photos --- most likely to this page, where we've been checking/testing GoPro camera alternatives!
