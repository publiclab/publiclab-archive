Hi aldehyde - Did you look at the user guide on Github: https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin that should have information about creating the CSV file of target reflectance. Here is the excerpt from the user guide:
--
Before running the plugin you must create a comma-separated variable (CSV) file with the reflectance values for each of the reference targets in the image that you want to use to calculate the calibration coefficients. The rows of the CSV file correspond to the targets and the columns are the target reflectance values for the visible and near-infrared wavelengths that correspond with the camera filter being used. For example, the following values are for two targets (first line is the bright target and second line is the dark target):
0.86696300, 0.90032700 
0.04748605, 0.05665055
