How about using [vegetarian capsules]( http://www.amazon.com/Now-Foods-Veg-Capsules-Capsules-750-Count/dp/B0014UEEE8)? This kind is made out of [hydroxypropyl methylcellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypromellose) (or HPMC). They also make vegetarian capsules out of [pullulan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullulan), a polysaccharide derived from tapioca. I'm not sure if either of these two options would fluoresce or not.
