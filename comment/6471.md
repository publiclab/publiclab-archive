Hi Martin, That's a beautiful spectrum. You obviously got everything lined up perfectly. I don't know about the extra line near 405 nm because my camera is not very sensitive in that region. But the line near 538 nm always appears in my CFL spectra. See https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/4270 and https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/4474. I suspect the line near 405 is real too. Very nicely done.
