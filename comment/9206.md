Great note!

I'm just going to paste in some of the comments from our email thread here, for reference:

"Note in [this photo comparison](http://penbay.org/gac/gacshore_1940_2011_tips.jpg) the expansion of the peninsula between 1940 and 2011, with the spent phosophogypsum and bauxite wastes.

"Here is a [1984 site assessment](http://penbay.org/gac/deltachem_1984_soil_gwater_test/delta_1984_soil_water_test_pg0__title.html) that includes conductivity surveys of the beach and intertidal This should serve as a  useful historic background standard. 

"I also believe that the [complicated geography](http://penbay.org/gac/gac_abandoned_bldg_tank_pollutedflat.jpg) of the most afflicted cove has an immense impact on where the wastes are going once they're off the eroding bank. This includes  effects of  the mitigation sandbar  closing off much of it, the causeway illegally built to Sears Island in the 1980s (supposed to be a bridge!); the remains of stone walls from now vanished  structures;  all these  concentrate the runoff and orchannel different wastes from different parts of the point into at least three separate outlets into  greater Stockton Harbor."
