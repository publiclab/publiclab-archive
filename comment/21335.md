yes, this image was may be too much edited, but I didn't took the same photo that I put in the post before, I had a much clearer photo. I used a piece of CD for diffraction. I posted another spectrum with the last and best photo I took, that was quite clear an defined, without so much edition, I think I named this post 3new spectrum... the rest is similar. the phone I used was aquarius bq
