a $300-400 quad will hardly fly long enough to map much (10 minutes), and is likely to get blown  going to get blown away in the wind.  I'd recommend going to a fixed-wing craft made out of expanded PP foam so that it can survive a few crashes, like the MAJA.    None of these platforms are going to lift a ton of equipment though, their payloads are usually around 500g-1kg.  I don't know much about multiWii, but Paparazzi is a really robust automation platform you should look at.  And don't forget to get FAA clearance for educational use. 

If you're on the coast of Maine, why not just use kites? dead simple, cheap, and they can lift many pounds of gear, no FAA clearance required.
