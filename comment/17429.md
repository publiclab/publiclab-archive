Hi, [@jbreen](/profile/jbreen) -- I'm working on a related Leaflet project if you still have any time to add in the permalink and coords plugins you found -- https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-archive is designed to try to display a map based on an https://Archive.org image collection, using the GPS Exif tags. If you're looking for a project! Trying to widen the set of imagery we can run through this workflow.
