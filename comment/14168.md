hey! Thanks for responding, well my verdict is, that indeed the more expensive laser does exhibit more coherent stability over time, but both the cheap one and the expensive one were neck in neck as far as over all intensity and excitation levels.

The 200.00 laser has to be handled with more care though, at more than 20mW it tends to heat the sample up pretty quick.
