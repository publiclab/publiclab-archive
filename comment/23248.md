**These answers came from Twitter user [@Sulfur_Blue](/profile/Sulfur_Blue) on a tweet I shared through the Public Lab Twitter account:**

_Consider overall costs / maintenance (membranes require electrolytes), calibration, logging compatibility / data transfer, portability, can the electrode be replaced or the entire unit, how often are parts discontinued, warranty, detecting limits._

_For more general scientific information check out major supplier websites for more detailed specs, features, functionalities, data logging methods....then scale down knowing what features you need and which are optional._

_Major vendors will often provide demos of the instrument for your samples. Contact the local sales rep. The sales rep is also helpful for product support such as method development, troubleshooting or other questions. Consider non-membrane electrodes_ https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/dissolved-oxygen-probes/odo-bta/
