[@stevie](/profile/stevie) : 
1. 555 timer lifetime is close to 1000 hours with/without battery.
2.  If the same electrodes have been used for all testing/analysis,  sometimes, conductivity will not differ as the electrodes have been exposed to air for a longer time.
3. check the frequency range with other liquids too.
4. If none of these works, change 555 timer, or the electrodes.
