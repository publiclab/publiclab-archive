The local electric companies are usually good places to start for more information.  It can start with turning off lights when not in use.  Then go to putting timers on appliances ( for example water heaters).  Each additional step usually costs more money in the short term, and saves more money in the long term.  During the summer, the electric companies used to have electric auditors to suggest energy saving steps.  With Covid, I don't know where that stands this year.
