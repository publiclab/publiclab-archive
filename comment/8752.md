Is the levels stretching you are referring to the same thing as histogram stretching? If so, it should be high priority.

If the look up table feature gets incorporated into Infragrammar, maybe we should revisit the lut I have been using and promoting. To make it possible to interpret and troubleshoot everybody's NDVI results, it would be good to have a single lut. Otherwise, the NDVI images have limited meaning, especially because few people post a key to their NDVI images.

If there will be a single lut, it should be a good one. One shortcoming of the one I have been using is that it is not friendly to those with protanopia. Green represents low plant vigor and red represents high plant vigor, so the images are pretty useless to those with red-green color blindness.

Also, I wonder if making the threshold between plant and non-plant, which is currently at NDVI=0, closer to NDVI=0.1 would be better. With the current lut, green can be low vigor plant (0.1 to 0.2) or it can be non-plant (0.0 to 0.1).

Another useful thing is to have the 0 and 255 values distinct colors so you know if your protocol is producing lots of those values (which usually means there is a serious artifact creeping in). Here is a similar lut as above with white or black for the end members.
