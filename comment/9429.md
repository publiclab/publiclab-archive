sorry for the late reply but as you probably discovered as the air sample relative humidity increases, the moisture increasingly interferes with the optics.  a few possible solutions:

1. heat the air sample to reduce the relative humidity. Ideally you'd control the temp to maintain a constant RH.  this is a battery killer though and typically only works when connected to the grid.

2. you can dry the air sample:

2a) mix with dry air--easier said than done!

2b) dry with a nafion dryer (from permapure.com ).  They can be used a few different ways but essentially you need heat, compressed air, or a strong air pump (differential pressure) to drive out the moisture.  

note that whenever you heat or dry the sample you're changing the particle size so the challenge is to reduce the RH just enough to minimize water interference but not dramatically change the sample.
