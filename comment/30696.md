Nitrogen is the natural element that's essential for reproduction and growth of biotic things .
It is a core component of amino acids which are a building block for nucleic acids and proteins, which are also the building blocks of life/ genetic material​.
Our main source of nitrogen is the atmosphere. ​
Most of the air we breathe is composed of nitrogen which takes up 78% of the air.
