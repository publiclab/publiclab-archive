we picked the Sanm camera specifically because exposure control was implemented... it would be news to me that it doesn't work. exposure control is rarely, if ever implemented in any USB software packages, so I'm not surprised you can't find it.  
GUVCview being an exception.  I don't have my linux machine on me right now but I'll check with a newer production unit.
