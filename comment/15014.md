I find this very exciting, yet it is too difficult for someone like me without the extensive knowledge in chemistry you and others here are showing! Would it be possible to help me design a workflow that would allow me to say whether there is 2 stroke oil present in a gasoline sample or not? What would happen if I just separated (centrifuged) a sample and scanned it. Would I see the different spikes or would the information, as you say, be convoluted and impossible to see?
