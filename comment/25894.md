Love this build and excited to work more with these sensors. Thanks for putting together such great instructions. 

I had a chance to work with one of these sensors yesterday, and I wonder if the LED is the best way we can show a quick change in the turbidity. When testing samples that we could see a clear difference in visually and via sensor reading, the change in the rate of LED flashing was so small we couldn't easily visualize it. 

I wonder if we could make the LED more sensitive to these changes someway or perhaps use sound and a buzzer like the Coquí?
