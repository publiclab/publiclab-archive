Hi Chris,

I captured the images using the infra gram's point & shoot camera.I converted these captured images into NDVI image using python script.I changed in python script 's NDVI equation from (R - B) /( R + B) to (B -R)/(B+R).

I shared the python code's below link for your reference.

Infragram point & shoot camera 's captured image.

Using python script converted NDVI image
 
My quires related to NDVI index are below.
1) Can i consider this NDVI image as a good NDVI image ?
2) Can i use this NDVI index information for calculating the plant health ?

Regards,
