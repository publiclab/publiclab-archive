OK, a bunch of solved problems!

* figured out the height difference -- needs to be resolved, but I believe due to a bug, we were multiplying each pixel by the final entry in your correction file -- `2.667`. In any case it was just scaling the whole graph by 2.667, so my just-published fix resolves that.
* It's hard to get SWB to "know" that something is a CFL, but I'm going to try to add some more notices if, for example, operations are in an order that doesn't make sense -- like a `linearCalibration` after a `calibrate` operation. The tools are very new to everyone, so i'm sure it'll be helpful.

Now, on to the success! I believe I got this to work; see screenshot and [check out the output data](https://gist.github.com/jywarren/83f0cc65c7106ec4f6cf):
