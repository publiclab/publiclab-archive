Good point [@liz](/profile/liz) - there are equations for determining risk based on exposure routes and factors, population characteristics (ie- age) and known total concentrations of lead. A clear methodology would be good because total concentrations don't give a good estimation of risk- perhaps NHANES or the Washington State Dept of Health would share their methodlogy? I tried to look into the Washington State Depts methodology for creating the lead exposure map you asked about, and interestingly they also have info about other contaminants. Their methodology seems to be based on bioinformatics on urine samples of the population.
