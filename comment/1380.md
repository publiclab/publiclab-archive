Warren,
Thanks for the quick response. Either of your methods would be good, and here is a cheap and dirty one that could be tried;  it uses a source we all have access too --- the sun.

The solar spectrum varies with atmospheric conditions, but I think is fairly stable for an approximate calibration.  So, for people from equatorial to mid-latitudes this might be doable.  It would help to have each person calibrate at local noon to minimize atmospheric effects as much as possible, and it could be problematic for people at high altitudes.

As mentioned in the mailing list discussion, separate calibrations for R, G and B would probably be best.

I don't think this would be viable to get an "absolute" calibration (i.e. to extract watts/cm2) but to give a calibration that could allow one to say the the intensity at wavelength A  is x times the intensity at wavelength B.
