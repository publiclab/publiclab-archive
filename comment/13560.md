Oh, it doesn't have to be CC-BY-SA -- it could be CC-BY; your permission here wouldn't be CC-licensing but just a one-off to us, right? The only reason we ask for CC-BY or CC-BY-SA is so that anyone can reuse our final document with all its images without having themselves to ask for permission. We can also keep things simple and just use images that've been published CC-BY or BY-SA and you don't have to worry about it. Thanks, Scott!
