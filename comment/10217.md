Hi Chris, your supposition is right, my white balance was done at direct sunlinght, I tried today balancing in the shadow and the new images appears almost the same to me (the photo was taken 2h later, so different light) , I expected a more orange hue after reading your post "balancing act", but seeing the ndvi image it has slightly more higher ndvi values, the values over a part of the leaf  without any shadow now are 0,35 where in the previous photos was about 0,25, so yes, the balancing in the shadow results in higher ndvi values.

<div align="center"><img align="middle" src="https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/649/medium/filter_comp_3.PNG"></img></div>

( down photo is white balanced in the shadow, and the one above with direct sunlight)

Regarding the shadows I compared histograms for a shadow part of a leaf and there is a reduction of 43% in the red channel and 65% on the blue, that agrees with your explanation of having less light than NIR at the shadows and that results in greater difference and therefore ndvi value.


Thanks, I really appreciate the great labour at this site sharing knowledge.
