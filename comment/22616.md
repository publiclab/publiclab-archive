Hi! A common question and I wish there were a better answer:

Short answer: yes, it is possible to run offline, but it's not easy. You'd have to install it yourself from the documentation at https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter

But there is the just-one-image-at-a-time [Leaflet.DistortableImage](https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage) mini-project we built (it's the core interface of MapKnitter) which you can use offline much more easily, but it's not as powerful; no persistent data, for example. 

The biggest issue is really that without an internet connection there's no map to stitch against, does that make sense? You need the base map for reference.
