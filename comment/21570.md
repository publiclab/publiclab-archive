Thanks, Eva! I've been thinking about the dashboard and looking at the current design; one thing I notice is that it's generally divided into 4 quadrants:


[![image.png](/i/28485)](/i/28485)

Just looking at your above designs, I'd like to think about these same purposes along these lines.

One that's missing that you've added is a "Near me" area -- I love that. 

One idea I had on Blog was that we could treat the blog post as just another Activity item, but a "pinned" one that stays at the top. Also, the "topics" area is very important and [@liz](/profile/liz) and [@stevie](/profile/stevie) have been working on making those topics present across the site. I wonder if we could think about how such a menu of topics might remain, but be useful as an organizing system for Activity. Rather than the overwhelming range of topics of Activity, you'd be able to see activity by topic. 

Maybe the default view would still be "all topics" even so.

[@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) is also working on getting people to more quickly subscribe to topics, say for example [#lead](/tag/lead) as [@read_holman](/profile/read_holman) is interested in, or [#conductivity](/tag/conductivity) as [@roberts_ecofarm](/profile/roberts_ecofarm) is. He may have some thoughts to share on how we might offer to subscribe people to topics either in or above the activity feed. We've talked about how "trending topics" is one way to do it, but perhaps offering "related topics" based on what people are already subscribed to, or even what topics are active nearby their location, could be another way to get people engaged into the various topic-oriented communities. There's a lot here; i'd love to hear from [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) and [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano) about their thoughts on this too!

One last thing -- I'd love to see more people featured here. Is there a way that we could have content more clearly coming from specific people, or show how many people are participating in different topic areas? This is more of a "tone" thing - I think it's important to emphasize that these are communities, not just documentation or technologies. So that's a pretty abstract ask, but just to put it in peoples' minds!

Thanks!!!
