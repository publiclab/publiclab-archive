 Looks like a nice clean construction. The glue should help mechanical stability. I did notice the swap from DVD to what appears to be a film holographic grating -- as you noted it was "warped". I'd suggest two things: 1) discover the lines/mm, compare that with a DVD and run the numbers for the impact on the diffraction pattern, and 2) investigate the mechanical aspects of using such a film.

Remember, the diffraction optics are relative to the wavelength of light so the accuracy of the diffraction pattern is dependent on collimated light passing through parallel grating lines (which, with the film, are not guaranteed parallel). [There is a 'band of illumination' of many grating lines which all contribute to the diffraction pattern. The slit approximates collimated light, adding a little error, but a non-planar grating could cause significant distortion.] Recall that the grating works by creating an interference pattern which varies with wavelength so wavelength-size surface anomalies can cause significant distortion to the interference pattern and thus the detected spectrum. It also thus follows that rigid mounting of the grating is directly related to spectral stability -- especially in terms of measured wavelength vs calibrated wavelength for any given specific camera pixel. ... there is also the issue of mechanical shift of a thin film due to temperature change which is probably significantly greater than the more rigid DVD substrate. True, the DVD is not an ideal grating and it has curvature to the lines but at least it is relatively flat and rigid.

Also, recall the diffraction formula: diffraction angle = asin(L/d) where L=wavelength of incident light and d=grating line spacing. So the line spacing will determine the diffraction angle which impacts the wavelength-change per pixel spectral resolution at the camera. DVD vs film line spacing might be quite different.
