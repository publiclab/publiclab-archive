Sure, BNC connectors just connect to two pins.  It would be fairly trivial to exchange one or both BTA connectors with BNC connectors.  It would mean making an Eagle footprint for the connector you want to use, but the Sparkfun tutorial on this is pretty good (https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/designing-pcbs-smd-footprints).  I would use a connector that mounts on the board.
If I were willing to make my own probes, I would start with phone or ethernet jacks because you can buy the stuff at Lowes.
Bad news about the barking:  the dogs tell me that I need to get the code on GitHub as well.
