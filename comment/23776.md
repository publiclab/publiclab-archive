Yes, i think we can include OpenCV.js in a module to start with -- with a CommonJS `require()`, most likely, to prove this out a bit (also being aware that the .js file itself is really huge! And will take some time to even load!), and then base a more general purpose module support library around making it available for other purposes.&nbsp;
  

I didn't know GDAL.js existed! Cool!!!&nbsp;[@tech4gt](/profile/tech4gt), take a look!

  

Thanks,&nbsp;[@MaggPi](/profile/MaggPi), for your great follow-up notes here.&nbsp;

> Hi, really interested in how you would approach porting OpenCV.js to Image Sequencer. Since “OpenCV.js leverages emscripten to compile OpenCV functions into asm.js or WebAssembly targets” I was wondering if GDAL.js [https://www.npmjs.com/package/gdal-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gdal-js)) could also be imported at the same time (since it seems to also use emscripten)? This would help with loading more file formats such as geoTIFFs.    Another great question you discuss is whether Image Sequencer modules are more easily implemented in OpenCV.js. (List of opencv.js modules are listed under embindgen: [https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/js/src/embindgen.py#L82-L171](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/js/src/embindgen.py#L82-L171))  It may be useful to have a general way to access multiple OpenCV.js functions and 'read/show' across Image sequencer.
