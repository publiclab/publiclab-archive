This is really cool.  I would never want to discourage someone from using a 555.  And it would be totally sweet to use audio gear to record and imagine changes in resistance using the 555 as an oscillator.

BUT-- I don't think you need the 555 unless its frequency generator functions as a sort of amplifier for a weak signal. I doubt that this is useful though. I think you can do it directly through your system's ADC.

The 555 uses a [voltage divider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider) to set the frequency based on the divider's ability to step down voltage.  An ADC can already measure voltage, here's [arduino code for getting back to a voltage](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/DirectMathVoltmeter) from a raw data input.  With that, you can use [the voltage divider equations in the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider#Resistive_divider) to solve for the unknown resistance of the water.
