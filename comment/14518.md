I don't think I ever posted a tube fluorescent spectrum. But that's a good idea because those Wikipedia spectra of tube lamps don't all have the second peak near 544 nm. That would be consistent with the 544 nm peak being from something other than mercury (since mercury is present in all the lamps).
