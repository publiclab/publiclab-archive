Nice proposal [@priya17081](/profile/priya17081), I think testing will require more time and please do add some more about testing as [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano) have already stated --but good work. And also, please make a timeline in table format you can do it using markdown so that it will be clear for the other folks to understand while going through your proposal. 

Thanks
