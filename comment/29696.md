Journal Entry 1:
I saw a plastic bottle on the ground when walking. Based on that, I can assume that once purchased by someone to quench their thirst, they simply "disposed" of it. Obviously not the proper way since they probably aren't aware of the damage they can cause to the world since they didn't recycle it.
