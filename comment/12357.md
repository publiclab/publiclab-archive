The first thought was that we need something to compare this to. What do/would the other lower power options cost for a similar setup? Do we want to account for other costs like ease of use in the equation?

Parts questions

- Ubiquity Nano: It says 12V power supply but all the ones I see are 120V. 
- 5 gallon bucket: You may need one with a lid otherwise moisture will condense on the inside. Maybe something like http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BMVT2I2 would be better.
- Solar panel: 
- Battery: 
- Timer: 
  - The one I have takes about 2w to run
  - Looks like the one you linked to would go on and off 2 times a day. http://www.amazon.com/Xen-Lux-Electric-Indoor-Mechanical-Timer/dp/B006OQTZ4Q can be set in 15 min increments (96 settings/day)
  - To avoid an inverter you would need to find a 12v version of this.

Power profiles: Testing w/ a Kill-A-Watt...

- Pi
  - [A+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-a-plus/) uses 1w
  - [1B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b/) uses 4-5w
  - 1B with usb hard drive and charging a 7" tablet uses up to 16w
- Nanostation
  - Don't have one, but I saw [5w max power ratings](http://www.flyteccomputers.com/ext/Ubiquiti/loco5.pdf). Seems like the NSM5 is what takes 8w.
  - According to this post on the Ubiquiti community forums] the Nanostation M5 (which is rated at 8w max) uses between 3.6w and 4.8w. Extrapolating from that a 5w max power device would use between 2.25w and 3w.
    
Scenario 1 (1B pi 6 hours/day)

- Power usage
  - 4.5w + ((3.6+4.8)/2 = 4.2w) = 8.7w * (15m * 24h = 6h) = 52 Watt hours (35 if you can find a 10m/hour timer)
- Solar
  - If you choose Burlington, VT which has [2.1 average sun hours in the least sunniest month of the year](https://www.altestore.com/store/calculators/off_grid_calculator/) you need a 32 watt panel.
  - This [30 watt panel for $79](https://www.altestore.com/store/Solar-Panels/altE-Poly-30-Watt-12V-Solar-Panel/p10350/) would be a little small but might due.
  - Something like this [Charge controler](https://www.altestore.com/store/Charge-Controllers/Solar-Charge-Controllers/PWM-Type-Solar-Charge-Controllers/Steca-Solar-Charge-Controllers-PWM/Solsum-66F-6A-1224V-Charge-Controller/p7878/) for $29 should handle everything needed to make sure the battery is maintained properly (not to much charge or discharge, etc.)
- Battery
  - [For critical loads, being able to handle 3 consecutive cloudy days is recommended.](http://www.wholesalesolar.com/solar-information/battery-bank-sizing)    
  - Calculating for 52wh, 3 days w/o sun, and 20F you need a [12v 48ah battery](https://www.altestore.com/store/calculators/off_grid_calculator/)
  - Something like this [12 Volt 55AH Battery](http://www.apexbattery.com/12v-55ah-22nf-wheelchair-battery-replaces-48a.html) for $88
- Price
  - For solar/battery setup I am getting $196
