Oh i see here from your post to the list: 

https://spectralworkbench.org/sets/3176  UV flashlight 395nm baselines feb23 using .09mm slit
https://spectralworkbench.org/sets/3177  UV laser 405nm baselines feb23 using .09mm slit

Here's my 405nm LED test with isopropyl compared with your 395nm/isopropyl test:

Your baseline noise is higher, so it's hard to tell whether the shorter wavelength LED gets us less overlap with the visible light region we want to use in oil identification. Both seem to bottom out at around 430-450... It's hard to tell, but 395 might bottom out about 10nm earlier, which would make sense. Do you know what brand of LED they use?
