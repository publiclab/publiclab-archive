Has Medtronic been approached about this?  That should probably be the first approach.  As far as the rest of it goes... We made catheters, heart and urinary.  Some of the catheters were inflatable.  We had regulatory issues with those systems.  That's before talking about CSF.  There will definitely be many regulatory issues, as well as scientific issues, to resolve.  I admire your abilities.  Good luck.
