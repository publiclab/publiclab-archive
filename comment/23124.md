Hi! Sorry you're having trouble. My first thought is what direction are the grating lines going? They should be horizontal, or for the DVD, the edge of the disc should be at the top or bottom. 

My second thought is maybe the grating is too far from the camera? 

Also, is it possible you've not yet selected a good cross section? Try taking a picture through the webcam with a webcam app, or clicking the settings button while capturing?
