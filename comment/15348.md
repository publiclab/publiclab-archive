IANAL (I am not a lawyer), so if you get near a court proceeding, listen to the attorney who is handling the case, but...

In one of my previous lives (career-wise), I worked in and then ran the family private investigation business.  Being the techie in the business, I ended up handling most of the computer and data related issues that came up.  All of the following is anecdotal (though I've tried to read up on many of the best practices from official sources), but I hope that it helps give people an idea of what they are dealing with:

First of all, lawyers, judges, and the entire court system are generally experts in the law--not necessarily in the evidence being presented.  While this may seem to be extremely obvious, it has to be kept in mind when dealing with legal systems.  In the quote from the blog that Jeff used, it would seem obvious to you, me, and anyone else who used a spreadsheet that adding a total to a column doesn't change what the spreadsheet says.  But to an attorney (and the entire legal system), _ANY_ change to evidence (material being presented in a case) is arguably "tampering" or "altering" the evidence--even if it's merely for the purpose of clarification.

Their concern is about the "integrity" of the evidence (quotation marks are not meant for snarkiness--it's because they have a much more basic definition of integrity).  If you present a digital photograph, the first questions will be about cropping, scaling, color changes, editing software, etc--unless you can absolutely state that it came from camera XYZ (with settings a,b,c) and you did nothing but send it to the printer, there will be room for argument.  If you _did_ use some sort of editing software (say, to scale up a region of interest or outline a particular item), you better be able to present both the original image and explain exactly what was done to the photograph.  Otherwise, the integrity of the presented item is in question and it could be thrown out.

For machine-produce data (digital photography or films, spectrometry data, etc), I would recommend two things:  Always keep the originals, and learn about digital signatures.  The former allows you to create a data trail which can be used to reproduce the results (part of good laboratory practice), and digital hashes and signatures allow you to stand in front of an opposing lawyer and state that the data has not been altered because of X, Y, and Z.  And if he's going to argue that _you_ went back and changed things, he's going out on a limb unless he has some arguable proof.

For "manipulated" or analysis results, the best thing is to use standard techniques, know your systems' capabilities and limitations, and stay within what you know.  I've been following (as best I can) all the work on the spectrometry by warren, dhaffnersr, and others precisely for this reason.  I doubt that I'll ever be in a court case where spectrometry data will be the key, but some day, someone will.  And being able to state how the resolution of the equipment is affected, or how high a concentration of contaminant needs to be to show up on a spectrometer image will prove to be very important.

In those cases, following best practices (even if you're the one establishing those best practices) lends a lot of credence to your evidence.

Another thing to note in all of the above is that the evidence does not ever really speak for itself (despite all the courtroom dramas we've seen.)  In the law, it's all about the people.  Your attorney will be glad to have good evidence that supports his/her argument, but it's no good without a person to back it up by explaining exactly what was done, how the results came about, and what expertise and experience can back this up.

I hope this helped a little.  Maybe I should expand this into a separate note--I can dig up some best practices and links regarding digital and analytical evidence (court procedures, national standards, criminal procedures, etc) and try to give a laymen-peripheral-to-law interpretation that could get us started.

Even better, we could try to recruit a real attorney to the Public Lab community--someone who has experience and would be willing to put together some do's and don'ts (don't's?) on compiling lab results for court cases.
