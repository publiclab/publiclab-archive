Hi Chris!
I tested this image. Had the same results.
I them made an improvement to the older algorithm

```
 var ndvi = 255 * (b - r) / (1.00 * b + r);
```

I made it this:

```
 var ndvi = 255 * (b - r) / (1.00 * b + r);
 var x = (ndvi > 0) ? ndvi : 0;
```

Basically, it's just the old algorithm, and I map the negative values to 0;

This produced the same results as infragram. Maybe this is a unique case.

Is mapping all negative ndvi points to black correct? I really doubt that.

Can you please have a look at https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues/34#issuecomment-315081822 ?
