Hi, Liz, thank you for your feedback!!

The main problem is that the way the search is working now is really confusing, even for us! We are trying to improve it a little, but it's a big work in progress. The typeahead and the /search are not using the same API methods, for example. We are working to consolidate the search in general, to at least return more relevant or consistent results.

But one important thing to keep in mind is that if a certain result is at the top or not of results list returned, will depend on the relevance of the page.

From your feedback, we believe the search default should be the boolean mode? BUT right now what we need a more clear feedback is about the boolean or the natural mode. You will still be able to change the mode of the search, we just need to choose one as the default for now.

Take a look at some screenshots that we are still working on (above) :)))
