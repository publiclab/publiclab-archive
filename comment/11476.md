I'm in central Texas, in a rural area (county). Companies have been hitting this area hard, 3 sites within a quarter mile of each other and a small neighborhood in the middle. These are horizontal drilling operations for oil and gas. The noise is incredibly loud, the entire house vibrates to low level frequencies. I expect this to go on for some time as I have mapped permits both approved and in progress. County noise regs are geared toward firing of guns rather than low freq vibration (if I recall correctly, somewhere over 75-100 decibels in the living space is the limit).  These experiences have alerted me to the need for citizens to have some sort of evidence ...thanks to PublicLab for recognizing this! Thanks for leads on alphasense, will check those out.
