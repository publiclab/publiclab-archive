 Hi [@warren](/profile/warren) this is just a light suggestion, I'll flesh it out if you're interested. 

How about spam detection with use of machine learning algorithms. We could train our model on public lab specific spam or use something more generic (trained on general spam). Responses could be auto approved unless spam was detected prompting a review :-) I'd propose building the ML aspect using Python libraries (of which I have some experience) and integrating this with the current website.
