[@Matej](/profile/Matej) Lots of interesting things here! Anecdotally from the spill response team I work with, it only takes a few drops of oil to create a sheen, so if this is not the case, I'd like to correct that misconception!

I was also wondering about the other separation methods you're trying. In your 20:1 mixes, if you let them settle on their own, do they form two distinct layers? Is it enough in the field to skim liquid from the surface, and let gravity separate the oil samples? I'd also be interested in the result of reheating the frozen samples, even the ones that didn't visibly change as much as the recovered 05W30.

For oil spills that happen in the field, does the oil mostly remain on the surface (where at least it could be skimmed and sampled) or does it form suspensions, or sink to the bottom... or do certain types of "oil" or fluid dissolve in the water. Maybe a better question is, what gets spilled in different types of situations (bakken crude spill, gulf oil spill, industrial contaminants...) and where would you expect to find those contaminants -- on the surface, dissolved or suspended, or on the bottom? And if you are doing a general investigation, where should you sample from?
