Hi [@sakshi24](/profile/sakshi24) , really great proposal. I really like the depth of your research even including the research on Gaurav works ❤️  I like the attention to detail in your proposal 🎉 🎉 

For the Mapknitter spam dashboard we are expecting to have additional fields like images placed, total images etc maybe its something to think of how the table will look like extra fields to avoid cluttering. No need to worry about this now, you could look into this later after the Outreachy deadline.

Great proposal again. I love the in-depth explanation on your tasks, the imagery and the code snippets gives a  great picture of your plan. Also including FTOs creations we always love those ❤️  
Thanks for posting
