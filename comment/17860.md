I'm using wery old cheap webcam with all controll on manual and get same result with Logitech C525 also in manual mode.
I checked lineariti on all 3 colour, green ones with white LED and pik response is almost linear.
There is also another sign for blooming. Combination of 660n LED with 100 bit pick & white LED with 20 bit at 660nm give both together 140 bit at 660nm response of red sensor. It look like that sensor became more sensitive if they receive much light. Could you please check lineariti of your spectrometer at different level of light.
I want to found some reasonable price  monochrome usb camera, but suplier_elp on ebay told me, that all ELP b&w camera use RGB sensors.
