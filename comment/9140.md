This sketch looks good - by minimal i meant we can use just a "trash" icon for deletion, and skip buttons like "Start Upload" by just auto-starting upload on drop. Progress bar and cancel upload can just be a spinner instead of a bar and a <u>cancel</u> link. Just thinking about pixel real estate. 

A built-in sidebar could save some extra pixel space too and may be easier than a "dropdown" for showing a long list.

Another thing is that as we transition to just showing all images for your viewport, rather than having people create a map which "contains" images, the list of images may just be those currently shown in your viewport, which could update whenever you move the viewport. This does complicate ordering (which then has to be ordered in relation to any nearby image... the order index numbering would have to contain *all* images globally in MapKnitter), but we can probably put off thinking too hard about that for the time being since I don't think we have someone working on ordering. Perhaps at that time, we'd allow you to order upon assembling a set of images to export, and store just local (not global) order in the Export record. Or, we could (gasp) use decimals for order, and just allow images to be ordered with near-infinite precision, never having to "run out of integers" when ordering, the way CSS breaks down. Perhaps we could use a rough starting order # based on extent, which maps global size to some initial order decimal.

Having a clear "Drop files here" region doesn't conflict with allowing drag/drop anywhere on the window; it's a good idea to have a specific callout even if more advanced users know you can drag anywhere. When you drag over the whole screen, a fat dotted line and transparent overlay with "Drag images here to start uploading" should appear over the screen in a style which matches the dotted line around the dedicated drag/drop region. 

I like the **show/hide** toggle for each image! Also, perhaps there'd be an auto-place button on each image. At first, as it's being tested, this could be under a caret <a class="btn"><span class="caret"></span></a> menu similar to the like/follow menu on PublicLab.org research notes. Tucking more advanced (or more beta/prototype) features away can keep the interface less intimidating while making them available to more advanced users. Just a suggestion, though.
