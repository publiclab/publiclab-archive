Hi, I'd love to see a could things -- a list of what could be done and merged in in preparation -- under a prior version of Rails, so the final big change will be as compact and concise as possible! And second, can link to the Rails 4.2 upgrade PR and talk about what's left in that? It's one of the open PRs on plots2 right now. If you're interested, maybe give a try moving that PR along a bit too! 

Thanks a lot! I love your work on the graphs so far -- it's super to see your getting into our workflows and collaborating.
