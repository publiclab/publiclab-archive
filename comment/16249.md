I'm currently working out how to calibrate these oversampled thermistors to a reasonable level without breaking the bank for a high quality reference.  But life is fairly intense right now, so I probably won't get that out the door for another month or so. I will try to put more photos, etc in that.

With regards to the how to, all you have to do is connect an 85k ohm resistor from pin D5 to ground, an run the code example I included in the post. That's all there is to it if you use the pin noise technique.   When you call the asyncOversample function, change the readPin to whichever ADC input line you have the Thermistor divider on, and set extraBits to a value of 4, 5, or 6.   I did not bother configuring the code for more bits than that, because I really did not see much benefit in the data past 6 bits, and it takes a really long time to capture all those samples. In fact most of the time 256 samples (4bits) looked really good.

If you are using an UNO, I would use the triangular dither method which Qwerty outlines in great detail at the freetronics forum, so I was not going to rehash all that material.
