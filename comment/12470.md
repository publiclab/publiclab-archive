Hi I have been testing with one particular filter wich is the 116 Medium Blue Gree, because the 2007 was not available for sale at the moment. I am using a sigle camera to get NDVI, but I have no idea if I am going in the right direction. Colud you please help me out?  

Note: I took alook to the color filter thecnical data sheet, and i just came to the conclution that it looks almost as the 2007`s. This is the main reason I choose the 116. But I reaaly do not know. Here are some pictures.
