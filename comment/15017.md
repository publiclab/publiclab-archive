Cristofer,

If you replaced the camera's IR block filter with a red filter (Rosco [#19](/n/19) or Wratten 25) The blue channel should capture mostly near infrared light. Healthy foliage reflects most NIR so the blue channel should be very bright when you photograph leaves.  In your photos the blue channel is darker than the red channel. So that is not right. It might be due to the white balance setting of the camera. What was the white balance setting? Does the camera have the option for a custom white balance setting? See this page about setting the white balance: https://publiclab.org/wiki/infrablue-white-balance
