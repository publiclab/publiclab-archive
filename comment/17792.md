Thanks Jeff. That's a really interesting question. I did not include step by step instructions, so a complete novice would have to do some research to learn how I2C devices are connected to Arduinos (VCC, GND, SCL, SDA). But I linked to the tag page for the Nano Data Logger, so it's easy to find more information in the related research notes listed there. There is a [helpful pdf about the Nano Data Logger](http://kaptery.com/files/documents/nanodataloggerguide.pdf) at the KAPtery with all the critical details. I included a well-commented sketch, so it should be fairly easy to get one of these running. 

It's really easy to get one of these running if you start with the kit at the KAPtery and add three components. 

- [Nano Data Logger Kit](http://kaptery.com/product/nano-logger-kit).........$29.00 (includes BMP280 sensor)
- [16x2 LCD display](http://kaptery.com/product/addon-sensors-etc)............... $6.50
- [GY-90615 IR sensor](http://kaptery.com/product/addon-sensors-etc)............$8.00  (this is the low range sensor)
- [I2C hub](http://kaptery.com/product/accessories)................................$8.00
- Total....................................$51.50

If you order all of these parts on eBay you would spend about $30 (but you can't buy the I2C hub) and you would have to wait three or four weeks. The KAPtery items above will snap together into a working logger with no soldering, unlike the eBay parts. US shipping from the KAPtery is free and takes a few days. Customer service is pretty good when I'm not out splitting wood.
