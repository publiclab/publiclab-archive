Hi everyone - 

I posted a big update on the Open Pipe Kit project: http://publiclab.org/notes/rjstatic/07-21-2015/does-the-open-pipe-kit-lower-the-barrier-to-sensor-data-collection-we-need-your-help

> For the modern sensor, M2M/IoT, it is independentky powered entity with power management as a critical design characteristic

[@neilh20](/profile/neilh20) This was the part of the Minimum Viable Product goals of the Apitronics Wireless Platform that I helped build the Hive Gateway software for. 

> Apitronics is a wireless platform designed for the outdoors. It includes a base station, or "Hive", that coordinates a swarm of field-ready "Bees" which collect data and control switches.

Check out the [video on the Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lthiery/apitronics-wireless-platform/description). While the Open Hardware Bee board is no longer for sale, the Open Source Hive Gateway software could be used with any hardware willing to [talk Xbee to the Hive](http://wiki.apitronics.com/doku.php#configuring_xbees).  

In contrast, the Open Pipe Kit project has taken an approach to not optimize for power on our first go around, instead optimizing for other factors. See my most recent Research Note I linked to above.
