yes! a 3 way would be great, they really do moan when they get jammed. A three way or a two way that vents the non-line engaged channel would be ideal. 

Here is a wayback machine link to the Consumer Report:

They claim it didn't perform well and that the makers misrepresented a third party study in their promotional materials. 

Measuring in situ would be great as the volume that a fan can do might be deceptively enticing when pulling air through the growth medium. They may have less force than the aquarium pumps?
