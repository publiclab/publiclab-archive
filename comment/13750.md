[@warren](/profile/warren) & [@stoft](/profile/stoft) - It's important to remember that the range of fluorescent emissions is determined in large part by the excitation wavelength we use. If we are using a 405 nm laser, we are generally not going to see any light emitted below this wavelength, because emitted fluorescent light is generally going to have a lower energy (and a longer wavelength) than the light that is absorbed. Transitions where the emitted light is less energetic than the light that is absorbed are said to undergo a [Stokes Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_shift). There are exceptions to this rule, but my understanding is that they are relatively rare.

That being said, I don't see any reason to believe that the webcam's detection bandwidth is shearing off much useful spectral data below 405 nm. When you say "most oil fluorescence spectra actually extend well below 400nm," it is important to remember the role of your excitation wavelength in determining the range of a fluorescence spectrum. For evidence of this, just look at the figure from my above post. 

I still think you make a lot of good points in your note. Thanks for the details analysis, Stoft.
