Hi folks! I'm starting with the general case here, that a pi could act as a keyboard (an HID interface), for any of the above cases. I think we could have a way to cache data either in memory or on the disk, and "play it all back" -- or a continuous mode where it types data while it captures it. Imagine a pi camera that's used in a spectrometer; you could have it type the data just after it takes a picture. Or a weather station could "spit out" a week's worth of data it had stored. 

At this point I'm most interested in the general ability to virtually type, upon which we could build a range of functions. Modularity!

Thanks!
