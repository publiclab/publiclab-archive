In my community we are facing a lot of threats to water quality.   We have many existing oil and gas wells and lots of agricultural land use.  Recently there has been exploration by companies wanting to use fracking to extract more gas.  We also have an expanding number of injection wells used for disposing of brine from fracking and various other "nontoxic" fluids.  One of the injection well companies just got a permit to expand their operation by becoming a class 1 injection site.  A large number of people in the community opposed the permit, and attended the EPA public comment meetings to voice their concerns.  The EPA listened politely but granted the permit because the company met their criteria and the community couldn't provide any evidence to support their concerns and justify denying the permit.  There is a need for multi-point, longitudinal data collection in areas where these activities are taking place so changes in water quality can be shown by verifiable data.  This is the only way to impact policy.
