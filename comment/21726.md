 "The diffraction grating is not perfectly flat" would suggest you are using one of the readily available 35-mm laser holographic film gratings -- which are neither flat nor mechanically stable. If so, that alone is a severe problem. Since the diffraction effect is not a function of diffraction grating area (once a number of lines have been illuminated) consider attempting a test using only a single small area (grating and camera fixed together and then 'moved' as a unit .. if that makes sense). Alternately, try a 'CD' grating but keep the 'exposed line length short' to keep the 'arc across the spectrum' small. At least the 'CD' is flat, stable and uniform line width vs distance.
