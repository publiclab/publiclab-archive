 [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano) [@warren](/profile/warren) Thanks for bring up the testing. I did tried out testing for my React side project, but since I am new to Rails, I haven't look into their testing libraries yet. Look forward to checking out the link! As for the mockup and plans for controller implementation, I was planning to do so each time the reviewed for a previous project ends and a major milestone get start. I will add it in the timeline.
I did notice both the post have the same id number ( [#17462](/n/17462)), so I was hesitate about deleting it too.
