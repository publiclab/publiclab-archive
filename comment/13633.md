I am using 2 raspberry Pis (one camera on each) and I synchronize the shutters using interrupts. 
I had some strange behavior (one Pi taking more picture than the other one) but it's negligible: 2 more pictures in a set of 200.
My concern is more about image quality (quite poor with the VIS) and the reliability of the results. The Pi Noir seems good but I still have some doubt. 
Now that Carnaval has ended (everything stop during Carnaval in Brazil ... :( ) I will try to speak with the people of the university of agronomy and make some test with them. 
I'll continue to post the results of my test here. 
My next steps will be to check the calibration and make some test with the filter you mentioned.
did you know if the Wratten 87 is included with the filter pack sold by public lab?
