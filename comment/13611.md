Hey :-)
What about the sheens reminded you of coal tar vs. oil?
- they were little bit different color. kind of more "metallic and dense" if that makes sense. 

We collected them with our newly acquired Coast Guard Oil Collection Kit. (small net on the picture below)
Was this successful? Did you see oil in the net, and how much did you have to skim? Was it hard, and what was it like to get the oil out of the net?
- Yes! there was clearly visible sheen caught in the net. I have to dry that and we will soak it in mineral oil.
I skimmed quite a lot, just in case, but the sheen was visible in the net pretty quickly. It really helps if the boat is moving because the sheen just "flows" into the net.
