In some cases we might want to feature people not because they've been most active, but because the best embody the idea of Public Lab - collaborative work on environmental issues! So, in theory we might manually curate these (how might we do this? Profile tags?) and we might also brainstorm how else to feature people!

Ah, take a look at our simplified questions form here, which could be adapted for this use, and retain some rich text features but be even simpler! https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/master/app/views/editor/questionRich.html.erb

> Recommended questions

How might we calculate a query to get "Recommended questions"? good idea!

People page - could the map be touching the top navbar and go full width, instead of having margins? 

Search results page -- wow! Very cool!!! 

Thanks Isha!
