Hello everyone!I'm Liang Ting and I am a student from School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University. I am looking for opportunity to take part in Public Labs 2019 GSOC. I am interested in working on the Image Sequencer project.  I would like to  help to let it have better performance. Learned Multithread, multiprocess programming, and CUDA, I had participated in ASC19 and tried to do some optimization on software. And I have learned about javascript and nodejs before. I see that in the Image Sequencer now,  it does not contain much optimization, and the developers want to use webworker and gpu.js to make it work more smoothly. I think I can contribute to it.
