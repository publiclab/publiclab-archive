Thank you @ bansal_sidharth2996 ! 

For maps-layer JS library , i was thinking of making independent modules like :  
1.) `Layers`  module .

2.)  `Full-Screen` module 

3.) `Near-By projects` module 

4.) `Near-By people` module 

5.) And a Main-Module whose instance will be made . 

    We will take arguments as the URL of the API , and maybe URL of markers png image  , and number of markers to be displayed  , security options , etc . in above modules . 

Also including features like ( **Using Leaflet library (i have some initial implementation for these)** ):
  
  *  Refresh Map on panning and zooming 

  *  Finite Scrolling and panning of maps

  *  Location - Security


** CODE FLOW / STEPS  : **

1.) Creating src , dist , test and example folder . 

2.) Creating independent modules in *src* folder . 

3.) Creating example HTML files in example folder to test different map modules .

4.) Using `Jasmine` framework for testing to be put in *test* folder .

5.) Using `gruntJS` plugins for concatenating and compressing modules into one single JS file .

6.) Publishing the library to `npm` . 

7.) For increasing code - maintainability and usability , we can use : https://coveralls.io/ and https://travis-ci.org .

8.) Integrating with plots2 .

**I was thinking of starting the work before the actual coding period starts like from 24 April as i am already a contributor for PublicLab from a long-time , hence skipping the *community-bonding period exercise* , only if you all agree with this :)**

What do you think [@warren](/profile/warren) ?
