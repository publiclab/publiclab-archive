This looks very promising. 

There are a couple of controls that might add a lot to the interpretability of your tests. 
1) With the water bottle in air instead of in the beaker of coffee water. So clean air should not scatter any light back to the detector.
2) As above and with the outside of the water bottle covered in black tape or black felt. So no LED light should be able to reach the sensor. This tests if the sensor picks up electronic noise or maybe light leaking through the baffle or light travelling laterally through the clear plastic of the water bottle. 

How much will the color of the turbid suspended sediment influence the readings? Will whitish silt give similar readings to dark organic suspended soil? Will green algal blooms register the same as gray silt? Just curious.
