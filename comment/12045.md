Hi Agustin,

The formula you wrote is what I use. I typically use the PhotoMonitoring plugin which can be found here: https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin but you can also use the Infragram web site:http://infragram.org/. The Infragram web site would be an easy way to test subtracting blue from red before calculating NDVI. 

When I am creating NDVI form JPEG images I typically do not compensate for the NIR energy recorded by the red detectors but when I calibrate the images I do. For calibration I subtract some of the blue band (e.g. 80%) from the red band before calculating NDVI. The  PhotoMonitoring plugin doesn't have this capability yet but I plan to add functionality to the plugin for calibrating before calculating NDVI and that will have an option to subtract some or all of the blue band from the red band. I have a research note in the works that explains my plan and I hope to post that in the next few days. Good luck. Ned
