MapKnitter Image Management:
 "This project idea focuses on the systems for tracking changes on those images, collecting them into sets, storing image history...."

Regarding this, I'm thinking

- An onclick display of image history ( past versions of the image clicked )
- Ability to revert back to previous versions.

- Timeline view of a map.
( If we set a time, it will show all the versions of images as it was at that time )
