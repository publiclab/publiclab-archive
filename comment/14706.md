Wow, great work.  Sorry that there's so much trouble dealing with drivers for this USB-Serial chip!

Re: the capacitive sensor circuit ... do you still have the breadboarded circuit set up as per the picture above, and it still generating an audio output?  If so, you can try using this code here:

https://gist.github.com/dwblair/cdd621f624397341afcd190ef6bd0242

This is datalogging code for measuring the frequency of the circuit output (i.e. getting a number in Hertz, instead of just getting audio output).  

In general, the code is set up to measure the frequency using pin 3 on the Riffle.  So, you'd connect the Riffle pin 3 to the same row as the audio output on the breadboard.

And, re: power -- some of the 555 timer chips used in the workshop required 4.5 volt input.  Can you read off the letters/numbers on the 555 timer IC, and we can see if this was one of those?
