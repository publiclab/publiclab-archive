Fantastic work! I'd be happy to help add some other sensors to this project if you are interested. I've created an Arduino clone that plugs in to Raspberry Pi, that our group could probably donate for experimentation. 

It can:
   Easily integrate analog or digital sensors (temperature, air quality, altitude, etc.)
   interface servos directly so if you have a tilt platform it could be used for that as well.
