If you have a normal color photo and an NIR photo of the exact same scene, you can use the [Photo Monitoring plugin for Fiji](https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/01-13-2016/packaged-photo-monitoring-plugins-available-on-the-github-repositoy). The Github repository has full instructions for making NDVI or false color IR images.
