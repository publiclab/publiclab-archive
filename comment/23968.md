 This looks very interesting. I'm currently doing research within the same area https://publiclab.org/notes/petter_mansson1/04-09-2019/low-cost-ndvi-analysis-using-raspberrypi-and-pinoir

Maybe we could schedule some kind of meeting/event and discuss ideas. Would be nice if we could use the calendar on this site so that people with interest could join as well.
