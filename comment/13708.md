Ah, excellent, excellent, but it's my understanding that the plastic LEDs like that aren't typically as bright as the surface mounted flat LEDs I'm using here: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-05-2016/testing-high-brightness-405nm-leds-in-fluorescence-spectroscopy-of-oils

Sorry to ask again, but do you know how to identify LEDs as bright as these?
