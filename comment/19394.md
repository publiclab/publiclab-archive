^^ interesting! A whole new angle on this problem. I think I would actually do this first to see the results coming out of the sensor, whether or not i proceed to setting up a datalogger. I went to http://freeware.the-meiers.org/, scrolled down, and downloaded the CoolTerm version for Mac. Can the sensor be connected to the laptop via the same kind of audio cable? Will there be anything to type on the command line?
