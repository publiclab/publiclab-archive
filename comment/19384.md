Liz, I don't know the specs of the 1/4" phone plug, but it needs only two contacts, the tip and one ring along the shaft. I'm not sure which types of plugs will work (some have more than one ring). That plug terminates a cable with at least two wires in it. The wires from the tip of the plug and from one ring must be exposed and connected to pins on the Arduino.
