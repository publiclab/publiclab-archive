Have you looked at data from EPA's AMTIC (Ambient Monitoring Technology Air Monitoring Information Center)? I am assuming you are from the United States?

The EPA has a national ambient air quality network that monitors critical pollutants such as ground-level ozone and pm 2.5, for instance. They are sporadically located, but offer critical information to AQ researchers and the public.

AMTIC landing page: [https://www.epa.gov/amtic](https://www.epa.gov/amtic) You might need to spend some time to delve into the program site page to find what you are looking for.
