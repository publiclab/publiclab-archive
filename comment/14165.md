The Photo Monitoring plugin allows any band (R,G,B) to be used as the visible band (VIS). With the Mapir camera, all three bands from the RED camera capture only red light, so any one can be used. Although all three bands are red light, they are not always equally bright. So you can choose one which is much less bright than the NIR band from the other camera and the NDVI values will be in the right ballpark. This process is obviously very crude unless calibration is done.

The Photo Monitoring plugin does not display the lut with the NDVI image. This has to be done manually.
