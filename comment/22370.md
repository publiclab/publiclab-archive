I also wanted to note that folks may be left with a photo series, not a video -- like with the [#timelapse](/tag/timelapse) trail cameras folks. While we have a question open for converting that into a video, we also need a solution for just storing a big batch of photos. 

I'm curious if MapMill can work for this? It may have some issues with uploading really huge batches of images, but perhaps we can try to resolve those bugs and see if this can work?

Also, just to acknowledge that storing large image sets is just a tough problem -- many big companies (flickr, etc) struggle to provide a great level of service for that sort of thing.
