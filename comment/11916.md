Yikes. You never did like Picavets did you? I can see that the relationship is not moving in a positive direction. One of you two needs to start showing more respect for the other. After three years of practice with Picavets, last summer I had to cut the line off and re-lace it in the field on two separate occasions. It does not take much for a tangle to start. 

Your observation is astute -- this rig has a lot of moving parts. Much preparation and planning is required to get everything working together. I will give an award to anyone who produces a half-spherical panorama on their first flight of a Saturn V Rig with SkyShield. For Pat, his second flight will count. I already failed on my first attempt.

Respect the Picavet,
Chris
