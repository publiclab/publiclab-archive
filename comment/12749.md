Hi Kiran,

The Pi NOIR camera does not have an IR block filter (NOIR = no IR). So it is a full spectrum camera. That means some NIR is captured in each of the three channels (R,G,B) along with visible light of one color.The plant leaves in your photos are light because much NIR is reflecting from them and being captured by the camera. If you look at each channel, they will all look similar.

Infrared plant health images usually highlight the difference between NIR reflected from leaves and visible light reflected from leaves. But in your photos NIR and visible is mixed. DIY plant health cameras start with a full spectrum camera and then add a filter that blocks all visible light of one color. Then one of the channels (R,G,B) will not capture any visible light and will only capture NIR light. NDVI-like images could then highlight the difference between that channel and a visible light channel.

Public Lab sells filters that can turn a PI NOIR camera into a plant health camera.
