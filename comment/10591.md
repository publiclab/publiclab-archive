Thanks [@amysoyka](/profile/amysoyka)! That's really interesting. Do you know if lactic acid is known to break down formaldehyde and that the outputs of that breakdown would be? I guess the benifit of a bacteria over an acid would be that a bacteria and reproduce, where as the user would have to replace the acid eventually. but replacing acid could be easier than feeding bacteria. 

Following your microbe wiki link to their P. putida page and they noted that the bacteria, while certified as safe *may* be related to some small human pathogenesis. It would be good to look into this more as we wouldn't want to replace a chemical toxicant with a bacterial toxin, especially as many users will likely be immunologically vulnerable.
