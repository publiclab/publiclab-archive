Per an EPA alumni in our volunteer network: see BLM reg 3802.4-1 noncompliance: https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/CFR-2008-title43-vol2/CFR-2008-title43-vol2-sec3802-4-1. See also Chapter 9: Inspection and Enforcement, of the BLM Surface Management Handbook: https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/H-3809-1.pdf.
