This is pretty amazing Chris, how do you see it being useful for farmers? It seems to me that this could be useful to people interested in mapping Hydrogen Sulfide or other gas concentrations as the addition of typology could give a clue as to why you have differing concentrations of Hydrogen Sulfide in a given area. Also it might be helpful to develop a step by step how to guide for this? Exciting work!
