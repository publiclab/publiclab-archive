Ah. I get the "run" part now. The publisher of the procedure probably has some data associated to the procedure. The data generated when the procedure is run would store as a copy, and tagged to the user. Am I on the correct path?

I thought the inline capture is simple, more so with the API coming up. But yes, this could be resorted to at the later stage. Popping up has better UX than redirection, don't you think?
