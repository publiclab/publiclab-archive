This is a well-researched proposal [@ajitmujumdar25999](/profile/ajitmujumdar25999). Thank you for sharing. I like the breakdown of the Dashboard approach and the re-use of the existing infrastructure.

I wanted to know more about the kind of tests you intend to add...functional, unit, system? I like the sandbox idea, will it need additional maintenance after the project is complete?

Thanks again, and all the best!
