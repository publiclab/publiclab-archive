Chris, I pointed out that MicMac seems to be the only OS software with built-in orthorectification functionality, but there are some other options too:

There is [a post on the ATOR blog](http://arc-team-open-research.blogspot.com/2013/12/from-drone-aerial-pictures-to-dem-and.html) (developers of python photogrammetry toolbox) on using [GRASS](http://grass.osgeo.org/) to georectify point clouds.  It LOOKS easy.  

There is also a [DIY Drones thread](http://diydrones.com/forum/topics/aerial-image-processing-software-and-workflows?x=1&id=705844%3ATopic%3A1535147&page=2#comments) on this topic, and they mention the ATOR blog's PPT/GRASS workflow and MicMac as well. And also the [free trial version of Pix4D Mapper](https://mapper.pix4d.com/mapper/trial/1/)
