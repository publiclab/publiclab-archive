I have done a lot of water quality analysis work using double beam UV/V spectrophotometer to determine phosphates, nitrates, nitrates, ammonia using standard methods. I will get your desk spectrophotometer kit and compare against Hitachi U-2000 (double beam UV/V spectrophotometer) and Hach DR-2000(single beam V spectrophotometer) and see how it compares. Most of these methods have been adapted to use for school and concern environmental groups and as screen or even bench mark tests are quite suitable. It certainly will require chemicals to react and produce colours that can be measured by the desktop spectrophotometer.
This could be a way to use a calibrated spectrophotometer. "Lab community are still using light bulbs for absorption spectroscopy, and many new spectrometer makers are not sure what to do once they've calibrated their spectrometer." It would certainly require a lot of adjustments. Well is just a thought.
