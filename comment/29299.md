Hi, we are working on getting support to do continued debugging and refinement of Spectral Workbench via the Outreachy program and hope to make some progress in the coming months. In the meantime I've documented this bug here: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/issues/738

Thank you for reporting!
