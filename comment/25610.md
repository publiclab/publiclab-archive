I am curious about how this will help make shipping safer. I have extensive experience in ship traffic management and this project sounds interesting along the lines of safety. What are your thoughts on how detecting bioluminescence can help ships' pilots avoid accidents?
My own thought is that if bioluminescence is stimulated by the passing of a ship (which I think may be true, based on very limited observations), then a bioluminescence detector placed at the edge of a shoal area (near a ship channel) might send a signal to a ship-board receiver to let the ship's pilot/captain know that the vessel is getting close to the shoal.
