The demo site looks great. I'm eager to see how we might test out scheduled-sending emails in a 'test mode' before bringing the entire system online. Maybe an email that's sent only to me, hard-coded in, or just to users who have a certain user tag? Then we can bring online the more complete system piece by piece. 

Can you discuss with [@icarito](/profile/icarito) about the queuing backend? It makes sense that it's a good idea, and we should think through how to deploy it, etc. -- would it live in our GitHub project? Would it run on the same container?

Instead of `email_reply` let's add a `source` to the `comment` model. Then we can in the future think about other sources too -- maybe Twitter!

What if the user sends from the wrong email? Could we respond with an email that says "we don't recognize this email -- click here (publiclab.org/profile) to add another email to your profile" and have a button for that? We could store it as a hidden user tag, maybe? not sure.

`receive_mail` might be named `Comment.from_email` maybe? I like your idea there!

One more -- `send_digest` -- could that just be a method of User? So, `user.send_digest(nodes)` maybe?

Thanks for thinking this through so deeply!
