I actually only made a search of "HD pinhole camera" on eBay and found a long list of candidates:

http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=pinhole+HD+camera&_sacat=0&_odkw=pinhole+HD+USB+camera&_sop=15&_osacat=0

Some have a very good resolution, but the specs lack sizes of the CMOS/CCD chip and if they use lenses. Anyway, I take it for certain that all use some kind of a cheap plastic lens. 
I wonder if there is a way I could measure the absorption of these lenses, or find documentation on just that subject online...
