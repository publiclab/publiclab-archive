Another approach to this problem would be essentially what Drager does.  We could construct a manual vacuum pump.  It would essentially be like a bicycle pump but with the valves reversed and a spring to return the plunger.  We know the Kitagawa 710 Formaldehyde tube requires 300ml/min×30min which is a volume of 9,000ml or 9 liters.  If the vacuum pump moves 1 liter per stroke then it takes 9 strokes over 30 minutes.  The vacuum pump could have an orifice so the spring would slowly push the plunger out.  Clear indications that the plunger has been fully pressed and fully returned would be needed.  A mechanical counter could be used to count the strokes or a place on the DIY Formaldehyde Test Photo Card could be used to make tick counts.  Some big advantages are that both the electrical pump and the flow meter are not needed.  

I just found an Instructable that is SIMILAR to what I am describing: http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-High-Volume-Manual-Vacuum-Pump/
