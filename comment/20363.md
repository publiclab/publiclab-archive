Hi [@jywarren](/profile/jywarren) !

The documentation you are looking for is at [here](https://publiclab.gitlab.io/image-builder-rpi/).

The actual build script is at https://github.com/publiclab/image-builder-rpi/

I made a first attempt with this [PR](https://github.com/publiclab/image-builder-rpi/pull/12)!

Should be a start!
Thanks for your work [@MaggPi](/profile/MaggPi)!
