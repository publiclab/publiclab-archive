Thanks Jack,
In its simplest form, I need to set a voltage (2.2v) and keep it there for an extended period of time but in more elegant forms, being able to pulse the system with a reverse polarity for a fixed period. 
I should also ask, what are the voltage / current limits of this potentiostat?  If necessary, can they simply be extended? (Or is this limit simply in the supplied/reference sources)

Doug
