Hey Donblair - you've got some great posts. 
The above was from my experience - working with designing a simple water level measurement device.  
Real-world issues are some of the hardest to deal with, and its why the initial instruments can be expensive.
For conductivity and light based underwater measurements, unfortunately the biofilms issue is a challenge. Some designs have used a brush wiping across the sensors before use, and other instruments have a jet of compressed air across the active area of the sensor. Maybe there are other options that can be thought about.
