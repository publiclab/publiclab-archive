Thanks Warren for the advice. I searched a bit on internet and I think its important that the silver salt crystal to be of sub micron size to get satisfactory results. This is possible with good quality film. 
Shooting such fine lines would require Laser interference pattern right? I wonder if a DVD writer could be hacked to shine straight grooves into the film?
