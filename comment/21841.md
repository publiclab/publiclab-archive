 This is so great! I'll have to give this a shot. To work with a blank (looking) background in Mapknitter you can select the Open Street Map layer and then zoom in until you've zoomed past any labeled features, (if you do this over the ocean or rural area you won't have to click as many times). You can get a beige-ish (over land) or blue (over water) background this way. You can delete the latitude and longitude info, unless you'd like to try to match your location info with the place where your sample was collected or your own location. 

If you zoom all the way on the satellite view you end up with kind of blurred grid, but if you prefer a grey background you can zoom in on Open Street Map and then toggle over to the satellite view-- then you just get a blank grey background instead of the blurred photo.

Update: can't delete the Lat/Lon, which means these will end up geographically located to SOMEWHERE.
