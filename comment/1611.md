I probably won't have chance to try this for some time  because of other things going on right now, but the first thing I could do is see what the teflon tape absorption spectrum looks like.
I am not sure how readily I can calculate or find the the solar spectrum as a function of sun altitude, but as I recall right now, I have data on the solar spectrum at a specific altitude.  So, folks could wait for the sun to be at that specific altitude and make their measurements at that time. (People at high latitudes might have longer to wait to see the sun at the specific altitude.)
