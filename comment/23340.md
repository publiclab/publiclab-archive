Thx Alahna for the post!  I downloaded some Mar 20th New Orleans satellite imagery  and posted to mapknitter.

(https://mapknitter.org/maps/satellite-imagery) 

Is this type of image  useful for the water monitoring effort? If so, please provide address(es) of areas of interest and I may be able to post them for review.....
