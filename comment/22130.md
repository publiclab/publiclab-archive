 Hi, i really like these! It might be interesting for you to skim some of the most recent comments on these posts: https://publiclab.org/tag/ui for some context about our UI process. But there are lots of nice aspects of your designs that would be great to dig into! 

I especially like the profile picture bigger on the notes page mockup, and lots of other small details. 

What if the notes/posts stayed with a white background, but the wiki pages had the white block design on a (by default?) light grey background?
