> Laser,detector and currette should form a straight line

I think this setup would be a problem because the laser light is VASTLY more powerful than any fluorescence, and the camera sensor would probably be destroyed (just as an eye would!), or at least not sense anything besides the laser. 

Looking at your photos, I think the laser alignment issue may be due to the OTK frame being mis-assembled; take a look at this image for reference:

See how your laser and slit are not set up the same way? The narrow slit pointing upwards in yours should be aligned so that the light passes through it on the way to the slit. Read more and look closely at the images here, especially in the comments:
