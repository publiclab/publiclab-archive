Krylon extra flat black spray paint is diffuse and spectrally flat across the vis-nir. A small sheet of teflon isn't too expensive and works great (it isn't a coating but it's easy to clean), except for the cheap teflon sold on Amazon - it's not spectrally flat. I currently have access to a spectroradiometer and a calibrated spectralon panel so I can record reflectance curves from 350-2500nm for any inexpensive coating you think might work well.
