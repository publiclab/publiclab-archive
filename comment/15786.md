Hello Ned,

I have calculated ndvi using following code in matlab, using single camera without white balancing:

red_orig = imread('IMG_RED.TIF');
nir_orig = imread('IMG_NIR.TIF');
red = im2double(red);
nir = im2double(nir);
ndvi = (nir - red)./(nir + red);

Suppose I'm having reflectance Kr and Kn of RED and NIR band respectively in percentage (80% both), and also having average pixel value for RED and NIR, Vr and Vn respectively.

Now how can I incorporate these for calculating the true NDVI in the equation?

Please help me with this. Thanks a lot.
