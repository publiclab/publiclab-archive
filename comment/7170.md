The NDVI image looks pretty good to me, but I don't know much about your process or expectations. Fill us in and we might be able to help ([guidelines here](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/07-17-2013/infrablue-minutiae)). Also, There might be more interested eyes looking at the [plots-infrared discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plots-infrared), where it is easier for respondents to add images, etc. 

It looks like the arbors are lower NDVI than the paths between them (but I am guessing about your color mapping). Is that what you would expect?
