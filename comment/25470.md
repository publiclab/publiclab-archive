I've come back to this after doing a bit more research on the subject.
First as the device has sensitive op-amps which are exposed I have put an electrical shield over the component board. This has removed the large spikes in the data.
Second in order to get PM 2.5 values I need to get the concentration of particles <2.5 um. So as there are two channels >2.5 um and >1.0um
taking the >2.5 channel from the >1.0 channel should give an idea of the particles which have size from 1.0 um to 2.5 um (all detectors have a cut-off at some lower value - which often the datasheet does not mention. The rather more expensive Sensiron SPS30 has one of the best cut-offs at 0.3 um).
So here is the output for about 9 days. I have also "damped" the response digitally to make the graph less "spikey". The large peak starting Sunday into Monday is due to a Sahara dust event.
The y-axis is ug/m3
