If the original Snowy Sky CFL is calibrated by pinning down the 436 nm and 546 nm peaks (using a macro) it looks like this:

Most of the peaks do not match with their known wavelengths.
If the 436 nmm and 611 nm peaks are used it looks like this:

Those two pinned peaks are farther apart and should allow for better calibration. I think on average the match with known peaks is closer, but only a couple of peaks other than the pinned ones match within a nm. So a non-linear correction like the third order polynomial seems to be required to make the major peaks of this spectrum line up with reality:
