Can you post one of your RAW images? I looked at Image1.dng and that shows the Bayer pattern so it needs to go through a debayer process to create an RGB image. I assume the Matlab script is doing that. It's quite possible that the RGB order that you are using is not the correct order for your camera sensor. The ImageJ script I use I need to specify the first four pixels in the image. Most of my images were R-G-R-G and after looking at your image my first guess would be that your images have the same order since the upper left pixel is bright.
