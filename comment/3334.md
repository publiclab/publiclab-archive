I captured a street lamp about 150 yards away using a webcam with a DVD-R+ taped over the lens without a slit. I used a 4" magnifying glass to focus the streetlight on the camera lens. The camera still needed to be aimed at a 45 degree angle away form the light source. The image is far from perfect, no focus or calibration was done, but it shows promise.
