Hi there - a bit late on the thread, hope this goes through to Mustapha.

My name is Elad Orian and I run an Israeli Palestinian organisation providing basic energy services to off-grid Palestinian communities (www.comet-me.org). We have more then a decade of experience building all kind of island systems with solar, wind and Gensets.
I would love to help so if you are interested please reach out to zapatavive@gmail.com.

Cheers,
elad.
