Hi, [@ryzokuken](/profile/ryzokuken) - this looks great. I still feel you could link more clearly to https://github.com/publiclab/plotsbot/#submitting-behaviors -- i love that section! Looking good though. Thanks, and is there perhaps a "wishlist" of behaviors people have suggested over time that we could provide as well?
