During a quick chat with [@mimiss](/profile/mimiss), we discussed how a clicking sound speeding up or slowing down is used by Geiger counters. Using a blinking light whose speed varies to show concentration could make the SAS a bit more accessible for some, but I'm not sure

Would most people find it easier to infer a high or low concentration from a color along a spectrum, or the speed of blinking? I think blinking could potentially show a wider range of values, and you could count them while watching a clock to get a numeric value from it. It might also work better in different lighting conditions.
