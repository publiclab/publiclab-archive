Mathew - Have you been able to find a reflectance plot for those paints? I looked but didn't see it. Other paints I was looking at a couple years ago had plots but only for the visible range. It's important to know the spectral reflectance properties into the NIR and having some assurance that it's stable over time and consistent from batch to batch would be nice too.
