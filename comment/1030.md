Sorry, i should've been more specific. It printed each surface, instead of treating my model like a volumetric shape. So the multiple square "tubes" above are actually the inside and outside surfaces of my model, printed as separate parts. The other photo shows that the recessed area to hold a DVD-R slice and attach to a phone is filled in completely solid, rendering it pretty useless. I cut it out and used the flange alone.
