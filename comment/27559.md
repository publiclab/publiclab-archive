Hi [@fionaodoboh](/profile/fionaodoboh) - thank you!!! This is looking great. I wonder if you might come around to creating the new dashboard route and template earlier than week 6 -- I've seen your work so far and it seems you'd for sure be up to it earlier if you wanted. My thought is that you might want to make a very simple first version of it, and progressively/iteratively expand upon it by adding more and more. That way you can gradually add tests, refine the code, etc. It'll all be at "/dashboard2" until it's ready, anyways, so you won't be breaking any old functionality! What do you think?

Thanks for your proposal!
