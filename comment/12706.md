Hi Gretchen,
Really interesting project which you should be able to generate some very interesting metals data with the WheeStat.  I have been working with potentiostats/voltammeters for many years and although I have not used this particular instrument, there are official EPA methods for Lead and Arsenic by voltammetry (you can also add zinc, cadmium, and copper to the lead scan - arsenic is run seperately) which the WheeStat should be able to analyze in the sub-ppm range.  I would also suggest looking into the EPA SW-846 for leachate digestion methods - but using vinegar from the local market should work just as well.  If I can be of any help please let me know.
