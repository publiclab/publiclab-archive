While there will be some variation between individual lamps, even the spectra of one sample, taken with a commercial spectrometer, would be useful; and hopefully confirming. The Solux halogen lamp of interest is the 4700K; the only Solux model with a smooth, broad-spectrum response. If you find one to measure, allow 5+ minutes warm-up for stability. Thanks for your interest and support. -Dave
