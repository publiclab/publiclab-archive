The divide function is the real meat and potatoes of the image warping. The Warper library is certainly helpful.

A quick mathematical review of what Warper does for us. It creates a mapping from homogenous coordinates (used to simplify projective transform calculations) to cartesian coordinates (the x and y of the original image). The homogenous coordinates are defined on the "unit square" for the mathematics implemented in divide, and the homogenous coefficient w is set to 1 in all cases.

The divide function breaks down the large image into smaller subimages. The subimages are broken down further until a very small rectangular selection is chosen. An affine transform of that small section is performed using graphics libraries (Canvas in this case). Although each maximally divided piece of the image has an affine transform, when the pieces are put together, the result approximates a discretized projective distortion.

This comment is a summary of what Anish and I came to realize after looking over the maths together. Maybe it will help others.

Anish and I agree that the Warper library needs more documentation.
