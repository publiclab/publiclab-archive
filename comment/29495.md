I think if you got closer in white balance in pre-configuring the GoPros, you can probably un-boost the blue channel some more and get better distinction in the tree pixels. But yeah, not every camera is ideal for this technique, depending on a lot of factors! 

I'm curious, did you remove the IR filter from this?
