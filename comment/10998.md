Hi, [@geraldmc](/profile/geraldmc) - I guess I have a slight preference for using PublicLab.org wikis, but I'm relatively agnostic. I tend to think that putting more documentation and assets in our own ecosystem will encourage people to live in it, and also consolidate our open sourcingness somewhat. Fewer platforms can be nice. But I don't feel super strongly about it. Maybe [@liz](/profile/liz) has some thoughts?
