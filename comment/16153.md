I have replicated the design using the printer in my local library as well as the modification to the Life cam where I removed the IR cut filter. I also discovered  that the lens can and should be refocused manually to sharpen the image after removing the IR cut filter. The grating was mounted onto the cam itself. I found that the cuvette holder was a bit too small and had to grind the hole with a miniature flat file. The printed slit was ca 0.28 mm and replaced with the 0.08 mm from PLAB store. The cam itself seems to get noticeably warmer, probably due to the autofocus circuitry causing a significant rise in the dark current.. The spectra can be seen with sun sky tags and Cam5  nIR titles. https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/99613#
