This page from Penn State has a great summary of natural gas activity indicators, their expected levels in areas with natural gas drilling, and relevant regulations on their limits:
https://extension.psu.edu/common-water-test-parameters-related-to-natural-gas-drilling

You have already identified a lot of the most important indicators. Core indicators are conductivity / total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO). Secondary indicators are barium, strontium, sulfates, nitrates, phosphates, iron, manganese, chloride. Testing for volatile organic compounds like methane would also be of interest.

The page lists surfactants and BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl- benzene and Xylene) as indicators, but even in a location with a known high location of fracking, there were rarely detectable levels in the water. This suggests that while it would be satisfying to communicate the direct causal link between oil/gas activity and direct detection of such contaminants, it might not actually be that common or cost effective.

Fractracker Alliance also has a good page on water parameters:

"In the event that a 'core' indicator suggests possible contamination due to extraction impacts, monitoring groups often run additional tests on their samples using secondary indicators to pinpoint the source of the problem." So we can test broadly for the core indicators, which are generally easier and less expensive to test for anyways, and do follow up testing in relevant cases.

The Fractracker Alliance also notes that visual and biological indicators can be useful for assessing natural gas activity's impact on water:
Visual Indicators: Visual monitoring is an important aspect of observing water quality impacts. Observations of road erosion, sedimentation, methane bubbling, and other habitat disruption can often provide warning signs of watershed impacts not detected in quantitative measurements.
Biological Indicators: Macroinvertebrate monitoring is the study of biological organisms present in a stream. “Macros” such as insects, crayfish, worms, and clams can be very sensitive to subtle water quality changes and are therefore good indicators of a stream’s overall ecological health."
