[@mathew](/profile/mathew) That heart shaped object is the abrasive chip.  When [@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) and I did my first measurement Nick said the scoring chip should be in the box but I could not find it.  Days later I was inspecting the box and out came the scoring device.  It was apparently stuck in the box because of the little zip lock bag.  So completely empty the box.
My friend found this needle valve for $10: http://www.mscdirect.com/product/details/03005089?src=pla&cid=PLA-Google-PLA+-+Test&CS_003=7867724&CS_010=03005089

[@DavidMack](/profile/DavidMack) I think the driving forces are cheap and accurate which are conflicting requirements.  That makes the users proficiency important.  Vertical orientation, reading at the meniscus/ball center, accurate timing, no leaks all will be important.  
I think there is no need for a filter since the measurement tube will filter any particles.
