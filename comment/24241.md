 I think what you want will be called a barometer.  It is what drones use to measure altitude.  They are not super expensive, here is one for $6.70.  You will have to be able to make a board to interface with an Arduino or something similar and be able to code it.  Sparkfun may have a breakout.  There are a number of ten-degrees of freedom (10DOF) motion sensors that incorporate a barometer for altitude measurement.
