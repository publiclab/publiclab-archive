Just word of caution if someone is planning to convert his Canon IXUS 132 in to NIR or NGR.

I own a Canon IXUS 132 and done the infrablue convention a few days ago.
It has similar internal constructions and layout as the Canon A2500 and I have encountered similar issues with dismantling of the camera and installing my [#2007](/n/2007) infrablue filter.

Special care must be taken when you reassemble the camera not to pinch or damage the electrical ribbons. Unfortunately I did not come across this useful webpage before I did my convention so it took me about 4 hours to complete this exercise by trial and error. 

After doing the White Balance adjustments I started to take some infrablue/NIR photos.
I realised that all my photos were blurry and out of focus. I tried playing around with the Automatic /manual focus adjustments but still can not get to focus properly. The only time it focus and produce a clear picture is when I zoom closer to an object about 10 to 20m away.

Can someone explain this or advise me on this..?
