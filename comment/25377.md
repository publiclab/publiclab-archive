Isha I am glad to see the progress you made. I remember the initial pr stage in which we were discussing the designs and then my internship started so I was not able to help you much that time.
The designs for plots are AWESOME. Alignment is awesome. I can guarantee that people will love using the plots which you introduced.
Superb progress Isha. Well done.

The gifs are great and explain me most of the article in a decent way. 
Here are a few suggestions:
Please crop the gifs so that it will not show the screen recorder dialog box and notifications of chat with Jeff. 
I am just concerned about this small thing as your blog will be read by 1000+ students aiming at SoC 20.
Also, your flow chart are awesome. Just a small suggestion, read about UML diagrams like sequence diagrams specially and try to incorporate them in the design discussion from the next time. They are universally accepted and easily understandable as different shapes convey different meanings.
thanks Isha for selecting PL for GSOC 2019 project. We are delighted to have you this year.
