I'm making a simple spectrometer to extract the spectral response curves of an imaging sensor. To this end I made some calculations to help me designing the grating configuration. I thought this might be of use to some.

Using the equations as mentioned by straylight and [here](http://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=1123#e42a503e-ff97-45d0-9b84-312574e582f0-1123) I put together a graph crossing incident angle and wavelength in function of diffraction angle (for different grating densities).

The results for a 300 lines/mm grating and a DVD 1351 lines/mm are listed below. I hope this helps in getting a feel of diffraction characteristics as discussed in the post. It clearly shows increasing non linearity across the spectrum with increasing number of lines. The middle of the spectrum (of interest) is marked with a vertical line. The horizontal line marks the angle at which the middle of the spectrum is orthogonal to the grating.

For those familiar with R ask me the script to generate these figures, markdown doesn't handle it inline very well.
