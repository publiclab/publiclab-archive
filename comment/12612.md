Hello Jorge ,
First of all, Thank you and sorry for the delay in responding ! Unfortunately with the Mobius I only did a few tests . I decided then to switch to a Canon because I believe that the Mobius ( for this type of transformation ) has " large " limits in the lenses and the same number in the sensor . Besides the white balance always it requires a connection to a laptop or PC and this , in the field, can complicate life . For the rest , the answer to Chris , is definitely what you need to know !
If you need more details , please ask .
In the coming days I should be able to publish some aerial map .
