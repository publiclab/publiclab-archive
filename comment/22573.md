If you were to bring your own IR source (most likely IR LED) under the water's surface and emit that, you [november 2017 Calendar](http://bit.ly/2euElBh) might find that different plant species reflect that light source differently, while plants within the same species have a similar reflectance. Studying in-group versus cross-group differences [October 2017 Calendar ](http://bit.ly/2vPJrL6)is precisely what ANOVA is for!

However, if you're just using one color to measure reflectance of a well known source (LED), you might be fine using some frequency of green rather than dealing with IR.
