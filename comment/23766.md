 Hi [@kkoerner](/profile/kkoerner), you wrote above that "Taking apart a PurpleAir and swapping out sensors is relatively easy, if there's a desire for a similar guide or some tips, leave a comment and we can do a similar tutorial."
  
I'd love to take you up on that offer! It would really help to:

* see a teardown of a Purple Air
* see how to swap out sensors
