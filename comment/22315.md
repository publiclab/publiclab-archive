I have a few other ideas for how replication could work:

* [@mathew](/profile/mathew) suggested: ways to encourage people to post "partway done" work, to ask for help and post their work so far
* how (in terms of interface) to mark something with success/failure: a prompt that creates a `replication:success` vs. `replication:unsuccessful` tag?
* echoing Gretchen, above -- who gets to mark it as such (author or replicator)
* how success condition is described/tested/debated -- and how the activity can be refined to have a narrower and more clearly articulated "success condition"
* perhaps a "mini-quiz" which replicators fill out, which helps establish and (through posting links to raw data) support a claimed "success"
* also via [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) -- a positive, discursive forum will be important to reach consensus on "success"

And one thought I had -- are people submitting replications incentivized to say that they've succeeded, or activity authors to agree? Or are activity authors incentivized to say that replications have failed? It probably depends a lot on the situation, but I could imagine these playing out this way...
