Just to chime in here on the REST vs. UI -- i think we'd like to see the online demo UI be refined a bit because I think that will help onboarding -- anything that'll help demonstrate IS in a very useful application will help there!

I also really like anything that'll make it easy to submit new modules. This'll help get new people in the door as it's easier than working on the core. A bigger team and more development will also drive interest in core refinements to accommodate real-world limitations we discover as we go!

So, i guess REST ends up lower on my list, even if I LOVE it as a concept. I think it'd be really useful for example to implement a completely separate service-based MapKnitter back-end, which could receive full-size images and distort them remotely for people. https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/ I'll leave this idea on your issue at https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues/198

Thanks to both of you for thinking this through so well! So in summary, i think summer priorities ought to be:

1. streamline module submission process for onboarding and growth - https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues/190
2. refine demo UI and provide more examples of usage for exciting applications, for outreach and demonstrations purposes: https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues/197

Thank you!!!!!!
