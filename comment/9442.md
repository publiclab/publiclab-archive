I am pretty sure that it could be done.  
My only concern would be converting the  microcontroller code from Energia code to Arduino.  The two are very similar but I dont believe that they would translate exactly.  I suspect that someone with a good knowledge of Arduino would be able to convert it with a little patience and work. 
I have no doubt that the GUI would work without any modification.  It just communicates through a serial port and there is no reason for it to care whether it is talking with a TI product or an Arduino. 
While the physical layout of the board would require adjusting, I have already drawn up an Eagle file for an Uno shield that I think should work.   Let me know if you want to give it a try.  I can easily post the Eagle file on GitHub (or send it directly to OSH Park if you want) and you could get a board made.
If you are interested in this, let me know how I can help.
