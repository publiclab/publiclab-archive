Nicely done, and nice temps for such a small pile too! I'm curious to see how long they can sustain that heat. 
I've done some work with compost in the past too: [Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Compost-Sensor/). I wonder if we could use Time Domain Reflectometry to get accurate moisture readings[....](http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/14/10/19639/pdf)

Regarding the failure to start without computer hookup....I haven't had that trouble at all with mine. It starts on its own without any problems.
