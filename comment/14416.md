[@Warren](/profile/Warren)'s thought about 'publishing assistance' is a good one and one which inherantly contains a filter mechanism. Orthogonal to a list of topic-based categories (spectrometer, mapping, water, etc.) is the 'type' (yes, a rather overloaded term) of work -- in this instance I'm referring to data analysis, vs engineering a design, vs construction technique, vs measurement accuracy, vs etc. Each will have a different degree of technical challenges but all have the need for solid documentation in common. So, in terms of "acceptance" criteria, all are subject to the requirements of including all the necessary document components, all must show a logical path through what is presented and all must show support for any conclusions drawn from what is presented and all of this is rooted in the principles of good science, good engineering and good communication. In addition, this general goal encourages feedback to the author.
