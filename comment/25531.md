Thank you for your response, [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) !
The SensorShip looks like a really interesting device and I will definitely consider using that in a part of the project. I have used a BME280 sensor for a weather station project before, but need to incorporate the soil and air quality sensing measurements. I am just not sure about the power requirements of the different sensors and whether the smaller microcontroller will be able to operate all my sensors.

The Mini Pearl Snap also looks like it could fulfill my requirements and part of the reason I posted here was so that I didn't try reinventing the wheel while designing this system. Thank you so so much for linking to similar projects!

I am still in the design stages, so this is extremely helpful.
