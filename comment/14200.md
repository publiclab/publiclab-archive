Ah, so you're not adding fluorescin AND baking soda to oil samples, but the baking soda may increase fluorescence of either fluorescin or oils? 

If so, I'd love to see a simple example of this. A test which shows a motor oil with different amounts of bakig soda, spectra overlaid. Would that be possible?

Thanks Dave!
