Good to know about CIE vs Hunter, I didn't even realize there were two different systems.

Since this case is simple enough and relies on the comparison across samples rather than the exact colorimeter values, as long as the app is using the same color scale across reads and as long as the lighting condition is fairly similar, the comparison will be valid. But, still good to recognize the variables and scales that impact the results.
