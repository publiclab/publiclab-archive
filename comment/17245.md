Hi [@ryzokuken](/profile/ryzokuken). This looks good now. I remember you published a npm package for the bot. Can you make a section named `Code links/ Work done`  and mention everything there?  Though the entire plotsbot project was started from scratch its good to have a section about the work done. Also please mention the open FTO issues. Put the link https://github.com/publiclab/plotsbot/labels/fto-candidate in the FTO section so anyone reading this can see those issues.
