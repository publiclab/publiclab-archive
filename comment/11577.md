One of my favorite moments was the week I spent at LUMCON in Cocodrie for last years Barnraising. It was the first time I got to see what Public Lab was in "real" life. I got to meet a host of wonderful people, organizers, and community members from all different walks of life. Everyone coming together from different backgrounds and with different needs to build a new community together. It was a wonderful experience to be a part of. I got to fly a kite and do low aerial mapping for the first time. I also got to host a session and introduce myself to this awesome world of Public Labbers and for the first time feel engaged and a part of something momentous. Cheers, and Happy Birthday Public Lab!
