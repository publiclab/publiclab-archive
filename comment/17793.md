Awesome, and also great formatting btw on your parts list here. I've been linking to "prerequisite" activities in some of my recent posts, which helps people know where to find things they should do before attempting an activity with a lot of implicit knowledge (perhaps kinda like you're saying here, regarding Nano Data Logger setup). Maybe we can have some kind of tagging grid, or power tag, which marks some 'do these first' activities. `first-do:###` or `prerequisite:#####` ...
