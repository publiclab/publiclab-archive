Dear Chris,
                 After some thoughts , i believe Rosco 19 is not accurate enough, i mean it collects only few spectrum of infrared. If the specification is accurate , then is there any practical advantage of this filter for NDVI? I think shifting to some other filters like Wratten 25 A  could be much convenient and its not that expensive ( ~ 8 USD ) 
I look forward to your answer.

Best Regards,
