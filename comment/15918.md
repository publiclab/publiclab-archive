one other tool you may want to consider is something like a haze cam, see http://hazecam.net/

These are typically used for wide open areas but I think it could be adapted for use in smaller areas.  The advantage of a fixed cam taking photos over time is you can compare when the source is on and off to get a better sense of impact.
