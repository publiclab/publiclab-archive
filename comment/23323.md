 The reason multimeters aren't used for measuring the resistance of a solution is polarization.  It's a fancy word, but by passing direct current through a solution, you generate gas (hydrogen or oxygen) that blocks the electrode makes the resistance value incorrect.  Look at it another way, your electrolyzing water and blocking part of the electrode.

Over a short term measurement, this might not be significant.  But that is why conductivity meters use AC.

Don't know about the coqui.  But in industry, one way to measure density is a modified tuning fork.  Sounds funny, but they have a glass tube ,shaped like a U, that they fill with the liquid and then measure the resonant frequency. From that, you can derive the density.
