Hi! Hope you're well -- we just announced this and I think it could be super awesome to pair up with your attachments! https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/12-13-2017/introducing-a-lego-spectrometer

There's also 3d files available at https://publiclab.org/lego which I hope can be used to make modules like yours connect to the Lego body. What do you think!?
