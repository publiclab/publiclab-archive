Kat,

Do you have a standard lycopene extraction? How do know what the spectrum of lycopene should look like?

Are you using a fluorescent lamp to make your extraction spectra with the Public Lab spectrometer? The lycopene peaks between 440 and 500 nm will only show up clearly if you use a continuous spectrum light source like a halogen lamp.

Have you compared these results to an extraction using just water or alcohol? These solvents will not extract all of the pigments, but might allow you to identify lycopene. Quantifying the amount of lycopene might require some other approach.
