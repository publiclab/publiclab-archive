Hello everyone, sorry for the late replies; I am posting the field study results from AQMD that I was referencing. Their tests indicate that the PM10 R^2 values in reference to the FEM BAM and FEM GRIMM are only about .6 - .75, being biased high on the low concentration end, and low on the high concentration end. I have done some more research and I believe that it is due to the application of the MIE scattering principle being used. 640nm (which is the wavelength of the lasers on the PurpleAir) is only about 6% of the size of a PM10 particle. That being said, with it so much smaller than PM10, MIE scattering isn't necessarily the best scatter method to use for accurate particle measurement.
