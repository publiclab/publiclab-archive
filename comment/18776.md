We found that for WiFi networks with no password, you can get it to log into any open network with:

```
network={
    key_mgmt=NONE
    priority=-999
    }
```

in `wpa_supplicant.conf`

And also, that once you've set the wifi network, you can re-set it by editing `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`
