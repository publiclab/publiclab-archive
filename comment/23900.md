 [@liz](/profile/liz) , [@warren](/profile/warren), this is great!  I just did my own first time issue and it was completely unplanned.  I've filed lots of issues on plots2 over the years, and I've definitely been a part of discussions about them.  As I've said previously, I'd love to help but I don't program in Ruby and so I honestly never expected to contribute to the project other than in discussion.  So, I'm trying to think deeply about what it was that made that possible.  Certainly beginning with some selfish motivations of needing something, but I definitely couldn't have capitalized on the opportunity certain aspects of an infrastructure for first timers been in place.  There is a lot here that resonates with me about my experience both in the dev and greater PL community.

As a person interested in data, networks, and community, at some point, I'd be game to run some sort of regression with other data (github, site Q&A, notes, etc.).  Additionally, if you can anonymize the respondents (shouldn't be too hard) it would be great to overlay colors derived from this data on top of an interaction network.

All and all, awesome!
