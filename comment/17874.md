Yes, clearly all but the last image shows compression in the Green (and Red though less). Because the process of spectral data from a webcam does not inherently contain a reference level, the best approach is simply visual. Watch the RGB curves as the light intensity is increased and look for early signs of compression in the highest peak. The early signs generally include a change in shape to the peak -- the shape should not change while the sensor is operating within its linear region. Since the resulting spectra is a combination of RGB, allowing any signal compression on any of the RGB channels only adds distortion (error) and so is useless / false information. It is much better to average out a little noise than to distort the spectrum because of compression.
