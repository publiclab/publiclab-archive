Wow, great post, [@mathew](/profile/mathew)! I was looking at the weather meter and it's around $500 used (dunno if there's a better place to buy it) -- https://www.amazon.com/Kestrel-Weather-Environmental-Meter-Compass/dp/B001JEPK1K/

But there are some cheaper and similar-looking devices (even sub-$100) in the "related products" section. Could any of those substitute when you're looking for windspeed?
