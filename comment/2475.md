Warren, that it an easy modification. I have access to an iPhone 3G, 3GS, 4, and a 4S so I should be able to whip up mounting plates for those pretty easily.

I have taken a couple spectra with it but unfortunately my Android tablet is not playing very well with Spectral Workbench. Here is one I took of the CFL bulb in my desk lamp with my iPhone 4 and processed with the scitioys.com engine. It is very overexposed so the peaks are muddy but a little fiddling with the camera settings or using my DSLR would give much better results. In fact, that gives me an idea. I have already made a microscope adapter for my DSLR so it should be really easy to make a spectrometer adapter. Now I know what I'm doing this weekend.
