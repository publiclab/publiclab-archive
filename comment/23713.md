 Oh, I am so sorry I don't know how I missed out on your comment [@warren](/profile/warren), I was not doing so well for the past couple of days.
Yes, I think we could make some sorts of profile tags to implement that.
I think "Recommended Questions" can once again be tag-based, according to what the user is following and check for distinct questions.
I think we can stretch the map, no problem.
Thanks a lot for your feedback and for spending so much time on my proposal, I will implement these changes soon and get back to you!
