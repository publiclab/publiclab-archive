I love the idea of language neutral plugins and process invocation that plays off the convenience and power of a Linux command line environment.  As we chatted about, it is important to sandbox potentially buggy code that interacts with unpredictable hardware.  One issue for example is a hung process that does not reply - a "clogged pipe" - there needs to be some [optional]? timeout mechanism - an automated plumber to fix the leak (invoke a reset process) or seal it off (issue an exception).  Maybe the exceptions need be sent through the associated pipe or a special garbage chute (logging channel/email or text notification)? 

Could we use the term "period" instead of "frequency" which has an inverse time association?  Also why not provide human friendly types and units of times like floating point seconds, minutes, hours, days? What about annotating periods as in "1.0s", "1.0m", "1.0h", "1.0d"?  Check variable names with "miniumum [sic]".

Where do those nice long hashy pipeIDs come from?
