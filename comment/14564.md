Hi [@warren](/profile/warren), thanks for all the hints and links. 

I did some testing as well. Here is a capture from the output signal of softmodem. 

[softmodem_test.ino](https://gist.github.com/rmeister/9eadfbc95e1bfec55f2922dbd7d33a0a)

This explains the wide spectrum you observed with fl-digi. For simplicity, softmodem does not use sine waves. To some extend, I think it is possible to produce more sine-like signals, but this will also eat up a lot of CPU time. So applying filters at receiver side is what I would like to try first. 

For windowing in the frequency domain I will try to use [dsp.js](https://github.com/corbanbrook/dsp.js). If this is not going to work well, I would start writing my own filter functions.
