 Yes! Love this `Newcomer --> Contributor --> Reviewer --> Maintainer --> Maintainer + Time to explore new repo and specialize in that  😃 `

This connects with and builds on what [@sashadev-sky](/profile/sashadev-sky) wrote in https://publiclab.org/notes/sashadev-sky/05-16-2019/public-lab-s-contribution-framework-deep-dive-2019

Perhaps we could link from the first 3 steps to a longer "journey" we encourage people to take, that has these extra steps!

Re: diagram, yeah!!!! I was thinking of that when i made it, will add a link. It was a tough diagram to make, actually - and bigger and more complex than I'd expected!
