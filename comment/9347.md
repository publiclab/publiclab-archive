Hi there,
Very interesting project.
Does this software offer multi-potential steps mode for the GUI?
I'm interested in making some lead dioxide on graphite electrodes using a potentiostat.
THe "CheapSTAT" software does this, but the board is considerably more complex than yours.

Thanks
Doug
