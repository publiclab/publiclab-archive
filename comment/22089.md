 I had mostly meant that we ought to focus primarily on the Gitter-type JS Notification API, and if time remains in the summer, to follow-up with the more expanded version. Both is fine! I'm just very focused on achieving our main interest first, and not trying to tackle both at once, if that makes sense ðŸ™Œ
