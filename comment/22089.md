 I had mostly meant that we ought to focus primarily on the Gitter-type JS Notification API, and if time remains in the summer, to follow-up with the more expanded version. Both is fine! I'm just very focused on achieving our main interest first, and not trying to tackle both at once, if that makes sense 🙌
