Hi Chris, thanks for the reply. The kit "DIY Plant Analysis Filter Kit" consists of a red and a blue gelatin. Yes, I want to change the Phantom camera 3, in fact I have already done, the first question that I was born (I'll put the blue one or the red one?) I put the red. But to have the possibility of a variety of use, I would remove it and insert it into the filter that is in front of 'goal, but I do not know if this can be done. In short, to do some 'of experiments with different types of filter. I send you a picture made at a height of about 60 meters with the change I made. Then tell me if it is of acceptable quality? I build drones and I have a lot of experience on this field of optical change.
Kind Regards
