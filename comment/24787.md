 Ah yes! For a moment there I was confused between what the paper was saying about non linearness applied to pixels prior to data export and AGC. I see they are two very different things. Yes the photos in this post would have been impossible to take if AGC was on. Using the cam software that comes with pi builder, you can turn off the exposure mode which turns off the AGC, so you can set exposure time, resolution, and iso manually. I should post a screenshot of my settings at the bottom there in case anyone wants to see or copy. I had everything controlled except for shutter speed, just like a regular manual camera. But I agree about having a dedicated software that is even more raw because the ip control face does not allow for long exposures for some odd reason, nor raw data export, and its a bit unclear about which settings override other settings (though you can read it in the docs) so that's why I am leaning towards a different/custom data extraction program too.
