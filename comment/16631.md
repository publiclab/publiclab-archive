Hi Stevie,

I'll attach some recent sedimentation examples.  We've experienced heavy rain fall and flooding this month which caused moisture damage to the trail cam (last week).  I've pulled the unit, and ordered a new camera to replace the water damaged unit.  I intend to donate the new camera, and will ship the damaged one back to you for insurance claim purposes.

Best regards,

Dwight
