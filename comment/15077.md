The print looks great! For opening the .f3d file, there is a certain way you have to open it which I forgot to mention.

Once you have made a project you'd like to save the file in, click on the "upload" cloud with the arrow on it. You can then select the .f3d file from its save location and open it in Fusion.

To change the angle of those holes, it may be easiest to make new ones, or another option would be to look through the sketches in the .f3d file and select the one that was used to make the hole, then move it and change its angle. (There are a lot of sketches in the .f3d file and I'm not sure if that one is named, I apologize in advance for my organizational skills).
