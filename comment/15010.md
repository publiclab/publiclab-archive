Another question... I see that voltage on a 'nanite' arduino clone is ~3v, and I'm wondering; peak to peak line load seems to be around -1.5-1.5v for some cases ("pro" standard...?). based on this doc, if I'm reading it right: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_level 

Also looking at http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/28404/what-is-the-voltage-range-of-a-standard-headphone-jack-from-a-phone

Reason I ask is that in the past, I've plugged this nanite with no voltage control into the headphone port of an old iMac, and just recorded audio directly into GarageBand. I know this is a risk, but I'm not sure if the peak/trough max range accounts for being DC (which'd be a 3v swing in positive) or something... or if the ADC in the iMac is just pretty robust. This was with SoftSerial, not SoftModem (which as mentioned I haven't gotten working on an ATTiny yet). 

And I'm not much of an electronics person, so I may just be totally off here, but from the line level wiki page, is amplitude based on change in voltage? It sounds a bit more complex. Trying to learn a bit about this here: http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/86703/in-a-line-level-audio-signal-what-function-of-voltage-produces-amplitude 

Long story short, I'm interested to try just plugging this directly into an old Android phone, and seeing if I can receive SoftModem messages directly off the Tx/Rx pins.
