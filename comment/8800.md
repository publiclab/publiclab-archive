That display is impressive.  

I'll be quite crass and ask: would you like to donate any of these to some folks down in Reserve and Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana?  It could mean a lot for folks who live in the shadow of Grain and Petroleum coke Export facilities.  I'm currently making a DustDuino or two, in my spare time (which is mythical) but I can think of 7 communities in Louisiana who would want to deploy these to gather evidence that these facilities are making it hard to breathe around here.

I'll forward this to my roomate, a CMU alum in New Orleans.

cheers!
