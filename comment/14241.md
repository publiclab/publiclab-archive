[@viechdokter](/profile/viechdokter):, thanks; just a lot of years of practice. Not to worry, your's are logical and thoughtfully organized.

Jeff, thanks. Yes, new observations do tend to provoke new questions ;-)

1) Yes, because the "drift" / low-frequency noise is more predominant, some form of 'AGC loop noise' (might be digitally controlled) seems more likely to me. Other contributors, like shot noise / dark current noise, are more likely to be Gaussian and so, with a spectrum, appears as the smaller nm-scale 'hash' that commonly appears on the signal. Remember, the camera is expecting to be illuminated over its whole area so the camera's 'algorithm' (analog or digital) is working to that. Whereas the spectral band is just a narrow patch in an otherwise dark field; so the camera's response is likely 'full gain'. If the 'gain' were per-pixel, then the near-full-scale R/G/B of the spectrum should be quite stable -- but it doesn't appear to be.

2) The 12V source is regulated I believe (though not regulated like a DC supply. While there may be some high-frequency hash on the supply, the lamp acts like a low-pass filter (it's a thermal device so reacts slow) which is why I believed monitoring the current would be usable. The digital voltmeter can easily respond to at least 1 Hz and while I plotted only at 1 sample per minute, the meter readings remained solid; no flicker. So, I have no evidence the lamp or the supply is less stable than the 0.36 % I measured. A 120VAC lamp would be subject to line-voltage variations; which are generally small and generally slow. If your lights are not flickering, you might see 1-2 VAC shift over a minute (if line voltage is drifting at all) which would only be 1-2 % worst case. The larger difference for 120VAC might be the intensity difference from one day or week to the next.

3) Yes, I noted the macro for SWB. Unfortunately, the issues are more basic than that. Often, the latency gets excessive which hangs scripts which affect not only extracting data and plotting but recovery of data -- which then must be re-extracted for analysis. It's much easier, and much more reliable, for me to extract, store, process and plot all with Matlab and all locally without the web and scripts overhead.

4) Quantifying stability, relative to construction, would be difficult (shaker table?) and impossible relative to potential user effects on a paper and Velcro assembly. I still have the paper version (though it did start to fall apart rather quickly) just do not know how to measure and quantify those effects on measurement stability. With the V3 kit, when I touched the cable or the paper box, tried to hold it still with both hands or even just let it sit on the desk, the recovered intensity profile would visibly shift, jump or drift. This is NOT the characteristics of a stable measurement device and I don't need to figure out how to quantify that drift vs type of handling.

The big clue is that optical benches are made of granite slabs not paper and Velcro. I simplified and used maple and glue. This is a typical failure of the minimal-cost strategy of product development where allowing performance to be just "pretty good" in order to save 5-10% of the product cost is, like the parallel in science, just bad engineering which will come back to bite you in the end. A scientific device, of any grade, absolutely must be constructed to meet viable specs. A paper and Velcro design for a stable optical device with better than 5% stability and <=2nm resolution is simply not going to be possible.

So, yes it is good to have others looking at the reproducibility of their results -- even doing so on a routine basis as part of the scientific process. Always be your own skeptic. However, if PLab's goal is to provide a stable and well specified spectrometer for many users to make their own reliable observations, the design must be substantially improved over the existing product. This research note simply shows the present limits to intensity measurement stability.
