Hi [@amirberAgain](/profile/amirberAgain), thank you so much for sharing this. I've been searching on the web how I can make my own hyperspectral imaging camera and I'm so excited to find your post. I'm making orders for the parts following your instruction in the DIY HSI.pptx file (page 8) and wanted get your confirmation that I'm ordering the right stuff. I'm planning to order these:
- Desktop Spectrometry Kit 3.0 https://publiclab.myshopify.com/collections/spectrometry/products/acetate-slit-bundle?variant=984554492
- Spectrometry Slit Upgrade Pack https://publiclab.myshopify.com/collections/spectrometry/products/acetate-slit-bundle?variant=984554492
- I already have a webcam so I don't need to order a new one
- I'm not sure which grating I should order. You mentioned that you ordered one from rainbow symphony. I went to the online store and there are many types of gratings. Do you have any recommendations which one I should get?
- If there are anything that I'm missing from my cart  or if you have any advice in terms of building, please let me know.

Thank you so much!
