Hey Don, quick question, I was trying to compile the riffle code on a naked Arduino Uno (nothing attached), and downloaded the libraries and such, however I can't see that the RTC_DS3231 class has the function 'begin' in it (line 100).  Am I missing a library or messing something else up?

RTC.begin();

Once I get it to compile, I think as you said it should be fairly straightforward to adjust the output.
