Yes that's the idea! In DIY Satellite Ground Station workshops we often found it difficult to navigate different operating systems on the fly. APT 3000, the only other browser based decoder to our knowledge, proved glitchy and returns low resolution raw images. open-weather apt will be accessible to all running a browser and will output full resolution images created using different demodulation methods. It will also be possible to adjust when the decoder looks for the first sync in order to work with WAV files whose beginnings are quite noisy (which is frequently the case for beginners).
