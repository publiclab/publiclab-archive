Microplastic Pollution is found in our water. In its micro state it has infiltrated our oceans, water supplies, and even our bodies. The water cycle makes sure that our water is reused. The water we drink has always been on Earth and will always remain on Earth and it has been reused in a multitude of ways. Scientist have discovered that as a result of our ever growing plastics industry, micro sized pieces of plastic have infiltrated our water. Water is reused and recycled naturally, but without proper disposal they will not be recycled or naturally dispose because plastics are non-biodegradable. Since our water has become polluted with microplastics, both freshwater and saltwater, it is obvious that the plastics have and will remain in our water cycle so long as we don't interfere. The water cycle also provides an explanation as to how widespread microplastic pollution has become. It demonstrates a cycle in which microplastic polluted water is transformed and transported around the world continually to be reused for different purposes.
