Hi,
Update (13/02/2014). In the new version of this camera released by Logitech the IR filter is integrated in the sensor itself. It is impossible to remove without removing the entire sensor as well.  That means that cameras with the serial number: 1345LZ0DXXXX they are no longer useful for IR conversions. The cameras that seem to work as described in this article are the ones that have the serial number: 1248LZ0BXXXX
I hope this will be useful for somebody.

Best regards,
Luis.
