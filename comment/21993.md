 I had seen a post on Instagram a while back of people measuring the pulses from a Coqui using an Arduino... but i was thinking more about this and have been trying to use a guitar tuning app... only semi-successfully! 

http://guitar-tuner.appspot.com doesn't seem to work... i tried some apps too. The ideal would be to get a concrete measurement of frequency, but i wonder if the Coqui is often outside the range many apps would listen...? Or it's pretty quiet... I'd love it folks tried this out and reported back in!

I'll post a question!
