For shoes, there I found no miracles with EM. I wear minimal shoes with no socks for running, and they get REALLY stinky fast. A dusting of plain old baking soda once a week if i am wearing them every day works wonders on those shoes. The spray does work great on perma-BO of shirts and sweaters as a pre-wash treatment, and has de-smelled my boyfriends car successfully. 

EM is a proprietary blend of bacteria and yeasts that have been marketed for organic farming and its harder to find. You could also try diluted unpasteurized pickle or kraut juice maybe if you were feeling like experimenting and your shoes couldnt smell any worse.  You could also try fermenting a probiotic pill in sugar water (I have done this successfully, but threw it away because, warning, fermenting in a spray device is not smart and messy because the pressure causes liquid to leak out of the nozzle). Make sure whatever you are spraying is very dilute or things will become sticky. 

If you remind me I will bring some EM mother culture to the barnraising if you still want it. 

An honest warning though: EM culture smells like delicious molasses to me, however other people ensure me that when undiluted and freshly fermented it smells like flammable baby barf.   If you dilute it it wont smell strongly, an once dry, there is no smell...
