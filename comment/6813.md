I love the theory that the blue card is flooding the blue channel to minimize or outweigh or "wash out" the infrared from that channel. I think that makes some sense -- the sensor *should* be much more sensitive to visible light, and if we have a high-reflective blue card, it should allow us to balance the relative amounts of blue and IR. 

A test to try -- see if the blue cards we use are bright or dark in the infrared range!
