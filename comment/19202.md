[@warren](/profile/warren) Thanks. Perhaps, but if the info in the link is true, the solution is just finding a new RTC module that runs at 5V. I misread the power requirements for the sensor and thought it was 3.3v and built a standard 3.3v mini-pearl. So I've got to start over. The good karma is that an eBay supplier mistakenly sent me 10 5V pro-mini boards that must be 100 years old. The negative karma is that, while the mini-pearl RTC modules are rated at 5V, ugly things appear to happen when they are overpowered.  I haven't even started to look at alternative RTC modules; maybe tomorrow.
