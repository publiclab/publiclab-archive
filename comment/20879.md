I did a few things differently:

1. I opened up the webcam + stripped it of its black plastic housing

2. I left the DVD in the freezer overnight -- this lessened the cracking on cutting, but might have made peeling the Aluminum harder.

3. Definitely don't use acetone ... it demolished the grating 

4. The assembly directions might be out of order with the narrow-slit being installed prior to ensuring that the webcam is aligned + able to pickup a spectrum at all.  I had to go back + remove the silt-filter and reposition the webcam to catch the correct light path.  This might be solved by drilling + tapping a lego and including a screw to adjust the tilt of the webcam.

5. Ive got a protocol for removing the aluminum foil which might be reproducible Im picking up more DVDs today to give it a try

6. Alignment from the slit-filter to the webcam seems to be the biggest problem currently.  

7. Purchasing a CFL bulb has been a challenge as well.

8. Final alignment ( light source >> slit-filter >> webcam ) is still up in the air.  Not sure how complex its going to be
