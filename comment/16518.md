Hi, all -- [@ccpandhare](/profile/ccpandhare), [@siaw23](/profile/siaw23), [@mkashyap354](/profile/mkashyap354), [@Ashan](/profile/Ashan), [@Khamba](/profile/Khamba), [@mridulnagpal](/profile/mridulnagpal), [@ryzokuken](/profile/ryzokuken), [@inzamam](/profile/inzamam), [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996), [@ashwinvasudevan](/profile/ashwinvasudevan) please be aware that you'll have to submit a final proposal also on the GSoC website -- it can be a copy-paste of the final version of your proposal from this page. I see some of you have done so, but not all -- thanks, and I appreciate your willingness to work on this site where we can discuss things, and do a second copy in the GSoC website for the formal application.
