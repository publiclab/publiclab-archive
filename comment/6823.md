Thanks [@warren](/profile/warren)! Fixed my store link — you might want to update the one at http://publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping-kit then, too?

The camera seems to last around 3h. Hoping to keep the system rolling throughout the install, which will take a couple of days at least. Today's probably the most boring, just inventory and chalking lines and whatnot.
