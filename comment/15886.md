Hi Patrick, I am also curious about when the fee is waived and when it's not. I know that in some counties (though I'm not sure if the county is always the granting authority), community certification costs are provided through permit fees for the industry. However, I'm not sure what factors into this. I've heard that in other places, the state environmental agency waives the fee (though I'm not sure if that is state-provided training, or third-party training like Aeromet), but I'm not sure the rhyme or reason to when the fees are waived and when they're not. [@ccampos](/profile/ccampos) and [@MD2020](/profile/MD2020) -- do you know when, where, or why sometimes permit fees are used to pay for community observer certification?
