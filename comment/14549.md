Really, **almost** there, I guess I must not have accounted for the loss of material by the laser, but it needs to be 1/16 inch taller and wider. Maybe 1/8 inch taller since that'd be fine to have a small amount of extra room on. 

I'd also like to add another bolt halfway across the span, as I think it's sagging a little. Shouldn't affect the compactness of the cutting area.
