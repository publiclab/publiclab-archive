This is truly awesome.  I have spent much of my life in libraries and archives, and am super excited to see someone bringing these prodigious resources into the digital realm. 

Your steps to georeference and provide narrative context sound really great too.  This such an excellent way to engage students in history and service to their region.  I can't wait for the videos, and thanks for documenting your work here!
