Councilwoman Palmer's office is very concerned about the impacts of theFormosa Plastics plants; impacts to Drinking Water in Algiers and Eastbank Orleans, URGENT!

kristin.palmer@nola.gov 504 658 1030

to do: review NPDES permits for Dow facility in Taft, LA, and Formosa Plastics in Port Lavaca, TX, to get a list of chemicals

to do: review Environmental Working Groups' data on existing Drinking water issues in St Charles, Jefferson, and Orleans Parish

Find SWB staff who test NOLA drinking water (especially Westbank) 

Formosa Plastics FG LA proposal in St James will hide this information until the plant is built, and Louisiana will let them.

So 1) we need to stop the plant, because that is terrible
2) we should review the existing pollution, and project the impacts that Formosa is hiding from us
