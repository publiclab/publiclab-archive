Things I want to know about your table:

- What is a "vis-red block above lens?"
- Why is the above different for the A495 and Mobius?
- Does the "lens" row apply to either of the two sensors?
- Does the "per-pixel color filter array" apply to the NIR related columns for the two sensors?

I think that using the sensors to calibrate NDVI images from a camera requires sensor readings of just the light being reflected from a homogeneous area of plants. That area must be noted and later identified in the single-camera NIR/VIS photo. The NIR/VIS relationship from the sensors can then be used to adjust that area to get a similar NIR/VIS relationship. The same adjustment can be made to the rest of the image (unless you take sensor readings from multiple areas in the scene, but then why bother with the camera?).

Hooking up the sensors to the camera for synchronous collection is a long shot. It will be hard enough to make a device with the sensors that allows you to aim both sensors (probably through a felt-lined tube) at a homogeneous area of vegetation and record data with a timestamp or index number. Custom software will be needed to match up the photos with the sensor readings (unless there are just a few of each). Additional software will be needed to apply the correction to each photo (maybe a Fiji plugin). This will require manual intervention to identify the particular area of vegetation sensed by the sensor.

Using the sensors to calibrate Infragram photos is strangely similar to PeeBee's ideas in the comments to this note: http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/09-06-2013/mobius-stripped.  I think PeeBee might be on to something, but my brain hurt trying to figure it out.

The Mobius Action Cam does not have a mode for triggering electronically. So triggering a Mobius and the sensor synchronously might not be possible. The Mobius does have a time-lapse mode, so it will shoot every 10 seconds and record a timestamp. That could be synced to the sensors doing the same thing. But that's awkward if the sensors have to be held close to the vegetation and the camera is farther away. The Mobius could always be triggered mechanically with an electronically controlled contraption.
