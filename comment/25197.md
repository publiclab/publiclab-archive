Barriers: my own self! It was hard to not take ownership of some of the students' projects. Also, being ok with chaos as a process and that learning can and will lead to a messy & loud classroom was a big stepping stone for me to really get PBL off the ground and running.

Lessons learned: being specific on expectations. Having students genuine reflect/self evaluate along the way is extremely important part of the process. Having community connections willing to join in the learning process helped make it unique. I really grew in my 1 on 1 conferencing skills. 

I cannot teach a non PBL based style anymore. Students excitement and engagement is beyond anything I have ever achieved via textbook or close reading in my classroom. Parents and school staff all appreciated this Genius Hour project. 

Tips: Just do it! As a classroom teacher this will be such a great experience for you, your students, parents, and admins.
