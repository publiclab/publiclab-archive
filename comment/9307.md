RE: Kite Reels and Line-
  It was definitely 50 Ibs line but now that I know better I made sure to order a Yo Yo Reel with 150 Ibs Dacron this time. In hindsight it validates my decision to use the lighter cheaper camera all that more!  As I mentioned earlier, I ordered a Mobius Action Cam that should be arriving tomorrow so I'll have the weekend to go over various options for the Picavet/Rig before the new line arrives. It certainly helps to have a 3D Printer, but with only 4x4x4 to work with I'll have to get creative.
