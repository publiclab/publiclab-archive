I've been using that reel for about 3 years now and I love it.  Mathew is right - don't bring the line in under tension.  I have had a reel collapse as well.  The reel that collapsed was made from two plastic halves fused together and they separated.

I have been very pleased with the reel pictured.  It has plastic guts though, so I try to apply some braking to the line when releasing a balloon or else I end up with plastic shavings from the plastic axle.  One nice additional modification is adding some dense foam or other lightweight material to the core to increase the radius and decrease the number of rotations required to reed it in the entire way.  I've actually been kiting more than ballooning lately and have been using Charlie's winder for over two years and love it.  Each movement around it reels in 2 feet of line AND I can bring it in under tension with no fear of collapse.  They are oak.
