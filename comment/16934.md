This is great! I'm starting an effort that will involve the parallel build of a simple in situ data logger (e.g. Riffle or maybe Cave Pearl) and a slightly simpler version of the KnowFlow (only PH, ORP, and EC). The hope is that these can be finished in time to sample at the same time/locations as some EPA supported sampling this fall. The parts for the KnowFlow-esque are going to be ordered from DFRobot and was wondering if you could point me toward the appropriate 'isolation module'? Thanks! Dave
