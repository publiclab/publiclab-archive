Not sure if you've seen some resources that were posted here: https://publiclab.org/n/18505

From that page: _If you are you trying to get baseline data about the soil contaminant levels, a good strategy would be to take individual samples from various locations on site, taken from various depths. If you are wanting to grow food in the soil and want to check for lead and other contaminant levels, you'd want to take samples from 2-14 inches deep, because that is the depth of the roots of most vegetables you would grow._

There are some more tidbits that may be useful, further down under **What is your sampling strategy?**
