Jeff, I have doubts about "current bleeding" between the quantum wells as they are isolated from each other with silicon and the conversion to data is generally per-row and on-chip so clipped but not blended. I'd be more inclined to accept an optical effect involving refraction between the filter layers at the sensor's front surface creating a 'blooming' effect or even refraction effects of the cheap poly-carbonate lens. But yes, all just additional reasons to prevent channel clipping.
