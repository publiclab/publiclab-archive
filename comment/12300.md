Awesome. This went well, although unlike the laser cutter, my Silhouette cutter doesn't remove material, so the V-shaped piece didn't quite fit. If we did this as a production run we'd want to make it a tiny bit narrower for a smooth fit. 

I did mine in green because I am out of black paper (some is shipping to me) but it was easier to photograph, and a few steps where I wasn't sure, I took an extra photo once I figured it out. For example, I put in the V-shaped piece (we should number the pieces!) backwards despite the warning, because i misunderstood which direction the photo was from.

Also, I think once we move to larger batches, some printed-on guides like "fold so spot A touches spot B" could be helpful (as above), and "ensure that the "B" end of all three pieces are on the same side" or something. 

Very very clever design, Mathew - especially seeing it all come together in sequence. Love it -- i actually had a pre-assembled one so this was my first time all the way through.
