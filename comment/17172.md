Yes, the newer Rev. P sensor works better in high wind because it has a strong heater so the wind can't cool it off too fast. But the older Rev C sensor should have worked okay in 8 mph wind. I don't have any good ideas about why the Rev. C sensor gave erroneous results.

I have a test prepared to address the question of clean power for the Rev P sensor which was competing with the GPS receiver and antenna for current during the first test. I made a new SkyPod with a real time clock instead of a GPS. I will mount it on the Picavet cross instead of the rig frame so it won't rotate with the rig and will maintain its orientation to the wind. If those two changes don't produce less noisy results, we will have learned something. I should also deploy the Rev P sensor on a tripod at a windy place to see if it produces less noisy data.

Does the Kestrel you have log data? Some of the $200 to $400 anemometers do, but most cheaper ones don't. It would be really good to have a logging anemometer. Or someone who could hack a cheap one and log its output. Getting an instantaneous reading of wind speed would be good for general calibration, but if it doesn't produce a data file, is it science?
