Hi, this is super. Sorry for responding slowly but your timeline is really great. One suggestion:

> Start writing integration tests for the new features

You could also potentially write unit tests for the back-end to various APIs by writing Services, like these: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/master/app/services/typeahead_service.rb

Unit testing is less computationally "expensive" and more targeted, but with, not /instead/ of, fuller testing like integration or functional. And these services can be used throughout the application. 

I've made a new tag for API-related proposals: [#soc-2018-api](/tag/soc-2018-api) as [@Raounak](/profile/Raounak) [@rishabh07](/profile/rishabh07) [@sukhbir](/profile/sukhbir) have all submitted API-related proposals as well. Awesome, thanks all!

If you're interested you can try coordinating with the other proposers; it's possible we'd do multiple API projects, so let's think collaboratively! If projects are broken up in to self-contained parts well enough, two or more people could in theory tackle this together, although there is also an option to reorganize proposals after they're accepted to reduce redundancy. 

Thanks a lot!
