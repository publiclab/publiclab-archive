Hi [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1), [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) and [@sasha](/profile/sasha), just jumping on this thread to add my enthusiasm! 

After [@sashae](/profile/sashae) and I got our Foundation Licences from RSGB it took months of poking around on the web to realise that it was possible to receive weather satellite images, then, even more time, searching and hanging out in Ham forums ([@sashae](/profile/sashae) is great at this) before we got the right hardware and software setups. Now we've done the research and seen what's possible with such cheap kit we're keen to share our experience by creating an accessible How-to guide with everything you need to know to get started, all in one place â€“ something that we were convinced must exist but haven't found yet. 

Once we get something online we'd love to have your feedback. All ideas welcome! As [@sashae](/profile/sashae) mentioned, the How-to guide will be part of a bigger project about feminist histories of remote sensing!
