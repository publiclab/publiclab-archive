Microplastic is an increasing problem in the environment. Microplastic particles are smaller the 5 mm in size. Plastic accumulates in soil, land, rivers, lakes, and in the ocean. Microplastics can cause damage to human cells which is concerning because once the plastic is in the environment there really isn't a way of getting it out. We are exposed to them everyday when eating or even inhaling. You never know when you are surrounded by them. The microplastics can also travel through waterways which end up in the ecosystems and have an effect by harming the marine life, fish, algae, crabs, turtles, and even birds.
