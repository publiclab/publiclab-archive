My final contribution for the day: I'm happy with how strong you can get a zip tie to lock onto the end of a dowel, and came up with the following, super-easy-to-teach method of getting the camera to lock onto the rig. The method is to cinch the zip tie down on the dowel as tight as you can, then slide it off, go one more click, and then jam the result back onto the dowel. It is **on there**

I then used the tail to wrap up, and tuck under the loops of the other two ties. The two ties are necessary to keep the camera in alignment, but you can easily slide them off to fuss with the camera. The friction of the ties on one another is just the right amount to let you remove them, but also trust them to stay in place in flight. 

Protection for the camera could be added by tucking a couple strips of bottle plastic into the rig, having them protrude forward and away from the lens. Not going to fuss this part today, but consider this the devil-may-care model shown:
