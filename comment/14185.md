This is great. I have been hoping someone would do a study of stability -- I'm curious, is there a discernable trend over time, as I've seen changes especially in the near infrared spectrum of a warm fluorescent lamp (with a filter-stripped webcam). I'm also curious about the stability over time of a halogen lamp and/or a Solux lamp as [@stoft](/profile/stoft) has used in his work. I'm thinking a timeframe of 2 hours in 5min intervals would be a really interesting dataset to see, and very important regarding our assumptions in gain correction.
