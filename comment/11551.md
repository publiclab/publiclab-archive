How does the file look?  You should be able to open it with excel or notepad.  It looks to me like it should have one row of headings followed by hundreds of rows with values in two columns.  It should start  something like:
    element # ,waveln. At elem cent.
    1,	400.3869669
    2, 401.1610482
Are you able to get the GUI to launch when you click on the play button or does the error come before that?
