In this area, lichens aren't common.  Attached is a rough draft using lawn clippings to set up and test using various instruments.  Don't know how well it will work-haven't tried it, yet.  Getting ahold of things like centrifuge tubes can be hard.  If anyone tries it, please let us know the results!
