 Hi [@kahlilkochiyama](/profile/kahlilkochiyama) and [@shannonkmcalpine](/profile/shannonkmcalpine), I just searched for air quality in Gardena, Ca, and found an article in the Daily Breeze, 
https://www.dailybreeze.com/2017/03/01/air-quality-data-shows-pollution-from-torrance-refinery-far-higher-than-others-in-southern-california/
in 2017.  There is a group mentioned and the name of a Torrance resident.  You might try and look her up and find out what, if anything, their group has done or is doing. Also found an LA Times article that states Torrance refinery is required to set up a system for air quality monitoring at its fenceline by 2020:

Getting in touch with the South Coast Air Quality Management District  might enable you to find out about this and have input on where monitors should be placed and how the community should be able to access the data. Please excuse me if you are familiar with this information already and have reasons for wanting to monitor on your own.
