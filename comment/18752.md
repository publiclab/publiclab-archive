Just built it - So awesome! This kit is really fun. Love it. 

I might suggest a piece of double sided sticky tape to stick the Rasberry Pi to the base of the microscope stand. Also, we didn't have feet for it, though somehow we managed to find some around the house to use, and they seemed really important for leveling the bottom.
