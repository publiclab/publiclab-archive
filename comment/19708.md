We've placed a PM monitor there, but the PM lasers don't catch the larger dust particles. We want to be able to demonstrate that ambient air quality in some backyards along the fenceline of this industrial aggregate distribution center and adjacent asphalt facility is dangerous. I was back there for an hour and had to evacuate twice due to the dust. We want to make a solid case for the municipal government to step in a mediate between the companies and the residents. The companies have met a few times with residents, but the problem has never been resolved. The dust is absolutely overwhelming, but the monitor we placed doesn't "see" it as well as it should.

Visually, I would hope to demonstrate that yards as close as across the street have dramatically better air quality than the yards in question.

I am thinking something along the lines of clear packing tape but am wanting to hear from folks with experience visually capturing dusty air.

Thanks!
