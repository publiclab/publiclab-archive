Another good diagnostic tool for the Infrapix app could be display of a grayscale image of the blue channel of the infrablue photo. For example, the NIR image (the red channel) that is displayed for Jeff's photo above has very white tree foliage which suggests lots of NIR. If the blue channel also has white foliage, it is obvious that NIR is getting in there. That's all you need to know to start looking for another camera.
