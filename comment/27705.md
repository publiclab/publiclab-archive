Hello again&nbsp;

  

I’m currently investigating the possibility of flying a very lightweight IR camera onboard a pico balloon. These party size foil balloons&nbsp;are now routinely used by radio amateurs for circumnavigating the globe at a near constant float attitude,&nbsp;but can also be ‘over-filled’ for short up-burst-down local flights.&nbsp;The ESP32-CAM board seems ideal for this type of application. It is only a few square cm in size and weighs about 7 grams, including the colour camera and uSD card socket. It isreasonably&nbsp;easy to unscrew the camera lens barrel and remove the IR-blocking filter and then add the red-pass filter (externally over the reassembled lens) for taking raw NIR images in order to attempt NDVI post-processing.&nbsp;

  

To operate this board it definitely helps to be familiar with the Arduino &nbsp;development environment.&nbsp; Because,&nbsp; in addition to supporting a wide range of ready to use libraries, it also provides example programmes for setting up the camera parameters (white balance ext) and storing images to the removable uSD card in a PC compatible format. Although basic camera operation is therefore possible without undertaking &nbsp;software development, &nbsp;Arduino programmers will find that the board’s ESP32 microcontroller is quite capable of performing other processing tasks when not actually engaged in driving the camera and storing images.

Even though the camera is specified at only 2 Mp, initial ground tests of the modified ESP32-CAM board provided quite acceptable NIR images of vegetation in SVGA resolution.&nbsp; I now have the challenge of optimising the post-processing parameters and interpreting&nbsp; the resultant colorized NDVI images, but that would be the case for any camera.&nbsp;

Please let me know if you&nbsp;need further details.&nbsp;

Mike.
