Will, the intertidal zone is a great subject for infrablue. Aerial shots at low tide are going to make striking maps of Fucus distribution.  

Is this the same camera that Liz used to take her Brooklyn shot: http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/05-31-2013/ir-treekit ?
Your infrablues look a little dull in comparison. Any idea what the difference is? I tried making NDVI and NBG from them and they came out dull too. Could you list the camera specs and settings?
