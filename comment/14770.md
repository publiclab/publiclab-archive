This is probably not the best data set to do calculus on. The air temperature data is from a sensor in a jug suspended above the pile, and the battery data is from inside the Nalgene bottle. The jug and the bottle were close, but got heated by the sun differently. 

What we need is temperature data from the RTC on the Riffle which I was not logging here.That can be added to Kina's new sketch. Then if the battery is close to the Riffle you  can have a good record of the temperature and any related changes in voltage. 

With a few more MCP9808s we can definitely instrument a beehive for 3D temperature modelling.
