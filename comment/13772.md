[@bortek](/profile/bortek) -the blue in the NDVI image is related to the value of the color LUT I applied to the image during processing. I did that to help me to see where I have shadows. This is what the separate channels look like with the MidOpt 660/850. Because the filter only passes red and NIR the red channel on the camera records visible light and now the green and blue channels record mostly NIR. The blue channel has a much cleaner NIR signal. Try downloading the parking lot images above and run them through Infragram Sandbox http://infragram.org/sandbox/ using different channel combinations to see how the channels differ in NDVI calculation.
