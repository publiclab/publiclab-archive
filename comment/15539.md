great to see these initial assumptions! and awesome work on finding both a low-cost sensor and a low-cost filter.  The FLIR Lepton thermal images are 64x64 and are pretty useful when overlaid on a visible light photo, I expect the 32x32 would still be workable to find leaks. 

Many of the sensors on that chart will increase sensitivity with cooling. if there was a way to attach a heat sink to the sensor and bathe the heat sink in a dry ice/acetone cooling bath you could get to 196K without any moving parts. (this is a dangerous idea, you should try safer cooling like a peltier first)

the whole system would have to be stuffed to the gills with desiccant too.  while not particularly elegant and relying on lots of disposable chemicals, there shouldn't be anything too complicated or unreliable about it.  

this is exciting! i'm following your github repo too.
