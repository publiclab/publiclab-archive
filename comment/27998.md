I'm definitely not programming-savvy but found [this blog post](https://www.sanity.io/blog/lab-notes-setting-up-air-quality-notifications-with-purple-air-sanity-vercel-and-twilio) about setting up notifications using PurpleAir data. It uses a third-party platform, but maybe the concepts are relevant? 

[@wu_ming2](/profile/wu_ming2), I saw [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/jiteovien/08-28-2018/download-analyze-your-purple-air-data#c26424) that you set up push notifications from your PurpleAir. Any ideas here? Thanks!
