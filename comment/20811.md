- do not use DO sensor

On a monthly period, at a number of sampling locations in the watershed, air/water temperature are collected and: 

- DO, Hardness, and Alkalinity are done manually using titration; e.g. DO is accomplished using the Winkler method.

- pH is accomplished using a digital meter (Hanna 9126 I think) 

- samples are sent to state lab for metals analysis (using ICP). Every 5th sample is duplicated to assist state in evaluating our process and a blank sample is sent to the lab to evaluate the lab analysis. 

We go through a yearly evaluation by the state, done in person, on an unknown sample provided by the state. A bit nerve wracking. 

Our sampling and analysis effort is focused on a Level 5 EPA Superfund site (abandoned silver mines)
