I have a hypothesis about the different results obtained with two BME280 sensors on the flying rig. A difference of 3° to 4°C is more than should be expected due to variability in the sensors. Both sensors were in SkyPod chambers plugged with cotton, but the vent hole in the chamber was blocked by the wind sensor on one of the SkyPods. The wind sensor gets warm to the touch when operating, and it was only about 1 cm from the BME280 sensor. That is the sensor which recorded the warmer temperatures. That is also the sensor which recorded the lower humidity. Those results are consistent with the hypothesis that the warm wind sensor altered the temperature and humidity readings of the BME280 sensor.

It would be straightforward to test this hypothesis.
