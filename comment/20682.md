I think that the Search results should not default to "Date Created" which automatically shows the oldest pages. It's true that some very important pages were created early on, however we've gotten a lot better at organizing wiki pages more recently ;). 

When i search for `noise` using the button (not autocomplete), there is no version of results that places the page https://publiclab.org/wiki/noise on the top two rows of results. So for this search term i have no preferred method of search because none of them give me the main wiki page as the first (or at least top row) of results. Could this be fixed by putting a direct link to a tag page https://publiclab.org/tag/noise at the top of the search results page?
