The amount of earth’s surface covered by water – 71% 

The amount of salt water on the earth – 97.5% 

The amount of fresh water on the earth – 2.5% 

Water related diseases causes 3.4 million deaths each year.

Abiotic:

Producers: the most basic components of an ecosystem. Such as plants or algae, are those organisms that can capture the solar energy and convert it into chemical energy. 

 

Consumers: organisms that depend on plants and other organisms for their food.  

 

Decomposers: organisms such as insects, fungi, and bacteria feed on the dead bodies of other organisms. 

 

Parasites and diseases: parasites are organisms that feed on a host organism and causes harm to that organism. Parasites can sometimes even lead to the death of their host organisms.
