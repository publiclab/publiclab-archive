Interesting. Thanks [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) and [@warren](/profile/warren). The answers seem to agree that the spectrometer might indeed be the right type of tool to measure color of a light bulb.

I'll do more research about comparing the different measurements from one bulb to another. Particularly, how the following might affect the reading:

- distance from the light source to the spectrometer
- brightness of the source vs. color reading (although not true in most cases, pretend that a light has a constant yellow value of 184; would the reading be the same if the light changes brightness)
- manual camera exposure options
- possible color range by different cameras
- LED light source for cameras (some cameras flicker with LED lights)

I'll report back with my findings or questions.
