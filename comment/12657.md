Hmm, is there a reason Hg (0) is not listed in the NIST spectra? Perhaps Hg (0) does not have any intense peaks? My list is filtered for most intense peaks only. Are you sure about Hg (0)? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)">Wikipedia</a> (which could be wrong of course) states:

> Mercury exists in two main oxidation states, I and II. (citing [Wang et al, 2007](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200703710/abstract;jsessionid=50BC6DD412CD5BD50D388A0F2107DE43.f04t01))

There was also some good information here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_lamp

And finally [the mercury-vapor lamp article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-vapor_lamp) includes a listing of emission lines, including the ones we use for linear calibration, listed as 435.8nm and 546.1nm. 

It notably does not specify which oxidation state, or list a second green peak, which makes me think that perhaps the 2nd green peak is indeed another element fluorescing? The article also provides this image of a mercury vapor lamp with no coatings, so it should be just pure mercury:
