My favorite PublicLab memory is co-leading a kite mapping excursion with Alex Stoicoff and much help from Jordan M., Dan S., plus the filmer Andre, and Capt. Jody Donewar (http://captainjodydonewar.com C-; ).  There was prep and logistics and phonecalls and emails (of course), but there was also Alex S. and I meeting up the day before to put together our own rig (a first for me), to review station locations, lats and longs...rubber bands and the rest.  I remember fondly how, on the day of, I insisted on not using the GPS to find the dock.  We went one bridge too far and Siri was immediately barking at us for the last two turns.  Hey, its the netherreaches of Southeastern Louisiana.  The journey is the destination and hitting it dead on you only short yourself.  Like true experts we were better at the more difficult parts, as we found the study sites easier than we found the dock.  Capt. Jody helped with this, getting me a new waterspeed record along the way.  He also did a great impression/recount of the last time he was out with eustatic, who had stripped down to his skibbies to go Barataria Baywatch on a non-swimming camera that had got loose while parasailing.  Luckily no Panasonics were lost this time around, but there were some bumps in the road...er...chop on the water.  For a region known for its gale force winds I can't remember how many times I've tried to kite map and got the slack kite line blues.  We had a balloon and helium with us but we were a kiting crew, so we got the kite and rig up and told Capt. Jody to gun it.  Creating our own wind we got the pictures.  Man is it a great feeling to bring the rig down, with X-mas morning faces looking on, and you hear the camera still firing away and see there are hundreds of images on the SD card.  Sure many of them were water but somebody's got to document the water, right?  We also got some good ones of the coastline and there were smiles all around.  At the end of the day I felt I had accomplished something.  Better said, WE accomplished something, and I didn't just look on.  For the first time kapping I wasn't Gilligan to eustatic's Skipper.
