Sreyanth, awesome work, I love the interface and well done on following the project through to completion. It adds a lot to the functionality of spectral workbench and will; be a valuable tool.

Like everything new, I took the opportunity to play with the interface. It picks up stuff very nicely. I used cfasties neon collection and sure enough, it matched the other spectra in the set, plus many more. Very nicely done. I like the "tolerance" feature as well.

I'm thinking the "find similar" relies on the user having calibrated the spectra ? so neon spectra that haven't been calibrated are not recognised ? This seems pretty obvious and it would be difficult to match spectra otherwise, but not impossible. How difficult do you think it would be to match spectra that have no wavelength information, purely using the appearance of peaks and the spatial relationship between the peaks ? Maybe start with some well known spectra, Hg, Ne, H, He and so on, and without calibration give the user an option to find possible candidates.

A long while ago and suggested it would be really nice to have a plot of the "standard" type spectra, that could be overlaid (or placed side by side) with a user's spectra. This would enable a quick visual comparison to be done. Such a spectra "database" would be scaled to the users own calibration, so they try to find, say copper, in a sample and can see what they should be looking for. This is essentially what you've done without the "official" correct spectra. We could always rely on chris (cfastie) to donate lots of spectra, he also does some awesome work. 

Anyway, I'm mega impressed. I wonder what Balmer would think of this kind of technology and the ability to match spectra from around the world using a computer algorithm. Mind boggling really.      

well done sreyanth.
