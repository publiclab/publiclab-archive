hey [@Maggpi](/profile/Maggpi), I was sure the exam you mentioned previously was last Thursday - sorry for that. Best of luck with your exams, Let's sync start of next week?
As for OpenCV - this is not a hard thing to do, use the resize as explained here: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/da/d6e/tutorial_py_geometric_transformations.html

I guess [@warren](/profile/warren) will be able to share experience on grading. If it's based on the number of lines of code we will need to change the criteria...
