George that's a good point. Although the real time clock is running all the time, it is not smart enough to do something as complicated as setting an alarm and waking something else up. Only the Arduino cpu (Atmel 328p) can do that. But for some reason I guess the Atmel is not capable of sleeping deeply for more than eight seconds. That must be wildly inefficient if you want to log data every hour. But maybe waking up and going right back to sleep doesn't use much battery power. 

That must explain why the interval between data writes is determined with a for loop:

for (int i=0;i<numIntervals;i++) {  
LowPower.powerDown(SLEEP_8S, ADC_OFF, BOD_OFF);  
}

That loop must tell the cpu to keep going back to sleep a certain number of times (numintervals) and only after all those eight second naps do some work when you wake up. I do pretty much the same thing some days.
