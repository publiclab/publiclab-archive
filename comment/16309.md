Hi, [@ryzokuken](/profile/ryzokuken) -- have you had a chance to try writing some sample scripts, as I [suggested above](#c16268)? Also, i think it's worthwhile to write out in more detail each step it'll take to implement the first couple bots, the ones you write the scripts for.

And potentially the steps to get a bot working on the PL website. What infrastructure will you need? A VM? Can you test it on Cloud9? How will a bot post a comment, or find comments? What API calls will you need `plots2` to offer for reading recent posts, comments, or posting comments?

Thank you!
