did you use the kit? 
This was actually from 2010. I was using a southern balloon works balloon but the balloons that are in our kit now would work just fine. It was  custom built oversize spool on a wooden cradle so I could accommodate more line. The spool has an aluminum center, corion sidewalls (could be plywood if sanded smooth), with a threaded rod running all the way through it that is bolted to the sidewalls. The rod/spar/axel is extra long so you can attach an electric drill for rapid balloon recovery. Here is a picture of the setup with a different line on the spool but you can see the spool and drill http://publiclab.org/notes/gonzoearth/6-17-2011/balloon-rigging

How did you know when to stop inflating the balloon?  
It was a hot day and I just filled the balloon to normal size and it was more than enough lift.

How did you plan around the weather conditions? 
I just did the flight at a moment mid-day with no wind. the lower graphic has a time profile on the bottom for the flight. I wanted to fly high be also keep it quick. I did not have a set altitude in mind. There was 6,000' of fishing line on the spool and I just kept an eye on the balloon to make sure it was not drifting too much. With the drill It came down fast and the total flight ended up being around 15min but you could do it even faster if need be.
