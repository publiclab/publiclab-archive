I came across [this article](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137789) about testing the ShinyeiPPD42 in a laboratory environment.  I think their evaluation is very insightful and encouraging.  [@philrosenberg](/profile/philrosenberg) - I believe you are right about the larger particles saturating the signal, the previously mentioned article describes this as happening with particles around ~20µm.  A possible solution could be to apply some filter before particles enter the device.
