A couple of things:

First, it is illegal to use cell phones for high altitude flights.  It messes with too many towers. I don't believe they are allowed in any airborne uses including rc planes and drones.

Second, I got my balloon to 108,000 feet.  APRS worked great down to about 5500 feet within a few miles of the Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming junction.  I got 2 pings from the spot unit on board over the whole of the flight.  Fortunately they were right before landing.  That was luck, not skill.  I would not depend on a Spot for other reasons too.  The position of the antenna is somewhat critical to the function of a Spot.  It is difficult to guarantee this on a balloon.  Also, commercial GPS units are speed and altitude limited by law.  You have to buy specific chips if you are going over 40,000ft or 200 mph, either of which are probable at some point on your balloons journey.  Make sure whatever GPS you use it is unlocked.  I used one from bigredbee.com that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.
