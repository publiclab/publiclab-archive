Hi again,
I'm trying to sort this out while my head is in it, thus so many questions!
Any scale of lower resolution than about 15 doesn't work, the resulting map is super tiny, indecipherable.
But even though I lock all the individual images (n=4), the map produced seems to change the layering so that things don't line up.
For example, here is what it looks like on mapknitter just before exporting:

[![Screen_Shot_2020-05-27_at_2.38.24_PM.png](/i/39558)](/i/39558?s=o)

 But when it's exported, the images on top are different, even if all locked individually, or the entire page is locked via icon in upper left corner. See here - notice rectangular garden bed in this and previous image for easy comparison:

[![Screen_Shot_2020-05-27_at_2.31.37_PM.png](/i/39559)](/i/39559?s=o)

How can I get the export to look like the map that I see in mapknitter?
thank you!
