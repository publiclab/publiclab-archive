Thank you for this informative answer! I have a few followup questions.

On the adafruit description for [their 3 x AAA enclosure](https://www.adafruit.com/product/727), they say that it is a good stand-in for their 3.7 V lithium battery, with estimates of a voltage ranging from 3.7 V for fully charged NiMH batteries to 2.7 V at their end-of-life.

Would it be safe to use the Riffle in this configuration, or would the Riffle start to suffer when the battery voltage dips down past 3.5 V? E.g. does the silkscreen label refer to nominal voltage, or actual voltage?

Maybe we don't know yet, and have to characterize the riffle's performance still.

Also, 4 x AA or AAA batteries would give a voltage of 6 V, which is right at the Riffle's stated upper limit. I assume that higher voltage than this could be dangerous for the riffle's electronics, but 6 V would be safe, and perhaps the longest-lasting option for battery life?

Thanks,
