Super ideas and images. These poles were initially difficult to track down. After much searching though we were able to get a hold of the manufacturer overseas who wasn't too excited initially at the prospect of shipping to the U.S. After assuring them that I wanted to order a bundle though they sent them. 

I like the idea of including a standard tripod mount with the pole kits but as [cfastie](/profile/cfastie) outlines it is problematic at those extended lengths to judge the angle and hold steady, so I am leaning more towards the suspension mount. I did come up with a similar mounting option to [Ecta64](/profile/Ecta64). I'd be interested to see what kind of pictures you were able to get and your experience getting the camera to point in the right direction consistently. Granted you are using a much shorter pole than we are anticipating it might be quite different.
Here's what I came up with using a rubber stopper with a screw to hole the tripod mount.
