Great to see! It looks much sturdier than the coroplast. Glad to see this is working for you!

I hear you have some issues with focus on the Raspberry Pi - do you need help with the lens adapter or with controlling the height of the stage? Can you upload a picture of your Pi setup so we can help you debug it? Thanks!
