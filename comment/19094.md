Thanks for your comment. As you can see a photo of inner part, now product have optics only. I will add to QCM (Quartz Crystal Microbalance) in the future.

The problem is this product needs of every knowledge of optics, electronics, software. We have a simple model and can open every know-how, but we want to collect development costs. 
Please let me know the idea to solve this dilemma.
