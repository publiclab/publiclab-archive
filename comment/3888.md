wow, looks spectacular. Can you post a full frame grab instead of a spectrum? Maybe the brightest point is not on the sampling line. 

Also, just to think about brightness, could you post a comparison with a syba-based spectrum from the same distance and setup?

Sometimes it helps to diffuse the incoming light by putting a napkin over the bulb, so you don't have to align it as well with the device. If this is an alignment issue, that'd solve this, but if it really is about the sensitivity of the camera, maybe we have to come up with another solution. 

Very exciting! Keep us up to date about the USB cable too!

This board could easily be used with a raspberry pi as well, and would be so much thinner and more compact!
