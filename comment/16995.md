[@MadTinker](/profile/MadTinker), awesome!! I'm trying to get familiar with Public Lab's logic as well, I guess the best way to document is by replicating an activity? According to [@Liz](/profile/Liz) told me.

I'm not tech people as you can see, but if you have any problems when building it, I am more than happy to offer help. Also, if you could email me (i@shan.blue) or [@rockets](/profile/rockets) (rockets.xia@dfrobot.com) your address, DFRobot will lend you their isolation module as they promised.
