The e360 course required different sensors for each lab, so we tweaked the 2-part logger with 3D printed rails holding mini breadboards to provide this flexibility. The software has also been streamlined significantly and people shouldn't have too much trouble adding other sensors provided you stick to 1,2,4,8 or16 bytes/record and your modules don't pull more power than the coin cell can provide.
