[@jasonwool](/profile/jasonwool) - if you're interested, we would LOVE to meet you in person at the Public Lab Barnraising -- https://publiclab.org/barnraising -- Nov 3-5 in Cocodrie, Louisiana; this is our annual community event and Harvey and Irma imagery (as well as other disaster response issues) will surely be one of the big topics this year. 

Thanks again!
