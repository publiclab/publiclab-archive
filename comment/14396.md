That's very clever that users with good reputations can counteract unscrupulous newbies gaming the system for their buds. It would be cool if users who publish lots of "research grade" notes have more power. But that produces an insider class which can throw its weight around. Even if the insiders have earned their powers (DC and Marvel need not apply), they still become a special class.  

One ammendment to my rules: I proposed that any ranking below 3 (out of 5) would be a poison pill. That makes it too easy for any ranker to sink a note. That makes it more likely that a sunk note can be blamed on one person, and it is very easy to retaliate by returning the favor. So even notes with some poor rankings should stay in the running.
