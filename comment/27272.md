> Hey [@midmarsh](/profile/midmarsh) [@nearsys](/profile/nearsys) [@zwettstein](/profile/zwettstein) and [@usere6020](/profile/usere6020):  I wonder if you would be interested in participating in a global weather 'nowcast' ? [@sophied](/profile/sophied) and I are collecting images generated by open-weather collaborators and contributors recorded from NOAA satellites on Sunday September 6th 2020 in order to stitch them together into a global weather 'composite' - like a giant collective weather-map. The weather 'nowcast' will be linked to the OurNetworks festival starting on September 8th, and [@sophied](/profile/sophied) and I will discuss the 'nowcast' during the festival programme on September 12th at 2:30pm UTC-4 (ET). We will also publish the nowcast here on Public Lab along with some reflections on the methodology and learning outcomes.  Since you four were early adopters of the DIY Satellite Ground Station Guide, we'd love for you to take part! All contributions will be full credited and attributed. If you're up for this let me know :)    Here is an early 'demo' for the nowcast.  PS here is a link to the OurNetworks festival: [https://ournetworks.ca/](https://ournetworks.ca/)
