This was a classic case of having to be very careful when interpreting aerial photographs. There really was an concealed outflow at this location, which we have on video tape as flowing. However, after closer study, the plume is not from that outflow, but from tidally transported sewage scum that happened to be positioned right at the outflow when we took this aerial photograph.

It would be like a detective taking photographs of red "blood" spots outside a murder scene, just as a painter was repainting the house red.

This plume is most likely visible in NIR because Gowanus sewage scum is typically made up of ground up styrofoam particles, to which sewage bacterias, restaurant grease and algae then attach themselves.  Depending on the time of year, large amounts of leaf litter and pollens also get clumped together with the sewage floatables, causing the plume to show up in the infrared signature.
