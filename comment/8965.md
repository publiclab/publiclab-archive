Those are great links, DavidMack.

The TSI document illustrates the tube of air I was talking about that carries the sample for measuring ("sheath-flow" in jargon). There is sooo much equipment required to do that. A plastic or glass tube should work just fine instead, with caveat of cleaning.

The TSI document also illustrates how to judge particle size based on time of flight (graph on the last page), but that is based on their sensor specifically. Time of flight is a fancy way of saying "how long in the particle in the beam's way," or how wide is the pulse width in the images above. It also mentions some tricky problems with how to tell when multiple particles come through at the same time. Between multiple particles in the stream and a sensor with a slow sample rate, it will be hard to judge time of flight. DavidMack is probably correct in suggesting that the best you can do is calculate a total mass of particulate through the measurement channel, informed by how long the sensor is detecting particulate and how fast the air volume moves past the sensor.
