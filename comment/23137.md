I don't know the Mac OS well but I'd guess there is a thing somewhere to manage devices and that should show your cameras. If you see two cameras then you have both a web cam and the spectrometer web cam connected and there will be an option to select between them. On my system SW and Firefox were not happy with having two cameras and tended to default to the wrong camera. So I unplugged my web cam.
