A nice thing about DuPont jumper wires is that each wire has a separate connector. So pin pitch does not matter (if it is at least 0.1 inch, the Arduino standard). And one end of your cable can connect to four adjacent pins while the other end connects to four non-adjacent pins (important for Arduino). The single connectors can be removed from the wire end, so you can make your own wires of any length with some ([really cheap](http://www.ebay.com/itm/100pcs-Dupont-Female-Crimp-Pin-Wire-Jumper-Terminal-Connector-Metal-2-54mm/232299113521?)) crimp connectors.
