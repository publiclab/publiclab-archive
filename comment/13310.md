I don't know the specs of the blue paper I use for custom white balance. The idea is to flood the blue channel with light (when using a blue filter) so the camera overcompensates and exaggerates the red channel in all subsequent photos. The red channel is used for NIR when computing NDVI (when using a blue filter) and the values in the red channel must be larger than the values in the blue channel for pixels where healthy foliage has been captured. 

The blue channel will capture NIR light as well as blue light, so the amount of NIR reflecting off the blue paper is important. I have never measured how much NIR or blue light reflects off my blue paper. I just know that results are best when the blue paper is reflecting the light from a deep blue sky (and not direct sunlight). 

With the R Pi camera it might be possible to set the color balance programatically. It would be good to learn how you are setting the white balance. Many people are interested in this.

It's also possible to do this custom white balance with a blue light source: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/11-22-2013/white-balance-for-all
