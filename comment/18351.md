Looks great! We're working on this for the [Basic Microscope](https://publiclab.org/wiki/basic-microscope)
and the exploratory [Hydrogen Sulfide Copper Pipe Kit](https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-copper-pipe) too! Wondering how we should track this with you? Is there something we should do on those wiki page?
