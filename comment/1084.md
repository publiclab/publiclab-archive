looks like a fine kite-- it will probably need a long tail and needs to be turned around, so the frame is on the back of the sail material.

to adjust the bridle, tie a bridle loop from the crossed spars to the tail, and attach another adjustable loop to the bridle loop with either a [larks head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyzUmetVJFA) or a [prusik knot](http://www.animatedknots.com/prusik/index.php).  slide this adjustable loop until the kite is almost parallel to the ground but has it's nose up slightly. Then take it into the field and tweak it till it flies.
