> Introduce service workers and AMP(Accelerated Mobile Pages) to cater for the PWA part for responsiveness and variety of screen sizes

I like how you're thinking ahead to the whole experience, especially page load times. I haven't used AMP in a Rails project before, and would be curious to learn more about how to do it! For the screen sizes and responsiveness, the Bootstrap library which we use is really great -- http://getbootstrap.com  and we are upgrading quite soon to v4! 

> Write blogs on the various new things I have learnt and share with others the things I would have accomplished so far

I truly appreciate that you are factoring this in. It's so easy to forget once we learn something, to show others and lend a helping hand with our new skills! 

Finally i wanted to say, I think I've pointed this to you before but given your interest in graphics and motion, this is a really cool platform for making interactive JavaScript visualizations: http://p5js.org 

I think you'll enjoy it!

Thanks for your proposal!
