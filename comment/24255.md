 Thanks for the link! I also wasn't able to use the wifi method of connecting so I also connected over usb. I had to follow the whole tutorial from your link (2 pages) to get the pi to have internet access over the "ethernet" connection. That was the hardest part. After that the rest of the tutorial here (downloading the camera control program) was easy to follow and now I can see my camera feed in the browser!!
