[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) Hi I just have one more quick question while designing my next experiment. If I substitute the IR LEDs with red LEDs in my chamber when I take my NDVI images to act as the NIR variable using my current blue filter, that accomplishes the same thing yes? In other words, I just want to confirm that my red LEDs will act as the main source of IR when using a blue filter (barring contamination)?

Asking because subjecting my plants to only blue and IR light for the purpose of imaging would not be representative of what normal growth (at least for tissue culture propagation) would be under.
