Biodiversity is important because it supports our ecosystem and provides the food for us. With an unstable biodiversity, that means unstable ecosystem, meaning unstable resources. There are 95% fewer blue fin tuna in the Pacific. We are all connected. Human interactions can interfere with species such as taking, eating the blue fin tuna. This species is near extinct, what would happen to the biodiversity then? Biodiversity begins to decrease. Biodiversity decreasing can result in "human well-being by affecting soil and water, which are fundamental to food production".
