You know what we need? vertical averaging to smooth out noise. In live/waterfall mode, this'd be time averaging. For your spec, it'd just be averaging in the y-dimension. I bet we'd get much smoother spectra in either case. Proof of concept -- try blurring your spectrum image vertically in Photoshop?
