 That is great and thank you for following up. I am currently working with some folks @ Rutgers to extend some of the work I had originally done on this. I have included some additional capabilities to extracting the X/Y from the EXIF information and the ability to publish it to a few different storage containers including S3 and ArcGIS Online to quickly view the images in context. Would be interested in seeing if I can roll some fo that work into the SD card image as well.
