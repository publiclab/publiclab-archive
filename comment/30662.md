The Wikipedia article is an interesting read.  The initial data said horseshoe crab mortality from L.A.L. testing should be about 3%.  However, recent studies have shown the crab mortality value to be 15% or even 30% (read the Wikipedia article cited above).  After studying an alternative (recombinant factor C), the USP decided to stay with Horseshoe crab LAL.
