Hi, [@dldisha](/profile/dldisha) - thanks for your proposal. I appreciate the extra UI design you've imagined and added in here and there. We do want to be sticking to the Bootstrap card design as in the style guide, so please bear that in mind!

Also, many thanks for your contributions to date - it's great to see you on the codebase in GitHub. Thanks again!
