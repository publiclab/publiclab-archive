In a sense these sensors all have zero lag. As soon as the the materials that make up the sensor reach ambient temperature, the sensor will tell you what that temperature is. Sensors made from conductive materials will reach ambient temperature faster, and sensors made from very little material will reach ambient faster.  So the smallest sensor might be the quickest, especially if it's made of metal. But any submersible sensor will have some thermal mass, so towing might have to be slower than you would like.
