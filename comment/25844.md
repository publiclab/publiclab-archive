Hi and thanks for the post! 
I have had an experience with the DFRobot TDS sensor (bought here https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000030776090.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.1afd7255DsiG7P&algo_pvid=59615f5d-9065-46b3-8025-523bcbdc8b5f&algo_expid=59615f5d-9065-46b3-8025-523bcbdc8b5f-0&btsid=a83f1ea7-a96d-496d-bdf4-d37365be94de&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_7,searchweb201603_52) as a part of my triple water logging project - an autonomous temperature, pressure and TDS logger for water discharge measurements using tracer dilution method. I have installed a professional TDS/SPC/temperature logger made by YSI along with my DIY logger, and the results I have got were confusing. The TDS readings made by DFRobot sensor were ca. 500 times higher than the YSI TDS, and ca. twice as high as the SPC readings by YSI. Also, the feedback of the sensor (i.e. the reaction to changing concentration of the dissolved solids, NaCl tracer in my case) was slower than that of the YSI. However, despite the mismatch of the reading values, the timing of change in TDS were captured by the DFRobot sendor pretty similar to those of the YSI, which was quite crucial for me in order to calculate the streamflow discharge. 
My final comments would be then a) the sensor requires a thorough calibration with standardized solutions before deployment, b) chances of bying a cheap fake are high (but I have to get one genuine to compare).
