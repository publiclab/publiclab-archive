I just started experimenting with my own NDVI camera rig and your posts/plugin are great.  I have a question about the NDVI formula for a single camera setup.  If I am using a red filter on my camera (RPI NOIR) is Near-IR light flooding the camera's blue channel?  And would this IR light in the blue channel effect my NDVI reading.  I am referring to an article I found online http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3649405/ where they used the Blue channel minus the "NIR" channel as the R in NIR-R/NIR+R

Or does the IR bleed over cancel out since NDVI is a proportion.
