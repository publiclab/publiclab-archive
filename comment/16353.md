Hi, all - beginning to incorporate some of these ideas into a concrete "tasks" listing and a kind of welcome page for those helping lead our software community, here: 

"Help organize and lead the community" -- https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/projects/4

It's a bit similar to the [newcomers welcoming page](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/projects/2)!
