Hi, I've gathered some links here that I hope are helpful, or at least can point you to the parts list you're looking for.

The Basic Microscope has since evolved into the [Pi Kit version](https://store.publiclab.org/collections/microscopes/products/community-microscope-pi-kit?variant=13776202203245) of the [Community Microscope](https://publiclab.org/wiki/micro).

If you're interested in building the original Basic Microscope, there's [a parts list at this wiki](https://publiclab.org/wiki/basic-microscope), and the [files for that stage are shared here](https://publiclab.org/notes/partsandcrafts/01-22-2018/building-the-microscope-stage).

If you're looking to build the Pi Kit, there are [directions for the build of the pi-based microscope here](https://publiclab.org/notes/bronwen/11-29-2018/assembling-the-raspberry-pi-microscope) that includes the necessary parts. The updated stage[ is described here](https://publiclab.org/questions/melissajurist/10-15-2018/are-there-templates-available-to-laser-cut-the-stages-of-the-microscope-the-coroplast), including a [link to the files for the stage](https://github.com/publiclab/community-microscope/blob/master/coro-microscope-stages.pdf).
