[Peegar](http://peegar.com/) is an academic project at the University of Tokyo which provides browser-based graphical programming of a microcontroller. It  "uses audio cable instead of USB cable to transfer the program to your hardware, which is another special feature to make development simple." 

It sounds like the WebJack concept is being implemented there.
