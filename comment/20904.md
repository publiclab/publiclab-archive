Hi Kelvin!!! Apologies again for the slow reply. I'm just catching up now. 

This looks like a good basic layout and I like how you've created a really clean three column main content area. I think I'd have to see a more detailed sketch (maybe a digital mockup) to know if the sidebar works, though. I could imagine it getting a little crowded.

Could we move the Contributors section up, do you think? 

How would you organize the content in the middle area? Kind of as it is now, or as a list? 

Finally, we often have a short paragraph of text summary/introduction at the top of tag pages. Could we see what it looks like with that added in somewhere?

Thanks!
