Hi [@divyabaid16](/profile/divyabaid16), nice progress. Let's prioritize the remaining tasks:  

1. Spam Management on Mapknitter -- I'll start it this weekend
2. Ability to apply filters to images (with Image Sequencer) and upload a new version
3. Ability to order images in the sidebar -- done
4. Ability to select a collection of images to export -- in PR
5. View of all images for a given region in maps
6. Ability to choose time bounding box (some kind of layer manager may be needed)
7. Refresh background images while dragging
8. Ability to upload new versions of an image -- in PR
9. New templates and APIs to present images on any map, selected by a bounding box
10. Image versioning, locking and reverting - the ability to view and revert to previous versions of an image -- in PR

So, after version tracking, let's complete [#10](/n/10) and then [#2](/n/2). I think [#7](/n/7) can be done concurrently while working on other issues. 

Thanks, Divya!
