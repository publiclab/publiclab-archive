As far as I understood is the value light use efficiency value (LUE / phi2) you measure by using PAM fluorescence (LUEpam) conceptually the same as measuring Fv/Fm but with a variable baseline (Fo floats, and is a function of your photon flux density or light intensity and a fudge factor).

Measuring your light use efficiency does allow you to track diurnal patterns across the day which directly links to productivity. I see these measurements as rather specific physiological measurements and rather hard to implement in open ended situations (e.g. not controlled experiments or farm conditions with management regimes). 

Ideally a true test would be using controlled plants where you fertilize one patch, and not the other or similar. I guess it's the point you made with the curve. Now trying to squeeze this all into one session and adjusting for PPFD will only add more noise and not tell you anything more than Fv/Fm values I feel. But that's my opinion. I've done my share of field sampling and going out to collect as many points as possible when a simpler method exists which will tell you just the same is something you come to value.
