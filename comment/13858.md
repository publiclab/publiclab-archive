Hey Jeff, unfortunately with refined oil the organic chemistry aspect gets changed dramatically, thats why when you shine a UV flashlight or laser thru it it will fluoresce but it will be a white-blueish color which is indicates mineralization. That's why I was suggesting a variable LED to control wavelength ie.,a 1w or 3w high output LED 350Ma 400-405nm range, it's all about that electronic transition state, ground state to a higher energy state.

Crude oil is a different story, it still has it's organic properties intact, there are double and triple carbon/hydrogen bonds, those bonds become rearranged during processing, so in order to "see" their respective fluorescent spectras you have to separate those bonds into their derivatives, like the benzo rings, naphthols. That is also why if you notice on the sets, there is a slight shoulder type "hump" at the drop off of each line, thats the aromatic hydro carbons, but they are too complex, so thats all your going to see is a hump, no info can be gleened from that.

I have been doing a lot of research and reading on this subject and am learning a lot. I also believe there is a limitation to this detector as far as the camera is concerned, but it still is effective as far as fluorescent compounds with emissions above 400nm, and there's plenty of them. It's just a matter of getting the right technique down.
