Hallo Rita.
In my setup One camera is not modified. The other camera I removed the IR block filter inside.
I use the 720nm or the 850nm filter on the outside. My cameras will be in a drone so I should not have problem with any glare.
Maybe if I go over water but not so much NDVI to do there. (Wait a moment maybe I can see some alge growth, that will be another project).
For protection: before my drone (plane) will land the lens will be retracted in to the fuselage.
In the visible picture I use the red channel. In the filtered picture I use the red channel. For my camera you can even use the blue channel in the filtered picture. If you look a my histogram thy overlay almost 100%. 
Regards Grayson.
