Ok so I found this new product category for fans and carbon filters that's pretty cheap, and they're intended for hydroponics. 

VIVOSUN 4 Inch 203 CFM Inline Duct Fan with 4"x 14" Carbon Filter Odor Control with Australia Virgin Charcoal

$88 and to be honest I think they're for hiding the fact that you're growing pot by filtering out the smell. Go figure. 

I'm interested in this for a kitchen stove vent I want to build. I'm happy to buy one and try it out. I want to build it into a hanging lamp, actually, to go over a stove. Would this work for particulates too? I imagine it's considerably better than the carbon filters usually used in stove vents but really am not sure.
