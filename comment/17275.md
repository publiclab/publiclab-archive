Hi Patrick, I'm glad you brought this up and made space to talk about it. I actually think this is more about organization than anything else. I agree with Chris that research notes are supposed to be a medium through which to keep up with each other's activities, but I also think that it takes a lot of patience to sort through research notes to see which ones are relevant to each other, which ones include a lot of information or a creative new idea, etc. One idea that has been floating around a while is the idea of having "research area review groups" where a group of self-selected folks would periodically (quarterly? biannually?) read through all of the recent research notes and wikis on a given topic or broader research area, and compose a short summary of the collective work, highlighting particularly compelling work and synthesizing the body of work that makes progress on a given project. The idea is that each research area review group would have a wiki they'd update, that would be interlinked with the relevant topics and methods wiki pages. What do y'all think about the idea of research area review groups?
