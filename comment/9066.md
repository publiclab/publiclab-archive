I found a scanner, the [Canon 9000F](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-9000F-MKII-Scanner/dp/B00AGV7TQG/ref=sr_1_14?s=office-electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1400784673&sr=1-14&keywords=scanner) and 9000F MKII, with an optical resolution of 9600dpi and an interpolated resolution of 19200dpi, or pixels 2.6μm and 1.3μm respectively.  Its going for ~$160.  There are also slide scanners that hit 10,000dpi, like the [Pacific Image Prime Film XE](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1007389-REG/pacific_image_primefilm_xe_prime_film_xe_scanner.html) scanner.

it looks with those kinds of resolutions we recognize pm2.5 particles, identifying them might not be possible. but still... pretty exciting.
