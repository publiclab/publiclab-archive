Chris, agreed on the best lesson being how little wind it takes to fly a kite. Yesterday, I was able to sneak in a 45 minute kite session where I learned the opposite lesson. On the same hilltop, the wind was blowing fairly hard, much more than a breeze. So I took out the 7-foot Hi Sky Delta. As soon as it was in the air, I knew that I would never hang a camera off of it in similar conditions. It darted to either direction fairly violently. I let out all of my line, thinking that cleaner air would make a difference, and it did, to a degree. Brought it back in and attached the fuzzy tail before launching again. That helped a bit too, but not enough that I would risk a camera rig. It took a long time to reel in all the line (haven't finished the new reel yet).

When I looked up the wind speed for our area for the time that I was out, it was between 24-39 km/h (15-24 mph). Now I know.
