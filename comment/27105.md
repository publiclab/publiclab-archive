Hi molangmuir10, 

I don't know if you still visit this page but I'm not sure how else to get in touch with you.

Your mapping project sounds so interesting! Are the results available for members of the public to view?

I'm someone who lives in Nottingham, in training to grow food and work the land in a regenerative way, and I'm in the process of trying to connect with local growers and other green folks in the city, with a view to becoming part of the movement whose mission it is to re-green the land, support food justice and improve the collective wellbeing of our communities. 

It would be so helpful to get an overview of the local food-growing and green spaces landscape.
