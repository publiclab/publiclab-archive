If you are taking a still photo every hour or so, you might be able to take a flash photo. A split second flash of visible light might not interfere with the growth process you are studying.

If you must use non-visible light, the Pi NoIR camera has no IR cut filter and is sensitive to near IR light (but not very sensitive). You would then illuminate your roots with a near infrared light source. There are NIR LEDs which seem to emit no visible light. They might not be very bright but you can use a lot of them and maybe a long exposure. If you use an infrared filter over the  lens, only infrared light can reach the sensor (but this is not needed if the scene is illuminated with only NIR light).
