I recently ordered a smartphone spectrometer,  measuring glow in the dark pigment spectra seems like a fun project to try it out on.  I'll give it a shot if I have time in the future.  If anyone has suggestions for paints to try or experimental setups to use let me know. I think it will be important to measure how intensity varies based on charging method and how long ago the paint was applied.
