First, I'd like to thank Alejo for posting this page.  It is very helpful.  Then, I' d like to refer you to the comments page in compound chem ( dated May 18,2017 from the author of the page),for this procedure.  One of the comments was that the indicators tendeded to "go off" after a while.  The author responded by saying he extended the time by refrigerating the indicator solution.  Another comment mentioned freezing the solutions into Ice cubes to extend life.  The first comment( about the solutions going off after a short period of time) unfortunately matches my experience.  In my case, the time was a few days.  In industry, pure indicator solutions usually are dissolved in alcohol.  I don't know if adding some alcohol to these solutions would extend their life or not.
