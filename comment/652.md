Thanks Chris I changed the date. I must have used that date from EXIF data or something like that before. I'll have to look at the overlay offset and see what went wrong. The Google Earth imagery team was not able to initially import almost 20% of the GeoTIFFs that work in the PLOTS Archive. I am going to try to go through the list and see if I can help them get those ones working. I anticipate that Google will update PLOTS data around 2-3 times a year, but it is only my guess.
