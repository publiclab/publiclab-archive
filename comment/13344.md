This is an amazing and incredibly useful page!  Thanks all!  

Though there is one thing I'm confused about.  I've been working with the Shinyei PPD42NS and the datasheet and all examples I can find talk about low pulse occupancy.  The hand-drawn diagram above - its seems to me - describes counting the 'high pulses'.  I know its some minute detail but I'm just wondering if it makes any difference?  The goal is to count the ratio between low and high pulses to calculate the number of particles?  I'm a bit confused here.  

And has anyone come across any python code to integrate the PPD42NS with a raspberry pi - as well as a simple schematic to drop the +5v from the sensor to the rpi's 3.3 digital read pin?  (and can the rpi supply enough power?)  I can't seem to find much.

Thanks!
