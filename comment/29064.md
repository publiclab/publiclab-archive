I thought it goes back to the old plumbing in the UK where they had two sets of pipes: a cold water tap connected directly to the water mains for drinking water, and a second hot water tap connected to a storage tank in the attic.  The problem was that the storage tank was probably contaminated and considered not safe for drinking; regulations were in place to prohibit the mixing of hot and cold water.   Your house is probably not plumbed that way, so the problem no longer exists.  The memory of the warning "don't drink from the hot water tap" still lingers though...
