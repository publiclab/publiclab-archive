Rollin, so nice to see your post. I love that your intention is to link food security with the wetlands rehabilitation. Food is so critical and is really being affected by climate change and other factors. So, you definitely have the perfect goals in mind for your city. Looking forward to the work you and the other fellows will be doing. Love where you live, too. I visited LUMCON with Public Lab and I'll never forget the fish jumping late at night in the bayou--well worth fighting for. :)
