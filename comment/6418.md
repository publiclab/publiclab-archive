Pat, I agree that details of the construction of the HackrBlimp would be of interest. That blimp cost less than US$10 and performed very well in some windy conditions. The seams are quite strong. I have some photos if someone wants to use them in a note. I did not hear the final cost of helium, but it sounded like a filling of the 5+ foot diameter neoprene balloon cost about $40 and had great lift with a dual camera rig. I did not sense that it was hard to procure helium.

The reason we did not fly a GPS with the cameras is than Don did not offer his Garmin watch!! Having the 3D track of the balloon path is very cool, but I fail to see how the data could be used in any meaningful way. On the other hand, having a good GPS track of something on the ground that is visible in the air photos could allow better geolocation of the photos.
