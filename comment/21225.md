Hi, [@mblumhar](/profile/mblumhar) - thanks for the suggestion. I think it makes sense. 

I've isolated out the code which would need to be ported in order to get this working more smoothly: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/issues/56

If you are comfortable using JavaScript, something like the following may be a way to open a SpectralWorkbench page, disconnect and reconnect to the Pi network, and get images from the Pi arriving on the capture interface:

```
var piImage = new Image();
$W.getCrossSection = function(v) {
  $W.ctx.drawImage(piImage,40,40);
  piImage.src = "/images/logo.png?" + new Date().getTime(); 
}
```

We also have recently gotten in some nicer quality webcams which we would be happy to exchange your Pi camera with. The ones that ship with our most affordable kit are fine, but don't have great noise characteristics. If you'd be willing to try out the new one, it would be helpful to advancing the kit, and we'd be grateful!
