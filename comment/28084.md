I've been licensed since 1986. First call was VE7HAR, currently VE7MHJ. Mostly APRS, but I check into the occasional net.

But the operation is similar. A "ham it up" up converter would work well for your nooelectric. I tried some of the software fixes that would allow you to go lower in frequency. They were not very good. If you are doing meteor scatter, you can go down to 10 meters, but there are many other kinds of propagation . I like a little higher than that. Do you have your call yet?
