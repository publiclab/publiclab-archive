Hi, Livio - what kind of sample is it? A water sample from the creek, or a soil sample soaked in mineral oil? If the latter, what did the soil look like before you prepared it, and where exactly did you get it? 

Do you have a negative control -- i.e. a soil sample which is not contaminated and does not fluoresce?
