THANK YOU!!!  I'm terribly impressed that you could tell the circular grooves were horizontal.  I'm going to have to tinker a little bit to make the spectra exactly linear where I want it, but I think this fixed it!

For anyone else looking for the solution - I basically I had two problems.  One, my webcam was not angled properly. It shouldn't be looking directly at the light source but angled 45° from it.  Two, my dvd needed to be rotated - it was 90° off.

Thanks to everyone for their help!
