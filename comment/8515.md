OK.  I should probably say that I don't know that our reproducibility problem stems from oxidation, but that is my best guess right now.  We did some experiments where the hydrolysis was done at elevated temperature, but I don't think anything unusual came out of that.  Also,  I need to talk to my students to get the exact volumes and concentrations, but this is roughly what we do (at least, this is what I think the students are doing.  You never can be entirely sure).

We weigh out roughly 0.02 g thioacetamide (at 75.2 g/mole, that gives 2.7 x 10^-4 moles).  Put that in a round bottom flask, stopper with a rubber septum, and pass a stream of inert gas (nitrogen or argon) over it using syringe needles attached to hoses for about an hour.  In a separate flask, we degas about 50 mL of 0.1 mole / L aqueous NaOH by bubbling argon through it for about an hour using the same type of septum/ needles/ tubes setup.   After we have given it plenty of time to de-oxygenate the solution and flush out the flasks, we transfer 20 mL NaOH solution to the thioacetamide flask. This gives a concentration of .013 mole / L thioacetamide, which reacts as in Equation (3) above to give 0.013 mole / L HS- anion.  To get the appropriate concentration of HS-, we dilute an aliquot of the above solution into more NaOH solution in a third degassed flask, shooting for a final concentration of 2.5 x 10^-3 moles of HS- / liter of solution.  This dilute solution is then drawn into a 1 mL syringe (making 2.5 x 10-6 moles in the syringe) which is put on a syringe pump.
This solution is infused into 4 M sulfuric acid over the course of a few hours.  A stream of air from an aquarium pump is passed over the sulfuric acid solution and though 10 mL copper solution (50 uM copper nitrate, 50 mM tris buffer; pH 8, 50 mM NaCl) via a course fritted gas dispersion tube.  The gas is then passed though a bleach solution to kill off any unreacted H2S.
Let me know if this wasn't boring enough.
