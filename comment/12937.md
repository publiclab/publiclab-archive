Those two photos have some good plant health information in them, especially the second one of tree foliage (family Anacardiaceae?). That one produces NDVI values within the range of where they should be:

[![frame008NDVI.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/006/large/frame008NDVI.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/006/original/frame008NDVI.jpg)  
*The color scale goes from -1 to +1.*

The other one is not orange enough to produce NDVI values in the proper range (assuming the plant was healthy). 

[![frame027NDVI.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/007/large/frame027NDVI.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/007/original/frame027NDVI.jpg)  
*NDVI values for the leaves are around +0.1 whihc is probably much too low.*

Both photos produce very good distinction between foliage and non-foliage, which is good.
