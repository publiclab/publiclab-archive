The latest in our ongoing series of build videos supporting Dr. Beddows enviro-sci students who have to first build the logger(s) used to collect data for their final research project. These Promini based loggers may well be as minimal as it is possible to go while still offering the flexibility of supporting multiple sensors. The 200mAh CR2032 levels out at 3.0v and runs all the way down to 2.8v before shutdown - which rules out some older sensors like the DS18b20 which has a lower limit of 3.3v.  But the NTC has so much more resolution that it’s not a problem, and thermistor calibration is an exercise that dovetails nicely with the course material.
