Hi all! i was thinking about this in the context of MapKnitter -- i think we have a way to calculate area of a polygon, so for example a single image. But this doesn't help much if a) you have lots of images, esp. overlapping ones, or b) as  [@silentsairam](/profile/silentsairam) points out, you want to know the area of sub-zones (like, a lawn) that aren't the same extents as the images themselves. 

maybe if we get the Annotations system running again, we could make the area of any polygon drawn appear in the bottom corner or something?
