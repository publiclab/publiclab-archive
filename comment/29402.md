And just a note - its' OK if the version posted to Outreachy doesn't exactly match what you post to our website. We'll be mostly reading the one on our website -- and it's fine if the one on our website continues to evolve a bit. For example, if you respond with new info in the comments under your post, it's not completely necessary to add that to the version you post to Outreachy, esp. if it's just clarifying something. Just be sure to make the Outreachy deadline, that's more formal! Thanks!
