Hi Chris,
thank you for the quick and comprehensive response. That sounds really promising. I will look into chlorophyll fluorescence and if/how I could utilize it in my setup. 

Based on your insights I already found a very interesting development by MSU, the DEPI chamber (Dynamic Environmental Photosynthetic Imager).

Seems to be exactly what I was looking for.

Thanks again!
