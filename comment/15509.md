Replication is a pretty big topic -- i put down some notes from a discussion we had among staff yesterday in this GitHub issue, looking forward to how we'll build out these features: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/786

But Github is a poor place to discuss this. We should put up another blog post all about replication!
