Hi, Trịnh Ngọc Duy -- Your flight looks great, amazing! (including it inline here for other readers:

If you're interested, you should email the Grassroots Mapping list about it -- i'm sure people would be very happy to hear about your test, and I'm especially curious to hear more details -- exactly where did you fly it? Did you use a balloon? How much did it all cost? How did you hear about this project?

You can post to the list by emailing: grassrootsmapping@googlegroups.com

I'd be happy to help you put your video up on the site too -- stay in touch and keep flying!

Best,
Jeff
