[@warren](/profile/warren), not sure it justifies a separate page yet, my comment is rather low on details / text. I would need to put some context to it all if this has to stand on it's own. I'll see if I can carve out some time to write things up. This was all part of a blog post of mine, which is [here](http://www.khufkens.com/2015/04/20/raspberry-pi-spectral-response-curves-grating-properties/), this might be enough to start a new note.
