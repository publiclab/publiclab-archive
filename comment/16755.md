I guess the method would be deriving NDVI from inexpensive sensors (not cameras) operated by a microcontroller. There might be a better sensor (or two) that will make this a viable method, but the TSL2561 costs only a few dollars so it might be worthwhile trying to make it reliable. There is much more work to be done on this, and it would be great if somebody pursued it.
