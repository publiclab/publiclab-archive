Thanks Ned for your ongoing insight and expertise. 

So one thought I had related to Tom's workflow would be to see if we have a broad scale image that has both the large "training" patch and the smaller patch in the top left in it, and see if the technique Tom implemented still shows differences. This would control for lighting/timing/angle differences (although if at a higher altitude we may be losing spectral information?). 

Trying to help problem solve -- hope it helps a little!
