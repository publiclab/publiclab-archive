Tom,
How did the CFL lines drop off in your earlier spectra? I have noticed that my spectral images taken with P&S and DSLR cameras do not record a strong signal for the mercury line at 405 nm compared to images made by the Public Lab webcam spectrometers. I hypothesized that either 1) my Nikon and Canon lens coatings were blocking UV too vigorously, or 2) the CCD sensors were not very sensitive to that end of the spectrum compared to the CMOS sensors in webcams or 3) both.

Good to know that ImageJ can do this easily. We use that for registering normal and NIR images from the Public Lab infrared camera and making new multispectral images.

Overlay graph:
1) Make a simple Excel graph with bold lines, no gridlines, no y axis, etc. Make the line color what you want and the background some other color.
2) capture the graph image with the Windows Snipping tool (in Accessories), save as png.
3) Open in Photoshop, use the background eraser tool to remove the background color. This tool has settings that make this easy (e.g., "discontiguous"). Save as png with transparency (“Save for Web and Devices”).
4) Open spectral image in Photoshop and “Place” graph png file over it. Resize to match.
5) I added a drop shadow to the graph because some of it was not so visible.
