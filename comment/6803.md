Sorry for not explaining this better. We were just trying to understand which sensor channels are recording which wavelengths of light. The images I posted are from an unmodified camera but we also tested a NIR camera. Chris Fastie just posted a related note (http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/09-11-2013/infrared-behavior-of-a810).
