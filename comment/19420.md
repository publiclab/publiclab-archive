Ooook amigas here it is. Just the text. I've just wrote the texts on the images in a paper and tomorrow I'll upload the edited images on the same document. I don't know if it's correct but i've signed "traducido por Imvec.tech". If not, simply erase ;) A question [@warren](/profile/warren): second page must  be translated or are just the guidelines for the past collective writing?

I've just translated one page of the Flight log. I'm not a google docs savy user. I can't erase the lines, just the content ;D
