The Raspberry Pi is housed in an aluminum enclosure, but the camera points out an airlock porthole on the International Space Station; I am unsure what material surrounds the airlock.

As the prevalence of snow and porthole material in the prior image may have lowered the NDVI values, I tried cropping another photo of Southern Italy and using the NDVI blue filter colorized preset, but not much of the land shows up. Should I be multiplying Red or Blue in the NDVI equation to enhance the appearance of land?
