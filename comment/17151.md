[@liz](/profile/liz) There is an issue posted which I am working on currently which would show the location according to the precision set, for example when you are zoomed out and precision is 0, the text box will only show the country name and as we zoom in the state, city, etc. will be displayed. Here's the link for the issue https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location/issues/63. Feel free to have a look :)
