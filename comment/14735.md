Holy cow, it works. I modified your SHT21_Logger.ino sketch to log data from two MCP9808 sensors and one DHT22 sensor and it seems to work great. It was logging fine every ten seconds, so I changed it to every 5 minutes, but I was too eager to get the probes back into the compost pile so I didn't wait around for five minutes to confirm. I might check on it tomorrow to make sure it is working.

Thanks for the new sketch,  
Chris
