Cool Gina!



You&#x27;d asked a few questions on the list about georectifying imagery that has previous aerial reference imagery .  Consider using [ground control points](/wiki/mapping-curriculum-ground-control-point-targets) on your next outing.



Some ground control point strategies:

You can print [coded ground control points](/notes/jasja/6-13-2012/coded-ground-control-points), so they can each be differentiated, although on the water paper targets might be a problem.



You can also try making coded ground control points with [long &quot;hotdog&quot; style balloons](/notes/cfastie/6-24-2012/alaska-range-balloon-mapping) used for making balloon animals.  I think this is the most fun option, and the most likely to work in a wetland.
