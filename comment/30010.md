Hi [@Akanbifatimah](/profile/Akanbifatimah), thank you for taking the time to look at Infragram and understand what the problems are. In your mockup, I noticed you added a nav item for FAQs. Do you plan on creating a new page for FAQs or leaving them on the same page? What do you think about converting the Q&A section to a Help menu instead?

How do you plan on implementing the cross-browser drag and drop functionality? Libraries you plan to use and code snippets would be very helpful.

Thank you!!
