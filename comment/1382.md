Do you mean point it at the sun, or just at the sky? If it's at the sun we'll need to use a diffuser or something, or it'll be way blown out. What do you think?

Here are a few sky/sun spectra, mostly sky i think:

So getting the right amount of exposure will be key. I should first add a readout so you can see what % of total possible light you're seeing currently with the spectrometer.
