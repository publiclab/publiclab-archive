I have been meaning to do a post about the Tangerine Rokkaku. I have yet to have a full KAP session with it so I hope that will happen soon. Here is some footage of it on its first flight three months ago.

I was really impressed that even in a stiff wind there was so little fluttering. That is one of the reasons it pulls so hard -- the wind's energy is not wasted flapping the kite sail around. Parafoil kites can be designed to be very quiet in the wind, but the squid kite is designed mostly to look really awesome. Hence my comment about looking for a simple delta for new mappers. Just the maintenance and launching difference between no bridle and an 18 line bridle is a strong argument, and there are others.

I made all the spars in three sections, so the sections are a little longer than two feet. So it is no harder to pack than my other sparred kites. Anyway, the priority should be lifting cameras, not travelling.
