Update on this: hardware testing is on hold while we ship these back to our fab to work on the procedure for flashing firmware on their end. We're trying to find the best way to have all this handled during production, so the things can ship directly from there, or at least not require any handling prior to shipping.

We should have flashed boards ready to test next week. Thanks for watching us sort this all out!
