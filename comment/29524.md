I am trying to build version 1.3.1 which seems to be the latest at https://github.com/martinber/noaa-apt/releases The cargo build step is failing with this error:

❯ cargo build --release
    Updating crates.io index
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `approx = "=0.5.0"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.4.0, 0.3.2, 0.3.1, ...
location searched: crates.io index
required by package `noaa-apt v1.3.1 (/.../noaa-apt-1.3.1)`

Thoughts about how to fix this?
