The connection doesn't matter, however a wireless connection will need some more attention during setup (you have to input the password to your router). A wired connection is easier and probably more reliable, but wifi has the advantage of being relatively location independent.

You obviously need a wifi usb stick, as wifi is not integrated into the raspberry pi. If you have one you can just follow the normal [installation instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/).
