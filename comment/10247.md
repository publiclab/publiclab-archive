Hi, Mat - I've noticed that olive oil fluorescence is much dimmer than crude oil fluorescence, and I shipped you some crude samples this morning. That'll help somewhat. See these two vials below, with the olive oil being the pinkish one:

But the SANM camera seems to be much less sensitive than the SYBA cam for some reason; look at these two scans: 

SANM: https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/33804

SYBA: https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/33797

Both uncalibrated, but here's the graph for intensity:

And for the SANM I cut the slit wider, too -- like 1.5mm! It's too bad. I wonder if it's just the SANM cam that's giving us trouble and that we don't necessarily need a *MUCH* better camera, just a different one.
