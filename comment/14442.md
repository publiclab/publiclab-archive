[@warren](/profile/warren), this is great. Thanks! I'm also interested in: 
(1) both in-line and post-text commenting (like how we comment on research notes). 
(2) being able to have linked sections that would be the same on multiple wiki pages (e.g. "background information" in the frac sand wiki could also be material on the Wisconsin wiki) where you could edit one and have it automatically edited in the other place. This is lower priority than other things on the list, but just wanted to mention it.
(3) Being able to call out people in in-line comments (e.g. "Hey [@warren](/profile/warren), can you edit this section?")
(4) Can we power-tag research notes to help streamline a single research project with many notes?
