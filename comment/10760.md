I've been using the Mobius Cam with both standard and Wide Angled Lens for KAP and soon UAV.  I solved the lens distortion issue thanks to a workflow suggested to me in the comment section of my KAP research note- (see bottom 3 comments in the thread) http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/06-25-2014/kap-test-for-invasives-monitoring-project 
  Basically, there is a Plugin called "BIMP" that allows you to do batch processing in GIMP.  You do need to set the distortion values manually however, by taking a screenshot and copying the values into the plugin dialog.
   There are other FOSS programs for batch processing like DIGIKAM and HUGIN Panorama editor that I havent tried yet.  However, considering the popularity of GIMP, it may be worth designing our own plugin with Mapknitter (and/or Infragram) support as more and more people use the Mobius Cam.
