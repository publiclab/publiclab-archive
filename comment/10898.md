I think it would be difficult to measure for heavy metals without interacting with the plant in some way, as the metals are unlikely to be hanging out on the surface of the plant.

Most likely you'd have to get a plant sample, pulverize it enough to rip apart the cell walls, and then run a spectrum of the plant guts in solution. There might be other methods, but I'm not thinking of anything that would work from far away with no ability to interact with the plant.
