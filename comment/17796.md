Hi, I was thinking that one thing that might really help to:

1. enable different testing approaches
2. make it easier to run a "standard" test in comparison to a low-cost technique

would be to build out some guidance on taking the samples -- the scanning, testing etc can then happen in a coordinated way a bit later. Would this be helpful to you? 

There are the beginning of some resources up at https://publiclab.org/wiki/sampling -- would this be for soil or water samples? 

One thing this could enable is simultaneous testing using an established lab method and a lower-cost method, which can help to prove out the lower-cost methods (or, as the case may be, show that they need work!).
