Thanks [@stevie](/profile/stevie) and [@warren](/profile/warren). So green is 140 degrees and represents 0 ug/m3 and red is zero degrees and >= 20 ug/m3? I'm curious about how the calibration was done by you.

It would be very cool if you could program the simple air sensor to reflect the EPA air quality index (AQI) using the following chart (from, https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=2ahUKEwjknY6R5pnkAhUkhOAKHR2_ClUQFjADegQIDRAG&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fsites%2Fproduction%2Ffiles%2F2016-04%2Fdocuments%2F2012_aqi_factsheet.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3korf91hVoSvvEiD4o2GKV):

I've also emailed Plantronics to see what dust standard they used ("Arizona road dust"), what their particle density conversion algorithm is, and if they assume Rayleigh and/or Mie scattering. No response.
