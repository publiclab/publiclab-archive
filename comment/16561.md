Forsure, thou, I wouldn't change the grating to a prism.
option 1 Holographic diffraction grating from Edmond optics pack of 15 <20$US
Option 2 Other options here: https://www.edmundoptics.com/optics/gratings/

As for cameras, the options are endless and there is definitely what to gain from using a good monochrome camera.
