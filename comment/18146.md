That's a tough one -- I think you could look around on http://leafletjs.com -- i'm sure it's been done -- and potentially modify Leaflet.DistortableImage with that code: https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/

Sorry it's not easier but it's not part of the featureset for MapKnitter, but it seems possible with some customization!
