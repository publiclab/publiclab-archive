EDIT: Did some further testing and it was an error on my end. Used the wrong module to colormap the pictures. Ill leave the rest of the comment though for future reference. 

Is the fastie colormap correctly implemented?

This is my original image taken with Raspberry PI NoIR camera with blue filter
[![testAWB.png](/i/29924)](/i/29924)

I have written my own application for processing images and applying the fastie colormap.
I get these results

[![ndvi_2019-3-7-15-11-21.png](/i/29925)](/i/29925)

With the imagesequencer tool from the same original image I posted at the top I get these results
[![colormap.png](/i/29926)](/i/29926)

To me it seems that the values have been inverted.

Otherwise very nice tool!
