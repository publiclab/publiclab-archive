Nice! can't wait to hear more.  makes me feel like i've been wasting my time measuring things.

Build questions:
-- is that yellow duct tape?
-- what are the spars made of? dowels?
-- do the wing's leading edge spars run all the way to the nose?
-- how is the spreader spar re-enforced?

Design/flight questions:
-- how did you pick the bridle point?
-- would it fly without the tail?
