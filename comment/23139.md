For what it is worth, I just dug out and hooked up my prototype of the Public Lab Spectrometer 3 and, without fiddling around, got exactly the same result you have - black screen. I don't remember what slit size I have in there, but with any of the relatively small slits and given the degree of collimation along the length of the spectrometer there is a lot of attenuation. You really have to get the thing lined up with the light source and use a bright light source to get an image (as well as adjust the camera settings). It took a high intensity LED torch right up against the slit to get an instant and obvious image.You might try using the widest slit, I think that is a 0.4mm, or just cut a wide slit in a piece of card until you get the thing working and get used to how to set it up.
