The description of the operating principle can be misleading.

Optical particle measurements rely on **intensity** of scattering rather than "amount of time that light is scattered"
The scientific name for that is ["Mie scattering"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering) and there have been many instruments over the years that leverage that process to estimate the mass of particles in a volume of air [see here for the TSI DusTrak measurement principle](http://www.tsi.com/uploadedFiles/_Site_Root/Products/Literature/Application_Notes/ITI-036.pdf) that is the older version of the "research grade" optical particle monitor (for particle mass!)
The newer version of the DusTrak use "single pulse analysis" to gain insights on how many particles are there and mixing BOTH data (intensity of scattering and number of particles) the newer instruments estimate size distributions [see here for details](http://www.tsi.com/uploadedFiles/_Site_Root/Products/Literature/Application_Notes/EXPMN-002_DustTrak_DRX_Theory_of_Operation.pdf)

I wasn't sure about editing the page itself or how to start a discussion about this topic. Happy to move this discussion to the "talk" part and then edit the main text once we've agreed on it.
