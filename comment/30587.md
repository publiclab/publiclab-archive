Tilapia fish are a resource of protein for catfish. In the winter, that’s when tilapia fish are needed more for catfish because there are trying to build their egg supply up. Tilapia fish like to multiple quickly in the summer so the number of species should stay balanced. The catfish is benefiting from the tilapia, although the catfish isn’t a natural predator to tilapia fish, and they aren’t naturally searching for tilapia fish as protein. However, putting the two fish together can be harmful. In one article, it states that tilapia fish are bony and can harm smaller fish like the catfish. The relationship between the tilapia fish and the catfish is mutualism. In the article “Catfish, tilapia and grass carp environment-friendly”, Thompson fed the tilapia to the catfish. This relationship can be considered as parasitism because after all, the tilapia fish does die. To contradict the last statement, the catfish doesn’t latch onto the tilapia fish.
