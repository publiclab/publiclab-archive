Hi, [@ryzokuken](/profile/ryzokuken) - just getting back in here now; just for starters, can you update the Cases above with a brief mention of

1. where the bot would appear (chatroom, comments, GitHub PR etc)
2. link to the "feed" or listing of where these show up, such as https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pulls or https://chat.publiclab.org
3. what new APIs (if any) we'd need to read AND write to that feed?

This'll help us choose the very first, and understand some of the initial steps we'd have to take to do an initial test implementation. For example, i see you mention the JSON API in the first month, and the PublicLab.org microservice in the second. But I wasn't sure -- are you saying you'd set up a chatroom-based test case first to try things out, or do you think the PublicLab.org commenting API could be the initial test (since most community newcomers start there -- say, in a Question, and not in the chatroom).

I could see either being advantageous, because it'd be great to meet newcomers where they are first, but it could also be great to use the chatroom as a more flexible testing space before starting the extra integration with PublicLab.org and the challenge of working well with newcomers. What do you think, and [@stevie](/profile/stevie) and [@ananyo2012](/profile/ananyo2012), what are your thoughts?

Thanks!
