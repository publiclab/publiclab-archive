Hi, Dave - I believe I was able to apply the correction by running the following line in the new Scripting tab:

    SpectralWorkbench.API.Core.useReference(false, spectrum); graph.reload_and_refresh();

This used your non-rolled-off correction file. I'm not sure yet how I want to integrate this into the Operations system, but I was able to download a CSV output using this and the JavaScript console: 

    SpectralWorkbench.API.Core.useReference(false, spectrum, function() { spectrum.average.forEach(function(line) { console.log(line.x + ',' + line.y)})});

The output was: 

<a href="//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/014/276/original/spectralwb-71409.csv"><i class="icon icon-file"></i> spectralwb-71409.csv</a>

And it looked like this:
