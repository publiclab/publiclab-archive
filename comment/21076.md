Hi [@joyofsoy](/profile/joyofsoy), 

thank you very much for your feedback :) 

For the About Us and Donate, you are right, that will come on top in the navigation bar.

Regarding the community science bit at the bottom, it should align perfectly when viewing it on the laptop (this is how I see it: https://www.evernote.com/l/AEHMv8aIWx9GtZtbQpNcD07DCqhM8zFCdAw). When the screen is resized (to smaller), it will start collapsing. At what screen size are you viewing it? Can you share your screenshot as well?

Regarding the carousel, [@warren](/profile/warren) do I just go with a plain bootstrap one with controls? Would someone be able to provide the text for each tag? 

Thank you to both! 

Kind regards, 
Eva
