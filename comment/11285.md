I've just looked at the Solux lamps. As far as I can see they are halogen lamps with built in blue filters. What a great find.

I've tried daylight incandescent lamps before, but this was a while ago. The lamps I tried were ordinary tungsten bulbs with a blue filter (I have been meaning to try producing some plots for them with the PL spec.) I hadn't realised you could get daylight corrected lamps in halogen. I'll have to get some. 

BTW you can also get lighting filters for daylight correction of tungsten filament lamps farily cheaply from Lee filters. Although I guess the Solux with the filtering built in are more convenient. I wonder how much different variation in the supply voltage makes to the lamp spectrum. Lab reference lamps do have regulated power supplies.
