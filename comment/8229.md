The Fiji plugin doesn't subtract anything, it just assumes you have a visible channel and a NIR channel. Once you remove the IR block filter, there is going to be some NIR light in all three channels. Ned was talking about ways to subtract out the NIR from a channel, but I don't understand how that would be possible.
