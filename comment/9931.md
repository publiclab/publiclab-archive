p56 mentions "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, environmental hormones" as contaminants that can be detected with fluorescence spectroscopy in water. Great quote on the cost-effectiveness and speed of this technique: 

> The standard techniques for pesticides and PAHs detection are gas and
liquid chromatography, which require tedious extraction or separations procedures and
expensive equipments. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a rapid and cost effective alternative,
since PAHs and many pesticides are naturally fluorescent (Jiji et al., 1999). When dealing
with more components, the use of SFS or EEM techniques is recommended.
