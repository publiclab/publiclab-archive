Hello [@JacobMatz](/profile/JacobMatz), 
In searching for air quality sensors it seems most of them are intended for indoor use. The Specks looks interesting. Have you tested them outdoors? Things I've dealt with include high heat, high humidity, and insects like wasps and spiders liking to attach to the enclosures. I'd be glad to work with you on a test if you're interested.
