also, right now this is, like my earlier stopper example, a sealant strategy without sensors to go with it. 

[@Donblair](/profile/Donblair) has stuck to his guns on screws-through-the-cap conductivity sensor designs as the most accessible to assemble. We sourced some 0-80 machine screws and o-rings that should work better than previous through-the-cap screw designs.  I believe [@Donblair](/profile/Donblair) put some out in the field or is working on those.  

I'll be bringing silicone and stoppers to the barnraising, we can play with both strategies and some sensor prototype ideas for stoppers. My impression is that we want a 1.0 riffle kit to focus on screws-through-the-cap system.
