I'll still researching. Based on what I found I'm probably better off getting a lux meter for brightness, and maybe the spectrometer for color spectrum. I'm just not sure if the light source (bulb) will be too bright for the spectrometer. Thinking I can probably move the source further away from the spectrometer to reduce brightness (in an box isolated from ambient light)
