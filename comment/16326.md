Finding inexpensive, do-it-yourself calibration targets is an obstacle to NDVI calibration. You need targets for which the spectral reflectance is known for the wavelengths you capture and use for the NIR and VIS bands. Ideally these targets would have the SAME reflectance for ALL wavelengths, but that usually requires commercial targets like these:

You can use common materials with published spectral response, but these don't have the same response for all wavelengths, so you have to know the exact wavelengths you are capturing. Below are some sources of spectral data for common materials:  
http://speclab.cr.usgs.gov/spectral-lib.html, http://speclib.jpl.nasa.gov/  http://spectrallibrary.utep.edu/, http://www.frames.gov/partner-sites/assessing-burn-severity/spectral/  

You can use a spectrometer to describe the response of any material as Ned did here:
