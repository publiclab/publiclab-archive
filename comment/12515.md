[@DavidMack](/profile/DavidMack) a silicone stopper would be great! they're better in cold temperatures than natural rubber. It also seems like it would bond better with a silicone glue, though I'm not sure. The stopper will be of a [catalyst silicone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTV_silicone), while the caulk is a different polymer in a solvent of some sort. 

[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) Slippage is not an issue with the cap on, and if a [#3](/n/3) stopper is used.

A sufficiently elastic stopper is needed to form a good seal in the bottle. The natural rubber stopper I used works great. The silicone stopper will be similarly elastic to the natural rubber stopper.  I have some vulcanized rubber stoppers, which would have similar weather resistance to the silicone ones but they are too hard to squeeze in. Those stoppers would certainly not make as good a seal. 

As for the bottle being a good housing, PET is tough, and a tough material to bond to, so it fouls slowly in water. Same for the HDPE of the cap. My biggest worry would be the cap getting cold and shattering.  Rice resists compression, reduces boyancy, and provides an both an ample desiccant and some thermal mass to protect the electronics against rapid temperature change:

The alternative would be building a custom housing that will never be particularly cheap in the runs any of us are going to do. If I were going to do it, I'd probably do something similar to the awesome work that [Edward Mallon](https://edwardmallon.wordpress.com/2015/02/04/a-new-diy-underwater-housing-for-2015/) is doing. Those things could probably go through a boat propeller and keep logging.  These are hardened data capsules that could go years. 

But they aren't without their drawbacks. 

none of the parts can be made with the exacting equipment needed for low surface energy materials like PET and PE, unless you are milling them from blocks.  Most of the parts in small production run will be more easily bonded materials like metals, PVC, acrylic, nylon.  Edward is encountering the [fouling trouble inherent in these material choices](https://edwardmallon.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/field-report-2015-08-17-flow-sensors-go-back-into-akumal-bay/). I need a Rfle to stick in a bottle! I'll eat my words if it comes out with barnacles in a few months.
