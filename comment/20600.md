[@xuhulk](/profile/xuhulk) awesome! Bedstuy and LES are 2 likely hotspots for lead.
You can sign up to be a tester at https://www.citizenspring.org/
Corlears Hook Park and Loeb Playground in LES are particularly old playgrounds for which I haven't yet found any record of drinking fountain renovation, which increases the likelihood that lead pipes, lead solder, and/or lead fixtures are in use.
If you can think of any specific communities we should reach out to, like science classrooms or mom's groups or running groups, it'd be great if we could test a bunch of fountains before they go off for the winter. You can email me directly via sean [at] citizen spring [dot] org
Cheers, Sean
