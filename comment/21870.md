 You might be able to find some thing.  Let's take it step by step. 
First, the only one of those metals that has any color in the Vis is chromium.  Even then, you will probably need to get it to the same oxidation state.  Cr(3) and Cr (6) absorb at different wavelengths. It might still be better to go with a cheating agent, even with chromium.
The public labs spectrometer is visible only.  That's not to say you couldn't extent the range.  But it will take some extra money to do.  For exsmple, the lamps commonly used are deuterium lamps, which are quite expensive.  Having said that, there was an article on public labs about using tesla coils as a plasma source for other ga s lamps.  That might be a way to generate a source of uv light.  
Now, as to the astro stuff.  The common methods on earth are atomic absorption(AA), graphite furnace AA, or a variation on inductively coupled plasma (ICP).  These are usually ICP mass spec or ICP optical emission. These are abbreviated ICP/MS and ICP/OES.  They are quite expensive.  But, prior to the fourier transform revolution, most instruments were. Now, FTIR instruments have dramatically reduced the cost of those instruments.  Anything I can do to help, let me know.
