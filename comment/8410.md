Hi Chris,

Amazing. Thank you for detailing out what can be done. So, as far as I can understand, instead of finding our 2 peaks (which always makes the calibration a linear one), we now need to find one more (the big red line at 611nm).

Now, we will have 3 peaks with us. We can use these to calibrate the spectrum with some non-linear calibration (mostly a 2nd order polynomial as we have only 3 peaks). The higher the number of peaks we consider, higher would be the order of this polynomial.

Also, could you throw some light on few must-have features for offline SWB? I am planning for a stable release and it would be better if we included some really required features in both online and offline SWB.
