Hi azaelb,

I was not able to get very meaningful NDVI images from a Mobius ActionCam key chain camera modified with a blue filter. A red filter worked much better. I don't know why, but small CMOS sensors do not seem to work well with blue filters. Red filters worked so well that I never tried blue filters again. My results are summarized here: [http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-26-2014/mobius-ndvi](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-26-2014/mobius-ndvi).  It would be interesting to try a [yellow filter](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/01-16-2015/orange-is-the-new-red). It's also important to set the white balance properly on the Mobius camera. It seems to be a serious disadvantage for single camera NDVI if you cannot set a custom white balance.
