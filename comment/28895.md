[@WendyBrawer](/profile/WendyBrawer) [@LESBreathe](/profile/LESBreathe) This flyer is incredible! ❤️ Thanks so much for sharing! As another way to get it on a screen, would you be interested in giving this guide its own research note with the same text and image you've shared here? Others could build onto it or add translations. I'd be happy to support posting, just let me know!
