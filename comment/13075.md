the other context for that nutty housing with zip ties was for aerial use. if we flew a riffle, with the protection of the bottle/ties harness, it could take a hit and keep on riffing.
I know we are talking with some folks about aerial data logging for educational use, such as logging temp or humidity at height, or potentially wind speed.
