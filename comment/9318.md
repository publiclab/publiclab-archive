Hi,

Great project.

I do multi rotors, rc planes, blimp and kite pics.

Your pictures will be 100 times better with a Mobius, plus a waterproof case. 
100 dollars, intervalometer inside, quite shockproof.

You will need Gimp and bimp to automatically make the pics square, and you can use agisoft photoscan for composing the whole picture.

Best of all, you can even make 3D images of your same project, from the exact same software and hardware, like I do here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOmtm0G-AJQ

Cheers
