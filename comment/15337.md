Oops, my comment is poorly formatted, (can't re-edit but filed an issue) -- but you get the idea. I don't know of a moving body of water near LEAFFEST, but we could try a really basic timelapse of, say, the camping area? 

There are some creeks, but they're very dark and shaded, and I don't think you'd see much change. [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie), what do you think? 

I'd found this one on the thread I mentioned in my last comment: 	

> Yeah - i saw that trail or hunting cameras have come down in price and gone up in quality a /lot/ since we tried them out in ~2011 (Hunter Daniel and I were hoping to do a timelapse of actual wetlands loss by running one for 6 months on solar power, kind of like that glacier timelapse project). They're now available at 12 megapixel resolution for under $100: https://www.amazon.com/Crenova-Hunting-Infrared-Scouting-Surveillance/dp/B00LHB4IKY/
