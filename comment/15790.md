Hi kaushalsingh – The three target reflectance values you  note seem like a good choice to me. At this point I do not have study material in addition to the research notes on this website (there are several) and the user guide for the photomonitoring plugin (https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin).

I typically use linear regression to calculate the relationship between reflectance (dependent variable, y) and pixel value (independent variable, x). The result of the linear regression will give you the slope (gain) and intercept (offset) of the line fitting the reflectance and pixels values from the sample points from your reference targets. The formula for a line is y = mx + b where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. In your case you want to calculate (predict) reflectance (y) using the image pixel value (x).
