[@amirberAgain](/profile/amirberAgain) I have come up with a system for our JS project to achieve basic particle detection, this is my first attempt, please provide your review

- First we apply edge-detect to the image to binarize it, We can have a foreground pixel and background pixel associated with the output(Since we decided that image can be on black background as well)

- We can then apply connected component labelling on the edge-detected image(I'll write a new module for this which will take in foreground pixel values and background pixel values and a binary image)

- We can then count the number of pixels in each of the components and that will give us the perimeter in pixels

- For area I have devised a method (but it will not be exact if particles are concave), we can run that for each component and it'll fill each component and then again we can count the number of foreground pixels in each component and get the area in pixels^2 (squared)

- Area and perimeter can be converted using a given scale to actual dimensions.

Algorithm:
