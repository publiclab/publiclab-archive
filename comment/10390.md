[@warren](/profile/warren) The line that you describe would be the weighted mean of the dataset (integral divided by two, aka area under the curve divided by two as [@mathew](/profile/mathew) noted). This would be super easy to find assuming the plot was a histogram. Unfortunately the data plotted from the frequncy vs amplitude is not a histogram as such, because we don't have those little balls used to create the histogram curve. We only have the one curve itself. So we have to integrate the whole thing, find what half the integral is, and then find /where/ half the integral occurs.

You might also be talking about linear discriminant analysis if the left side balls are quantitatively different from the right side balls. LDA is a clustering algorithm to separate classes of data. Again, since we don't have access to the balls, this is probably irrelevant.
