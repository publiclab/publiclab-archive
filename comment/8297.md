Thanks Grayson,

I was referring to stretching the histograms in the Fiji plugin. I forget what the default is, but it can make a big difference.

GIMP might allow you to marquee an area of grass in your current photos and see the histogram for just that area.

If the aquatic algae is floating it should be revealed by NDVI. If it is near the surface, and there is a lot of it, it might show up. I'm not sure how deep you can see into water and get similar results in both an NIR and visible image so that you can compute NDVI. If the algae is blue-green algae you will need to out-think it. Some common blue-green algae absorb light only at the red end of the spectrum. So there should be a difference in NDVI depending on whether you use the red or blue channel for visible light. Demonstrating that difference could confirm that the signal is from blue-green algae.
