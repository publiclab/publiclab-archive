I had posted the .ai file I used to cut, and I've just uploaded the original .svg, as I am not able to open that .ai (check the research note https://publiclab.org/notes/pablo/11-09-2016/how-to-do-upgrade-desktop-spectrometer-kit-2-0-to-the-version-3-0?_=1487194384). They are just the the same original vectors but removed some duplicated paths from the original file in the spectrometer repository.
I just made a test and I think it does fit in 15x15 inches: <a href="https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/019/568/original/lasercut-ponoko-pablo-15x15.svg"><i class="fa fa-file"></i> lasercut-ponoko-pablo-15x15.svg</a>

Regarding scores: I think it is a question of the power of the laser (or whatever indicator used to limit the strength of the cut) and the cardboard. Tuni, the guy who laser cut it for me, knew the power for that particular type of cardboard. Reinforcing it with tape I guess is another good way to go.
