 The main cost for for a FIA or SIA would be a peristaltic pump and a flow cell - I've built my own a couple of times.  You could make a flow cell or buy one depending on how you are orienting/attaching the detector.  You also could likely come up with a way to do the project as sequential injection using a series of syringes and multiport LC fittings.  

For the cadmium column, you just put the cadmium into a tube and flow the solution through it for reduction.  You just have to have the flow rate and size of the tube set up sufficiently to allow total reduction.
