Great, thanks -- and just to link to the question I'd asked about this earlier: https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/09-28-2016/upgrade-a-diy-spectrometer-with-a-raspberry-pi-camera (i'd also linked to a possible approach there to the interface question -- a good one)

Also -- any thoughts on sensitivity as measured here? https://publiclab.org/notes/khufkens/11-02-2015/ov5647-raspberry-pi-camera-spectral-response-quantum-efficiency

Thanks!
