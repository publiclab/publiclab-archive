Actually I use Adobe Photoshop Lightroom which is very similar to RawTherapee, and he have 5 types of output format. 
JPEG,PSD (Photoshop format),TIFF,DNG and ORIGINAL (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format).
So,with Adobe photoshop ligthroom you can use the CHDK DNG as well as the CHDK RAW and that means you can do these CHDK RAW conversions.
