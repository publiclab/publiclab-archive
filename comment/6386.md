Chris - fantastic work! Thanks for your labor and good thinking on this.
My theory on the offset is that the GPS' could have been using different datum settings. Do you know the datum used in your device? I'll ask Nate what the datum was set to for the Trimble device. My hunch is it will have been NAD83. Could yours be WGS84?
