Jeff, 
If you include the dimensions of the part of the spectrometer that inserts into the window, and the dimensions of the cuvettes, the next mockup could be closer to a usable reality. If LEDs will be the only thing requiring power, are coin cells sufficient, or will you need that AA battery? Will you have to block one cuvette window to take a reading from the other? Is a little sliding door required for that?
