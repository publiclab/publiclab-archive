Hello MaggPi,

Hopefully you or someone else can help. Is the purpose of two LEDs to have one for transmission(below sample) and another for reflection(above sample)?  I was thinking of using these 5mm LED from LED supply (850nm & 940nm) on a credit card substrate with copper tape and button cell.

Could you recommend resistor pot for dimmer control, or should I use their 20mA DynaOhm?  I am wondering what's the best configuration to allow ease of exchange between wavelengths, as I was also considering using 365m, and 400nm wavelength LED (safety first).

Thanks for the feedback
