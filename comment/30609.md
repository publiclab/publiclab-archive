Restoring Louisiana lost coast, marsh land and barrier island can cause an ecological succession. The fresh water from the river with sediments will be flush out to the gulf to restore the barrier island. This can cause an allogenic succession where saltwater fish will be replaced with freshwater fish species. The barrier island play’s a crucial role for the safety of Louisiana from hurricanes but restoring these barrier islands can have a negative impact on the fishing industries. In conclusion the disruption of such ecosystem for the cause of restoration weighs a heavy price of consequences and decisions that are up to whether the benefits far outweigh the cost of such restoration.
