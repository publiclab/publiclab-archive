Unfortunately, LED wavelength does not change with applied voltage or current -- their center peak wavelength is not variable or controllable and PWM only controls intensity. Any correlation between observed Vf (forward voltage drop) and peak center wavelength is purely manufacturing variation.

That manufacturing variation results in different center peak wavelength as a result of bandgap variations in the semiconductor material; once constructed, it doesn't change. Also, the Vf forward voltage drop can be different between devices of the same product; same reason. The only two spectral changes are 1) a very slight aging at a rate of about 0.0001nm/hr of on-time and 2) with some devices, an increase in the FWHM (bandwidth) as current increases from the initial threshold voltage point to primary conduction with 20mA or more. With UV LEDs this later effect seems to be primarily a spread of the LED spectrum slope on the longer-wavelength-side, with little on the shorter wavelength side. However, once the current is set (fixed) even this effect does not change.
