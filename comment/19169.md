Hi [@namangupta](/profile/namangupta) ! 

This is really creative thinking especially **reply by twitter** feature . 

I have some experience with webhooks and a couple of things to add here : 

1.) If you plan to use Webhooks than why not then create a webhook to post tweets real-time , instead of using IFTTT ? Does this makes sense ?

2.) PublicLab has all the URL's and API's open , i.e anyone can access them . The URL used for Webhook provided by PublicLab will be open , right ?  

  * For a **big organization like PublicLab** , do you think it would be a safe option ? Especially what if someone gains access to this URL and sends TB's of data here , which will result in spam data and ultimately server crashes . Our website will be flooded with bad data in this case .

  *  This may be a extreme case but just trying to be **cautious** here ! You may be aware of the recent **DDoS attack on Github** , where TB's of data was transmitted (it is the biggest attack till date) . 

3.) I remember that it took me like atleast 2-3 weeks to get my account active for Webhooks . Is the approval time decreased now ?

4.) If in production , there is any error in our application, then the tweets that will be posted in that timeframe will be lost till the error is resolved (bcoz the twitter webhook will not pay attention) , makes sense ? 

5.) How to you plan to debug ? 

6.) The key (generated by IFTTT) comes **after** the tweet gets published . right ? So how will you add Key vs Node entry in database ?

7.) And you may have answer to this but just to add here - how do you plan on getting replies of a tweet as Twitter API does not directly give this directly ? 

**The *Email* part looks perfect to me and I learnt a lot :) Thanks !**

 I hope this helps ! 

Thanks so much :)
