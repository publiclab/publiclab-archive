Hola
I just see this post. 
[@alejobonifacio](/profile/alejobonifacio)  it is really interesting what you are doing with the appear!! 
We are now playing with openflexure microscope with the idea to monitor [soils to check biodiversity](https://www.flickr.com/photos/193163840@N03/with/51224942021/) We used some water test kits to [monitor nitrates](https://gitlab.com/nanocastro/ColorLabFD/-/tree/master/Test%20nitratos) and we did some test also in water
I think your work has much overlapping with the one of [Co-Sensores](https://tap.bio/@cosensores) 
I think it would be a good idea if we can talk and then maybe you can join us at reGOSH too. 
Let me know what you think
Saludos
