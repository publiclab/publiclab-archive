[@stoft](/profile/stoft) I apologize if you thought I was using ad hominem attacks, it was not meant to be so. I can read very well dave, the same might be said about my postings also, research or other wise,  case in point, my quote "As you can see by the data, I am within 9nm [525nm] of the target of 516nm for the spectral data taken by the Oregon Medical Laser center for Fluorescein in Ethanol."

You quoted me as saying "9nm is really not THAT far off...") 

Show me were I ever said that? Things like this are certainly an aspect of "critical" thinking right? I would hope that my words are begin read correctly also, in this way there will be no misunderstandings. I appreciate the fact that your resources are limited and that you do take the time to respond, but I do have the right to address the issues about how your approach to my research is sometimes unwarranted in it's tone.

I call it the XYZ principle: 
x= tell the person what the problem is
y= explain how you feel about it
z= tell the person what you expect 

This is the most up front and honest way to eliminate most misunderstandings.
