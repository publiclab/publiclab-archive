Yeah I want to point out that
1 )A user is having different emails for different providers. So, that way the new user will sign up via different accounts and then he will have different accounts at PL. We will not have any way to merge the information of the different accounts. That will be a big mess. When the user would sign up through different providers, he will expect the same content.

2)Consider the case when a user has an account with email address X on public lab traditionally and now he signs up through twitter with email Y(because he has given email Y to twitter).and then through facebook with email Y(because he has given email Y to Facebook)  So he will have two accounts 

Making of the duplicate accounts is something which we need to deal, I guess so not giving the user the ability to directly sign up through the providers without registering would be the best. He can link/unlink his different providers from his user account would be best. This will result in the effective creation of accounts and minimum need to merge accounts. The above points are trivial we do by this approach.

What do you suggest [@warren](/profile/warren)?
