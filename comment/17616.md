Well done, Jackie! It sounds like things are headed towards a just resolution, no? That's what I gather from "that UB would have to find away around their policy to include me." Another front you could open, should you need to is about the intellectual property of the grant, as you wrote it! saying that they are infringing on your intellectual property may be a way of appealing to a set of rules that is external to the university, although having them change their policy and share the already collected data seems optimal in some ways. There might not be need to throw extra fuel on the fire if DOJ is already dictating that they need to include data sharing with your org. Thanks for your work and determination!
