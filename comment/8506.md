Hi, Pascal - this seems like a great project. Please check out some of the thoughts on digitization of images from my comment on Sreyanth's proposal; whether sample row selection is achieved through image processing or by plotting a cross section line through the image, the method of getting from the raw image to the processed image should be stored and reproducible; we've been calling these "recipes". http://publiclab.org/notes/Sreyanth/03-04-2014/automatic-spectrometer-calibration-and-offline-swb-gsoc-2014-proposal#c8490

Sreyanth is worried that there is too much overlap in proposals, and I'm going to encourage both of you to widen your scope to make your proposals unique but helpful counterparts. 

There's plenty of work to be done in SWB! My initial thought is that your interest is in exposure, clipping, and sample row selection, whereas Sreyanth is interested in calibration. Perhaps if each of you affords the other space and coordinates where your code "touches", this can work... if you each take on another sub-project as well, we can get an awful lot done this summer!
