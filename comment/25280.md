Yes, so [here](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/caching-files-with-service-worker#serving_files_from_the_cache) is some documentation regarding Network with Cache fallback policy.

Actually, by looking at the service worker file, it doesn't look like image sequencer is following this policy...in fact, it follows `cache with network fallback policy`. You can take a look [here](https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/blob/main/examples/sw.js#L27). This means that whenever the requested resource is available in the cache, IS shows that cached response and if not successful, falls back on the traditional network call.

Moreover, here's a illustration that shows network with cache fallback policy clearly,

However, community-toolbox implements constant cache updation on top of that, so that the cache is guaranteed to have the most recent copy of data.
