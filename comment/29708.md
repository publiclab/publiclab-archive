I learned that most testing are intended to microplastics. They should be able to study into it more to be able to focus on how much it affects our environment.  I learned about the traditional plastics and nontraditional plastics. Traditional plastics would be polystyrene and polypropylene. Nontraditional plastics would be synthetic rubber and silicone. Scientist can't evaluate nano plastics they need more advanced technologies to be able to test the chemicals. Nano plastics should be more looked over so they don't affect our environment in the future.
