Looks like a good starting point. For the moment, I'd first suggest incorporating some form of sub-topic list for the 'Body/Content' section which might have a different set for each general category. By this I mean that the selector for note/question/event/etc would each prompt an appropriate set of sub-sections in the body to be covered. A research note would require a different set than an announcement of an event. I acknowledge the existing Note format includes a few suggested questions to answer, but at least in the case of research, that list is insufficient and authors appear to need more guidance. Other types of submissions can have parallel missing material.
