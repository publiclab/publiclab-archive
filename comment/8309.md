Scott encouraged me to put up a research note on this, but considering the fine job he has already done, I offer a few comments:
- Scott put together a nice map from challenging conditions
- always have everything in order before going out into the field.  I did not.
- swivel controversy: the question is, can/does a swivel between kite and string reduce spinning or other erratic kite movements? It is my understanding that a swivel facilitates spinning.  At a very minimum, what a swivel does is allow something on one side of it to spin freely without affecting what is on the other side of it.  Regardless, I still think it is a good idea to put a swivel on the kite line.
- one camera perished that day (the kite couldn't resist taking a swim). may the electronics gods guide him to a nice spot in a landfill.
- I almost forgot: BIG lesson learned: it is probably never a bad idea to first put your kite or balloon up in the air before attaching the rig + camera.  I will try to remember this in the future.
- the area mapped, at the northeast end of Grand Isle, is a very dynamic environment and could serve as a site for repeated mapping to show great or rapid change over time.
