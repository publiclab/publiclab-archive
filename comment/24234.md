 Hi Stevie, Thanks so much for carrying out these tests. The results seem logical given the particle sizes of the solids you tested (e.g., sugar crystals much larger than cocoa powder) and noting that the sensor is looking for the "fine" PM2.5 particle size range.

We've now used the color-sensor to show audiences the differences between "whole" sand (all particle sizes) and refined "frac" sand (just the larger sizes): the former readily changes the color from green to red (when the power bar is charged) whereas the latter does not.

One fun demonstration we've done is to use cocoa powder which turns the sensor red and can be smelled but not seen by nearby audience members. This demonstrates the need for these kinds of monitors around frac sand mines since particulate emissions can't be seen but can be inhaled.
