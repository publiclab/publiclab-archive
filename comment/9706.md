For example, one of the differences, as noted in the comment posted in http://publiclab.org/notes/WhiteRabbit/07-27-2014/question-can-i-use-the-desktop-spectrometer-to-analyze-ordinary-reflected-light , is that the PL plot https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/14251 for greengrass02 looks a lot different than the plot referenced above, and it's a large difference.  I don't know whether it's because the lawn samples were different or because the PL Desktop Spectrometer would have produced that same curve even if it had sampled the same patch of lawn from the sample position and at the same time as whatever spectrometer produced the reference reflectance curve. For the reasons given above I'd like to know whether it would have produced the same curve if it had sampled the same thing from the same position at the same time.  I don't have the experience and the data to answer that question that you all presumably have.  If you haven't already done the comparison, sooner or later you'll either want to or need to.  Has such a comparison been done yet?
