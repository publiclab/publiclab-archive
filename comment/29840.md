Microplastics in the Great Lakes

The great Lakes make up the largest freshwater system on Earth. Recent studies have discovered the abundance of microplastic pollution. Of the 75% of Earth's surface that is made up of water, only about 3 percent of it is freshwater. We know now that the largest freshwater system is contaminated. This should be concerning because the great lakes: Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario are all major water sources for humans. The video we watched today on microplastics was the first we have seen where a scientist has tried to influence viewers and encourage them toward a solution. Sherri said that the reduction of the use of plastics one item at a time will help us to prevent further pollution at such an exponential rate.
