[@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2) I agree, the ambient network can be a little scarce in Philly, we have six PM 2.5 monitors measuring at different intervals. [Here's](https://www.phila.gov/health/pdfs/airmanagement/2018-19%20AMNP%20Final%20Draft%204.26.18.pdf) some more information about the ambient air monitoring network plan, and [here's](https://www.phila.gov/aqi/realtime.aspx) the link to real-time values collected at each station by AMS (the local regulatory agency). When you click a station on the map it should give you a real-time value for each pollutant measured there. 

I'm heading up some of Clean Air Council's air monitoring work in Philly, so we have some open PurpleAirs already deployed [here](https://www.purpleair.com/map?457811%7C457813#11.87/39.96974/-75.16076). We're focusing on community monitoring in the Kensington (19134) area targeting local sources like scrapyards and construction. We've also given one to AMS to collocate with one of their regulatory sensors (this one is set to private currently). I'll see if I can draw up a more in-depth research note at some point about what we're doing in the area.
