Hi [@radz_saini99](/profile/radz_saini99), it looks like the design you posted as a solution belongs to another applicant. Please read our guidelines about borrowing ideas:

>If you are building on the ideas that inspired you from another proposal, you MUST attribute them by name with a link to the original so that credit is given. Copying verbatim from another proposal is not allowed, but if you credit where an idea came from you can add to that idea in your own proposal. I'd like to ask that you do this only if you are building further upon the idea, not just adopting the idea as it is.
