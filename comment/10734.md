Hi [@ives](/profile/ives), the GPS Test app is even better! Thanks for the tip. 

Unfortunately though, the SkyCam app is not working well on my phone. It does not send emails or even display an error message like in your screenshot. It also is only saves one image to the SD Card every session (the last image, right before I click Stop Timer)
