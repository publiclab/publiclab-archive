Hi, thanks for posting! One thing I've wondered about is whether different exposures -- that are not clipping/overexposed but are different overall heights -- would height-adjust to match again. That is, if you take 4 spectra, at (for example) 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% max height, and you add them to a set and height adjust them to equalize their max heights, would they have the same curve shape? I'd love to see a test like that.
