The EPA has created a comprehensive database for physical, chemical, and toxicological data for hundreds of thousands of chemicals: https://comptox.epa.gov. 

You can click on the "Chemical Properties" tab to learn about things like whether a chemical is hydrophobic or hydrophilic, if it's volatile, etc. 
You can click on the "Env. Fate/Transport" to learn about things like how reactive it is in the atmosphere, whether or not it's likely to be metabolized, whether or not it bioaccumulates, etc. 
It includes exposure guidelines under "Hazard" and common products that contain it (and are an exposure pathway) under "Exposure." 

Check it out! https://comptox.epa.gov.  I'm hoping to create some user guides to make it more accessible to folks without a chemistry background to understand what the categories of data mean -- is anyone interested in collaborating on this??
