Sorry Chris, where are you getting the  dialog box for processing VIS/NIR image pairs into NDVI and NRG menu from ? ( the second screen that you show me )
When i go to Plugins, PhotoMonitoringPluginMaster/src/ y have 4 options
List images
Register Images
Create NDVI from image
Create NDVI from Dir...

already save the lut file, now is listed
