While one could construct two, parallel slits, no, that would not 'enhance resolution. A single slit is many, many wavelengths 'wide'. Assuming ideally-parallel light, the slit controls the number of diffraction grading ('DVD lines') being illuminated. Narrower single slits with very sharp edges are better. Wider/multiple slits and 'fuzzy' edges only add optical interference pattern distortion. As slit width decreases so does the total light intensity so with simple 'webcam' detectors, there are diminishing returns. For PLab-type devices, slit widths in the range of 0.1-0.15mm experimentally appears to be a good trade-off. PLab 'photo-film-slits' have limited edge-sharpness and their 'slit-space' has some random film emulsion spotting -- not dramatic but a pair of razor blades is experimentally, more optimal (if you can construct one accurately). https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/10-03-2016/plab-3-proto-slit-upgrade  might be helpful.
