I just reviewed this conversation and would like to add to it and would like comments from [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) and [@guolivar](/profile/guolivar) if possible.  About the USEPA AQI:  if you look again at the table and formula [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) posted above you will notice the column for pm2.5 refers to a 24 hr average. If the point is to inform about the current air quality someone might breath in, a 24 hour average based upon the past 24 hours is not useful.Particulate in the past is not what will enter your breathing now. The pm2.5 standard is based upon a 24 hour average and to keep within the context of the standards, against which all the "health" research has been based, the EPA AQI uses an average of the past 12 hours with an estimation (prediction) of the next 12 hours to assess the air NOW. If you are not able to do that prediction part, you will be misappropriating the risk (health) aspect of the formula and possibly misinforming those you want to communicate with. If you are not able to do the prediction part I maintain you should provide information stating you are using a modified and unassessed version of the USEPA AQI. My suspicion is that PurpleAir does not do this prediction part and, as many people do, takes the most current reading or average over a short period of time, and plugs it into the formula in place of the correct 24 hour past and future average. 
Whether you use the AQI or particulate density this addresses the color you use and its risk assessment (or actually misappropriation of risk assessment!)
