Hi [@mathildaudufo](/profile/mathildaudufo), thanks for posting your proposal. I love the detailed research that you have done. I hope you plan on submitting this on the Outreachy Website for your final proposal on Monday before 4 pm UTC.

Other things you could think about is other kinds of tests you could write. I have seen you mention unit tests, you could also mention if you will write system or feature tests. Also, you could think about how your work affects accessibility.

All the best and thank you!
