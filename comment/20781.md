I am not sure what "full spectrum" means when used to describe LEDs. It probably means that all the visible wavelengths are present in the light at more or less the same intensity. It probably does not mean that near infrared light is present. NIR is not used by plants and does not help them grow, so grow lights would be wasting energy producing NIR. So if your LED grow lights are the only illumination, there will probably be no NIR impacting or reflecting from the foliage and a plant health measure like NDVI will have no meaning at all. In order to get meaningful NDVI results you will probably have to add a source of NIR light. This could be about half as bright as the red part of the visible illumination to mimic the red:NIR ratio in sunlight. The camera will not be as sensitive to NIR as it is to red light, so making the NIR source very bright can help exaggerate the brightness of NIR so your NDVI values are similar to legacy (e.g., satellite) NDVI.
