I think you just need a bigger filter or a smaller fan and it will work fine. I don't see much advantage in making an adapter plate to make these two sizes fit together.  Put the filter on the inlet side and it should hug right up against the fan grill by suction.  Maybe put a couple bungee cords on it.

The particles you'd typically find in Boston resulting from traffic are going to be small.  Thus you're going to want a high quality filter otherwise you're just kicking up more particles and blowing them around the room.  Also I would be concerned about filter efficiency for small particles--do the filters work correctly at the air speed of these box fans?  

and lastly, I'd want to see before and after studies: room without fan versus room with fan and filter.  which has more particles floating around?
