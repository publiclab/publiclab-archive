 Hi Ag8n,
Thanks for your interest.
No, we are not headed toward chromatography although the flow cell & spectrometer are pretty well set up for that application (and the valve could be re-purposed as an injector).
Rather, our plan is to develop experiments for teaching undergraduates about the mechanics of measuring chemical reaction rates.  This coming spring semester, we plan to develop a set of enzyme kinetics experiments for our biochemistry lab course.  Specifically, we will look at the effects of pH on the enzymatic hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylacetate by chymotrypsin.  This reaction is discussed fairly extensively in Lehninger's chapter on enzyme kinetics, so I anticipate this will be a reasonable system to tackle.
Best,
Jack
