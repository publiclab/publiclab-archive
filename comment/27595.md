Hi, i also really appreciate the proposal! One really small note is that for hashtag autocompletion, there is some good work on that here: https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor/pull/606 that could be useful! Also, just to clarify, the Question editor uses the main editor library at https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor/ while the comment editor is a separate codebase. But you're right, the image upload is a big problem, great catch!
