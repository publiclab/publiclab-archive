Hi [@amirberAgain](/profile/amirberAgain), thanks for sharing this. You are absolutely correct - I use an LED with a sunlike spectrum but it is a bit weak on the NIR side of things. Wavelenghts should essentially go close to 780nm but are not very strong on this end. 

Do you have experience with complementing full spectrum LEDs (or other light sources) with an incandescent light that is producing stronger NIR for NDVI analysis/purposes? Would be great to get a feeling if this would benefit the ndvi/plant health analysis :)
Better data would therefore lead to more confident scores when building my models around this.
