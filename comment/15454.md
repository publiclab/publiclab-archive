Hi, everybody!!! We've finally developed a new approach to posting/sharing/collaborating, and are looking at how this extends into hardware modifications as well. 

You can read a bit about the Questions system and the Activities system on these posts: [#activity-grids](/tag/activity-grids)

But, following up on this series of ideas, a few questions and one "Upgrade" have been posted which I hope will help us to take steps forward:

https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/09-16-2016/stability-upgrade-mockup-for-plab-spectrometer-3-0 (which riffs on ideas here and in other notes)

And one "replication" or "build" of that documented upgrade: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-20-2016/building-the-stoft-stability-upgrade-for-desktop-spectrometry-starter-kit-3-0

Formulating a question about light leaks/ambient light: https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/09-19-2016/how-can-i-reduce-ambient-light-inside-the-desktop-spectrometry-starter-kit -- I imagine this may lead to another "upgrade" or two, which others could replicate. 

I encourage folks to:

1. try out the upgrade and report back with results (replication!!!)
2. pose clear "answerable" questions which could lead to, or justify, new upgrades (i.e. define the specific problem the upgrade would solve, and how to measure it)
3. [post your own](https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry#Upgrades) upgrades [with clear instructions](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-17-2016/what-makes-a-good-activity) and invite others to replicate (and help them if they have trouble!)

Thanks!!!
