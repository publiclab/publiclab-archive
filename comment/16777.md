Well, comment sections are great for deep discussion, no problems there. I just think for example some of the questions here could also be broken out into posted questions -- perhaps so we could include more people in this phase of the work. 

For example, some of the questions Patrick asked are awesome -- and some of the 'design constraints' and materials brainstorming could also be something we could -- if well framed -- invite others to help out with. If you'd like I'm happy to repost bits of this to see how that might work?
