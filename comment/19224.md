That's quite a task [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet). I don't think it would be feasible to dynamically update the scheduler.
I found one possible solution [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32314848/rails-actionmailer-send-mail-at-a-specific-time). We could keep a column in user model (next_scheduled_email:datetime) which would be updated each time the mail is sent to user.
e.g. If I want to receive digest mails every two days,
SubscriptionMailer.send_digest().deliver_later(wait_until: 10.hours.from_now) (suppose) and update my next_scheduled_email to be 29th March, 2018 and so on.
This could be done for each user, each day (maybe at the beginning of the day). For each day only those users should be selected whose 'next_scheduled_email' is DateTime.now.to_date(i.e Today's date).
Not sure if it would work, [@warren](/profile/warren) is it worth giving a go?
