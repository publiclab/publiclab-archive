I think the Public Lab Store will ship filters to Europe: https://store.publiclab.org/collections/diy-infrared-photography/products/infragram-diy-filter-pack

You can [contact the KAPtery](http://kaptery.com/contact/) about special shipping arrangements for filter material: http://kaptery.com/product/wratten-25a-filter
