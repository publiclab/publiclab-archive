Hi [@liz](/profile/liz),  The SmART-Form project is a collaboration between engineering faculty at Ohio State University and Syracuse University, a public health nursing consultant, Public Lab, and community partners in Waycross, Georgia. Details about the project can be found here: https://publiclab.org/notes/nshapiro/10-17-2016/public-lab-awarded-nsf-funding-to-help-develop-low-cost-community-formaldehyde-monitoring-technique, and project updates will be presented here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/smart-form.
