Hi [@warren](/profile/warren), thanks for your reply. I checked the ribbon cable and it's look OK, but I installed again anyways, following the intructions in the tutorial (https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/05-20-2019/set-up-a-raspberry-pi-camera-with-pi-builder ). But when I connected the camera, the problem persist.

Any other idea of what's happening?

best regards,
J.
