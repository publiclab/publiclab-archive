Chris,

Thank you for your comments. I realize I should have provided a bit more information. Unfortunately a multispectral imager was not in my budget for this project, I realize that would have been the ideal tool. Some of the decisions on equipment was also outside my control, therefore I have to work with what I have.

The camera is the standard 12mp 4k camera that comes with the DJI Phantom 3 Pro. However the lens has been swapped for a PeauProductions 4.35mm (no distortion) Blue + NIR NDVI lens. Any details beyond that I unfortunately do not have. 

The white balance is set by me, to either cloudy or sunny, I forget which I used for the above photo, however when I actually start data collection it will be set across every image.

Calibration is something I wish to do, but am having a difficult time figuring out how to go about it. I have read up on the method described on Public Lab and what I do not understand is how I get the values for the .csv from whatever materials I am using, or the best materials to use for that matter. What I was considering is producing some panels and taking a photo and pulling the values from them and just a priori using that as a calibration method. Having exact values for NDVI for what I am doing is not as important as having consistent values. As said I need to be able to make comparisons between sites and over time.

I saw the floating point image I just was not sure what to do with it. I am very new to all of this, and especially FIji. It look like it should do what I need, I will have to play around with the tools some more. Thank you for pointing that out to me.

If you, or anyone else could, point me in the right direction when it comes to calibrating the process better it would be greatly appreciated. As said white balance will be set, I will have to look at the software, but I know I can set ISO, should be able to set shutter speed as well, aperture is fixed.

Thank you again for your response and suggestions.
