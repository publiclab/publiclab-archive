Hi, Dave - I'm circling back because I believe the new `subtract:` feature in Spectral Workbench 2.0 could enable you to do a standard gain correction (I'm hearing 'standard deduction' in my head, which is funny, but kind of similar -- i.e. it wouldn't be super accurate, but would be better than nothing, right?). But for now, the easiest way to try it out would be to upload a curve (as an image) which could be used as the standard. Is there any way you could upload a standard correction (for the sanm camera, for example, or even better for the camera that ships with the 3.0 Desktop Spectrometer) which we could use to test that out? We could try it vs. some lab specs to see how well the correction works. 

Also, can you link to your source for the 5780K spectrum? Thanks a lot, Dave!
