This is really interesting. I have read Ned's article too and it is clearly better contrast when using red filter versus blue.

I have just received my Canon s100 from Ebay and deciding on which red filter should I get. The one you used above (MidOpt DB660/850) looks like has some sort of noise compared to Event38's filter, do you know why?

What do you think about this red filter ?

These guys do also have some filter but I am not sure which one would fit.

Could you clarify a bit what do you mean by "VIS blue NIR red" and "VIS red NIR blue" ? They I understand it is that blue is not used at all in the red filter so why it is in the equation at all ?
