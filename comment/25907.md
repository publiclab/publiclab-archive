Hi, there are a couple of things to look out for: conversion of data types and not dividing by zero + contrast stretching and colormap to format the NDVI images . 

Sample code is below and more detailed post is at: 
https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/08-03-2018/ngb-ndvi-video-optimization-red-blue-manual-gain-control  Code is a mix of python and opencv but you can also use other python routines.   

--------------------------------

 # Get the individual colour components of the image
                b, g, r = cv2.split(image)


                [#start](/tag/start) video capture
                ret, image = cap.read()
                # Calculate the NDVI

                # Bottom of fraction
                bottom = (r.astype(float) + g.astype(float))
                bottom[bottom == 0] = 0.01  # Make sure we don't divide by zero!

                ndvi = (r.astype(float) - g) / bottom
                ndvi = contrast_stretch(ndvi)
                ndvi = ndvi.astype(np.uint8)
