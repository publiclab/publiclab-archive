OK, this guy is doing it with a $7,000 [Ocean Optics Jaz spectrometer](http://www.coleparmer.com/Product/Ocean_Optics_Jaz_UV_Visible_Spectrophotometer_with_Remote_Probe/WU-83500-20?referred_id=778&sku=8350020) and several lasers: https://www.flickr.com/photos/bob_81667/6811951183/in/set-72157624831829718/

We should try to match his results!
