I think the reason that the simple correction with a black body source works so well is that it is the worst case. As the measurement moves away from the locus the correction becomes less important to the measurement accuracy and the effect becomes less pronounced because the energy coming into the system is not as broadband.

It might work almost as well with the ideal black body curve data if somebody wants to try doing it in a spreadsheet on my latest data set. Generate a scaling factor that makes the topless file look an ideal 2856K black body, then use it to scale the file with the saddle and see what happens.

It would be a lot easier if we had more light or integration control.
