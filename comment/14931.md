How I'm doing it now is holding the two thermocouple wires in a pair of locking hemostats connected to the ground terminal of the welder. There is a graphite electrode connected to positive. I touch the ended of the wire to the electrode, press the button to discharge the capacitors and it makes an arc across the ends of the wire to the electrode, either melting tips of the wire, or vaporising the whole thing. 
One little thing that is kind of an issue is that the two wires are different alloys and have slightly different melting points/conductivity so the weld isn't uniform...and sometimes the wires don't actually weld together, just melt on the ends. I'm working with really fine wire (0.005" - 0.001" in diameter) so making points isn't really an issue. 
The thermocouples work off of established physical properties of metals....So while some calibration is obviously going to be needed, I think they are probably pretty close as is. Because I'm not soldering the wires together they'll probably be more accurate because there isn't a 3rd alloy in there muxing things up.
