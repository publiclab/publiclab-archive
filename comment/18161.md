Hi [@Greg_H](/profile/Greg_H),
If the altSPI files are not on your usb memory you can download them here: https://github.com/SmokyMountainScientific/altSPI  There should be a file with the .h extension and one with .cpp.  They both need to go in a folder called altSPI inside a folder called libraries which needs to be in your energia sketch folder.  
If this does not work, contact me at summers at wcu dot edu and we can figure out how to get a new board to you.
Best,
Jack
