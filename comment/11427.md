Jeff, No I have not made a wiki page yet for these models. That will be a fun project. Thingiverse certainly has a great user interface. By default, [my models there](http://www.thingiverse.com/cfastie/designs?sort=&filter=&search=KAPtery) each get labelled "licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution - Share Alike license." In addition, I add to the description of each model that it is " Published under [CERN OHL](http://publiclab.org/wiki/cern-ohl-11)."  It has been suggested that multiple licenses like that allow people to choose which ever one they want. These models were all published in research notes at Public Lab (except the timer box), so maybe the CERN OHL should have precedence. But I keep updating the models at Thingiverse, so the most recent ones are only there. That's probably the best way to do it because there have been several thousand downloads of the models there. That is not obvious because every time I update a model the counter gets reset to zero.
