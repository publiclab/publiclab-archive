   My quick perusal of the attached pdf didn't find anything about effects of humidity. What you say about humidity effecting size makes sense but I would suggest the question for people using optical sensors who are not part of some organized scientific project  is what effect within a bin, 2.5µg/m^3 for example, would high humidity have? My experience is that counts increase; which I would speculate is due to smaller particles which might not be counted under low humidity become visually large enough to be counted.
