Hi [@warren](/profile/warren),
Sequel to your reviews and feedbacks, I have updated my proposal to reflect the checks to be carried out to sync MK with the latest data from PL:

Data will be efficiently synced in 3 ways:

1. During the login process (Task 5 in my proposal)
2. Calling the PublicLab API in the current_user function to update the status and role of the current user (Task 6 in my proposal)
3. For users not logged in or attempting to login, a scheduled job can be carried out to update their data on MK when they are banned on PL (Task 7 in my proposal) .

Thank you!
