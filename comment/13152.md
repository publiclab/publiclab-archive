I like Pat's idea of bolting through a juice bottle.

Removing the neck of the bottle could allow good access to the camera, but the bottle shoulders would provide strength. The plate might have to be bent to keep the camera level. The plate should be pretty easy to make out of cheap aluminum. Tough plastic would also work but the shaft attachments would have to be different, and bending it would be an obstacle.
