Hi Gustrow, 
There are some folks in the northern virginia area that would like to invite you to an event this coming Monday April 12th on the National Mall. Can you please join the local listserve at https://groups.google.com/group/plots-baltimore-dc so we can get this info to you?
Thanks!
Yours, 
Liz
