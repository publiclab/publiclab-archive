OK - just answering my own question here, but I did a short research writeup on what I found:

### SpiderOak

https://spideroak.com/
  
**Pro:** Serious about UI/UX as a security issue. Seemlingly well-thought through and documented "threat-model based" architecture. 2-factor auth and interesting [warrant canary][1] program, though only every 6 months.

**Con:** While SO publishes the mobile app's source code, it's in a compressed "dump" meaning that a much narrower group of people likely interact with it or read through it for problems. And the desktop version's code is not published. As a result, not good at responding to or fixing vulnerabilities.

**History:** Published on vulnerabilities in related libraries, but not their own -- and they've had some which they [didn't fix for months][2], despite being alerted.

  
### Peerio

https://www.peerio.com/

**Pro:** User-friendly, open source client (not server, though a [thorough set of guarantees and non-guarantees][3]), regularly audited, fairly active development over past year (although quiet the past month). Free.  $5k bug bounty program, 2-factor auth.

**Con:** Not many?  

**History:** The resigned co-founder had been speaking about a theoretical different backdoor-ed version which would be sold to specific clients, not the standard version. No mention of vulnerabilities in their releases, which sounds a little too clean -- I'd prefer to hear that they found and fixed things. But their [bug bounty program][4] is a good thing. 

  
### Keybase

https://keybase.io/
  
**Pro:** Promising model with twitter-based verification, GUI coming soon. Cross platform, 10gb, open source with healthy active development.

**Con:** in alpha/beta, don't promise not to accidentally delete your data. Currently only command-line, so very limited usability and therefore lots of opportunities for misuse. 

**History:** Good responses to UI-based attack vector reports -- [resolved within 1 day][5]. Active bug bounty program [with recorded payouts][6] and fixes [within 1 day][7]. 


This is just my best understanding in an hour or so of research, and could change -- comments, other opinions, corrections welcome!
