The balloon can lift 1500g total, and the balloon itself weighs 350g.  A 500g payload should fly fine.

The balloon is not stabilized, and we use swivels to prevent the line from twisting with it.  You could definitely use it to rotate an antenna.  If the antenna's weight is off-center, the weight can prevent or slow rotation. 

IF you don't want it to rotate, even the slightest breeze will pull the line off center and allow the antenna to hang fairly motionless from the bottom of the balloon.  Then you could control rotation with a servo or something.

consider using a zeppelin antenna-- you have the space to hang a long omnidirectional antenna
