 Hi [@warren](/profile/warren),

**1.** So for showing all the contributors including the ones that you mentioned, we can use https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors for that but there's an extra step associated with it. For adding new contributors, we need to comment on the PR or issue in which he's involved and the comment should be something like,

```
[@allcontributors](/profile/allcontributors)[bot] add {username} for {emoji-tags like code, doc etc.}

```
The good thing is we can be flexible in the comment and no need to write that specific line only. For example,


[![Screenshot_from_2019-04-07_09-17-23.png](/i/31194)](/i/31194?s=o)

This would open a PR for adding that contributor (PR would contain changes in the targeted file).

Other than this downside (kind of), it's a perfect tool to gather a list of all types of contributors.

It includes a JSON config file through which we can control the target file (which will get updated every time we add someone). This is how it looks,

In our case, we can make the target file `index.html` (because README won't look good with 550+ contributors list) and show that `<div>` only when `#r=all` is there. Here's a look at index.html with that `div`,

What do you think? Leaving a comment to add contributor(s) is the extra work, the contributor himself can leave that comment but merging that PR is not upto him so it ensures reliability with some manual work... ðŸ¤” 


**2.** Add community toolbox to your site. To make the website easily adaptable by other orgs or people in general we need to make `index.html` flexible so that it can change according to the parameters..."data fetching" and "showing it to the user" part is already flexible I think because we provide URL Hash Parameters which take care of this already ( some updates are needed though ).
So for giving the user option for providing those parameters we can have a JSON file which can export values to `index.html`, it will make the job of project adaptation by others easy.

Like this? 

**3.** Showing the FTOs count.

We currently show FTO issues according to the repository entered in the URL. Are you talking about showing a total FTO issues count on the page across all repositories?
