 Thanks Petter, I'm using a headless Raspberry Pi so I don't have the option of writing a GUI application (without networking the stream and severely complicating things).

What I've done is written a script that takes a load of photos at different white balance settings to try and find the sweet spot.

I've got my new filter in now and my results are quite a bit better. I'm going to write a research note when I get things set up and I've taken a few rounds of photos.

I found your NDVI processing and it seems practically identical to mine, I hadn't used the vmin, vmax attributes of matplotlib to view the raw ndvi values (I had to truncate the negative values and scaled into 0-255 range), thats a nice trick that I'll have to try!
