Hi Paquicamus - I just went through my notes and realized I actually hadn't taken a spectra for 70% IPA or Methanol and posted it to spectralworkbench.org.  I remember doing the experiment as I wanted to make sure that these solvents don't melt the plastic cuvettes I'm using (they don't).   Dichloromethane will not work with my current cuvette situation, I need a quartz cuvette as it melts the plastics cuvettes I'm using.  I will try and get those pics up today or tomorrow on the wiki I use to track stuff, located here: http://publiclab.org/wiki/pesticide-detection-methods-development.
