Hi Mercy,

We did some test with the app this weekend, we are making the map this days, tell me if you want some images for test.
We use Samsung S3 and Sony Xperia SL, we had beter results in Xperia.

I think the feature threshold needs to be improved with some way to know if it's working or not.

If you want I already made an app than uses gyro+accel data, I can share the code if this can help you. We can use also the magnetometer for include rotation in metadata.

Regards
