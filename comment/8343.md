This is a nice design, well thought out. Here is an x3g file for printing it on a MakerBot Replicator 1 with these settings:
 
- PLA, right extruder, 200° C
- 45° C build plate 
- 10% infill, 1 shell, 0.20 layer height
- support on, no raft
- 120 mm/sec print, 190 mm/sec travel
- 250 layers, ~60 g, about 4.5 hours

If you plan to tap those bolt holes, one shell might not be enough.
