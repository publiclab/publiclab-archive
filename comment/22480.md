You can most definitely use spectrometers to detect different types of materials. All materials are composed differently and thus will absorb and reflect light distinctly. Using the spectral signatures acquired from the spectrometer of each material you can decipher what is what. One important thing to consider though is the range of the spectrum that each instrument measures and the materials you are exploring which can end up limiting your results depending on the task at hand.
