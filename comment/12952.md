[@DarkGreen](/profile/DarkGreen) - there's now a new calibration tool -- read about it here: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-30-2015/new-wavelength-calibration-procedure-preview-for-spectral-workbench-2-0

The Fraunhofer lines would be a good way to calibrate, but the big ones are in the infrared range. I think we can get a lot of mileage out of the mercury spectrum!
