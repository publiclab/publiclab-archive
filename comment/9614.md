<pre>Crude Oil Set # 1 shows the basic differences between petroleums / crude oils. 
This set comes with an information sheet and these 6 petroleum / crude oil samples: 

Paraffinic (light, sweet), Paraffinic-Naphthenic (light-medium, sweet-sour), 
Naphthenic (medium, sour), Aromatic- Intermediate (medium-heavy, sour), 
Aromatic-Naphthenic (heavy, sour), Aromatic-Asphaltic (extra-heavy, sour).  
To buy Crude Oil Set # 1 at $14.95 U.S. each, press the "Add to Cart" </pre>

Excited to prepare these with the steps at [Oil Testing Kit](/wiki/oil-testing-kit) at the [event on July 31](/notes/stevie/07-09-2014/a-new-orleans-event-samples-with-spectrometry)!
