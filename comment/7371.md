I noticed that you are capturing your test images from an oblique angle. Bidirectional reflectance at that angle may be creating "hot spots" in your image. It's just something to keep in mind when collecting & analyzing your data.

Also, the use of bright and dark targets is common for image calibration in biophysical remote sensing. White panels coated with barium sulfate or Spectralon are ideal because they have reflectances near 1 and have very little specular reflection. I recommended teflon because it is an inexpensive alternative to Spectralon yet has similar spectral properties - unless you buy really cheap teflon. I would be more concerned about NDVI saturating.
