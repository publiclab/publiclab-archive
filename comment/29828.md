I've learned plenty of information about microplastics from the video. 99% percent of the ocean's water is polluted. "Why?" you may ask. It is because almost all of our plastics are under water. People litter and majority of the time people litter and throw things on the ground or water; it goes into the ocean. Most of the time people litter; they are throwing down some type of plastic. It starts as a microplastic then degrades to a microplastic. These microplastics are getting into our waterways and food sources which causes microplastics pollution.
