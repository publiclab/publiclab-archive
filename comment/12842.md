This sounds great -- I added some relevant tags to connect your work with other work going on in PL. Thanks! Looking forward to following your work!

The freezing technique is genius! How did you come up with it? Like making ice wine. Are you sourcing your extraction methods from some literature you've found?

Also looping in [@ernestootero](/profile/ernestootero) who's been collecting suspected oil samples in the field, although from asphalt surfaces, not water. Thanks!
