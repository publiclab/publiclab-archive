I would like to use two cameras, one NoIR and one Normal and use my ArduPilotMega 2.5 to shot the photos with my UAV so i can create a map of my farm - I know it is possible but I am a complete raspberry pi noob - where do I start?

edit: ok.... just found the "introduction to noobs" link but tips are welcome :D

Thank you!
