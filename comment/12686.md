If it's helpful, we can probably ask some of the OTK beta participants for one, since a couple have access to lab spectrometers.

In your image/image comparison, I'm curious -- since we calibrate based on the 436nm blue line, what does that comparison look like if 546 and 436 are aligned, instead of the 405nm blue line? I'm interested in if the distortion in our spectra is accentuated towards the wavelength extremes, and if our match is better for the central lines.

This is tough. I think perhaps the best we can do is to try to get a dataset from a calibrated lab spectrometer and treat that as our reference, even if we don't know the identities of all the lines. Does that make sense?
