I'm late to the party, but a very cool topic! If you're interested in finding local collaborators, I might suggest reaching out to the Northwest regional list (you can find all of our lists here: https://publiclab.org/lists), but I would also encourage you to post more about your work here on the website! There has been a lot of interest in exploring remediation tools (including bio-tools) around here lately, and I suspect that folks would be really interested in the projects you're describing.
