Thanks [@liz](/profile/liz) ! the sterile sugar matrix sounds amazing. [@kosamari](/profile/kosamari) is cost the reason for the sugar matrix over petri dishes? Keeping the media sterile upon decent could be difficult. Potentially the expansion of the balloon at altitude could open an close the sterile media? 

i found this article that seemed to validate some low cost passive means of microbial assessment http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4593205/

I don't think we will be able to collect for 7 days with solar balloons. we would probably have 12 hours flights at the longest. Thanks for the head's up [@mathew](/profile/mathew) that this might cause some difficulties if we were seeking more-than-perforative images and data. These flights would be in Argentina, but plans are very much in flux. 

Thanks y'all!
