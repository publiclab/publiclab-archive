Hi, there are a few ways you might do this:

* There's a Python library for command line use that can be run on image sequences or videos: https://github.com/publiclab/infrapix 
* There's also this prototype I've been working on a bit which lets you drag an image into a sequence of processing steps, and it could be adapted for batch processing of NDVI as well, but it'd be a while before it's ready: https://github.com/jywarren/image-sequencer
* There's the Photo Monitoring Plugin for ImageJ, which is (i think) scriptable -- https://publiclab.org/wiki/photo-monitoring-plugin
