If we can determine the change in reading to be purely a function of distance alone, perhaps adding an ultrasonic rangefinder to the IR sensor/servo combination could give the necessary information to compensate for changes in temperature reading as the servo rotates... the function would need to be well defined, and would probably exist with some relatively compact set of spatial limits, but perhaps those would be bigger than the average room.

Or, better yet, Vertical Roomba!
