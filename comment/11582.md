Thanks Mathew for the link back!

The whole package should work perfectly now, I'm still working on implementing the input output part, where I can trigger the camera to take an ordinary picture should people see something of interest in their garden as well as the routine to cleanly shut down the pi (if needed).

I might write a research note on this to ask for help because I can't get it fixed.
