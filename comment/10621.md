###Further questions that need exploring:
Following some [literature](http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-21-9-11356)
* What does the data look like
* What is a positive result?
* What is a negative result?
* How does detection work?
* What wavelength do they use?
* Can we get a hold of a broad range IR light for IR spec characterisation or do we just use a single wavelength and stick with diffraction?

I am reading through this journal now/ by monday and will post findings as and when.
