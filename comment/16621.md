Hi [@liz](/profile/liz). De nada, 
I think this data portal is quite new.  Two years ago I contacted with the person in charge of the BsAs monitoring stations to calibrate my sensor and at least she was pretty jealous about validating the data. I don't know if anyone is using this data but I can ask around. 
Saludos
