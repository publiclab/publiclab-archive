The collection process would have worked better if we had a high elevated platform like a bridge and lowered the trawlers into the water to get a full sample of water rather than just scooping across a shallow portion of the river. The most common item I saw were soda cans, which take between 200 - 500 years to fully degrade in a landfill. Communities are affected by polluted waterways because the pollution affects the marine life of the ecosystem. Fish may eat plastics and then people may eat those fish, in turn consuming microplastics which cause illness and sometimes disease.
