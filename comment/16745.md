Hi, [@stella](/profile/stella) [@david-days](/profile/david-days) and [@ujitha](/profile/ujitha), and really anyone interested in email notifications -- i found a couple smaller projects which would require a job scheduler like ActionJob, but are more limited in scope. I think they could be a good starting project to try things out and get comfortable with the systems, before taking on the rest of the summer's work. Can you take a look at these two issues, and in particular [this comment](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/64#issuecomment-274906457)?

https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/milestone/9

Note that I've also created a milestone for this project, and that's something I think is a good idea for all projects -- to help you track completion, and be sure your planning process is visible through issues you create on GitHub.
