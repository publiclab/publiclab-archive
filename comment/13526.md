Ok, it was just a reflection in the earlier photo. Just good to check.
Could there be any issue with the DVD as a diffraction grating having been affected by the ethanol. I do remember folks talking about using it to remove some of the film, but the layer on the DVD which forms the grating has a few atoms thickness with 740nm lines and spaces so it's a delicate surface. I've always just found a piece where the film separated nicely. I suppose looking at the film in reflective mode, using the fluorescent source, you should see something reasonable reflected to your eye -- no spectrometer hardware involved. Just a thought.
