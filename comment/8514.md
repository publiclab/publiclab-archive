This has great potential. If you add a few extra pieces of styrofoam around the top of the bell, then the whole rig will float with the camera well out of the water. It should be easy to buy a $5 clear camera filter [(e.g., UV)](http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=uv+filter+37+mm&tag=googhydr-20&index=aps&hvadid=31137488690&hvpos=1t1&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15280946716114125058&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvdev=c&ref=pd_sl_5meu6kboip_b) and silicone it to a hole in a good plastic bag. Then you need to figure out how to hold the camera in front of the filter and it will be pretty water repellent. 

Or, since you must be buying new cameras regularly, buy a Powershot A590 ($30 on ebay) which has a secret magic removable ring as does the entire A540 to A630 product line:

Then buy a [$6.00 filter tube made to twist onto the camera](http://www.amazon.com/Adapter-Powershot-MagicFiber-Microfiber-Cleaning/dp/B0046JN3FK) and a [$5.00 filter](http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=uv+filter+37+mm&tag=googhydr-20&index=aps&hvadid=31137488690&hvpos=1t1&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15280946716114125058&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvdev=c&ref=pd_sl_5meu6kboip_b):

This holds the filter in front of the lens. Then do the silicone the filter to a hole in a plastic bag trick. The camera could survive a water landing. I just bought three of each: A590, filter tube, and filter for about $130. For another reason.
