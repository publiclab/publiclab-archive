Great to know a blue sky can produce a white balance setting with so much separation of the blue and red (NIR) channels. there is at least [one other example of this](http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/08-16-2013/visible-and-infragram-maps-of-goat-brush-control-along-arroyo-mocho-creek-livermore-ca) from California where the sun can be really deep blue. This is a handy way to do the white balance when the sky is just the right color (not as blue as when you did it earlier).

Your current setting looks like a good compromise. The NDVI of the tree leaves is right where it should be. The tree trunks are conspicuous anomalies. They should have very low NDVI values, but because they are so dark (both blue and NIR values are very low) the computed NDVI values can turn out to be just about anything. That setting could produce meaningful NDVI values for scenes of plants under even lighting. Of course the exact NDVI values will depend on both the plants and the quality of the light hitting them. Your current setting should produce good discrimination between foliage and non-foliage when both are similarly illuminated and similar in brightness.
