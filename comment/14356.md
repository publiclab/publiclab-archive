"Citizen scientist" is a phrase I picked up along the way (I think here, but I've also seen it around the web).  I think it's a good description of the approach by PublicLab's members, and it seems to be a good formal phrasing of the same concept that is behind a lot of "informal" work done by regular joes and janes who have a keen (and possibly inexplicable) interest in a particular technical area.  The Maker movement, countless Youtube channels, and the whole underground garage gen-mod and nuclear research groups are just a few examples.

 These kinds of activities have always been around (read about the origin of the Stirling engine sometime), but with the brave new networked world that we live in, it is entirely possible to help turn them into something new--or, at least, give them a boost.
