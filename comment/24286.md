I did this!

Hardware: Raspberry Pi Zero W
Software: Raspbian Stretch Lite, Windows 10 (on PC)
Connection: USB configured as ethernet device; SSH into the device using PuTTY

A major challenge for me was not realizing I didn't have Bonjour installed, DESPITE having iTunes installed! So the SSH into the pi was not working at all and out of desperation I installed Bonjour separately and that's what made it work. So just because you have iTunes doesn't mean you certainly have Bonjour.

Other than that, exactly following this tutorial, but replacing WIFI preconfiguration with the https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget/ethernet-gadget#if-you-are-using-windows-as-the-host-machine tutorial posted by Aleksi12358 in this comments section.
