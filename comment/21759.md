 Hi, all - i wanted to apologize to Benjamin because I'm really excited about the Ruby-based tag-relatedness research you've added here, and didn't express that or follow up with next steps. 

The long-standing project to have a tag visualization is really within reach now, and this makes its future ever more sustainable (since these libraries put to rest the concerns we'd had about how this would scale over time). I think we can go ahead with the manual curation of topics on one track, and bump up the automated detection of tag interrelatedness (and the display of a graph) at the same time. I've cross-copied some of these notes here: https://publiclab.org/questions/bsugar/01-25-2018/how-was-the-tag-graph-visualization-made and also am going to pick up the thread in https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1502 shortly with a first take at using `tagoverflow` in conjunction with a live (cached) dataset from PL.org. 

Of note to Eva is that we could think about both how a curated set of "featured" tags specifically focused on environmental justice issues might fit into this page, while also looking at how this tag visualization could play a role in presenting inter-related topical activity across the site based on the automated analysis of tag relatedness that [@bsugar](/profile/bsugar) has made possible. 

Thanks, all!
