salts, barium are indicators of produced water and TENORM.  I should share with you the technical paper that Stroud shared with me. 

I just got a request from oakville, LA for us to determine whether or not the Stella field

Here's a site we sampled for oil in the water, got back barium, oil, etc etc

 wells were still active, as there's permits saying that the wells are closed, but also residual (?) oiling abounds

And here's a case, with Hilcorp in Louisiana, were the company knew it had a problem, put up boom before the tropical storm, but was relying on us / Coast Guard to tell them whether the boom was necessary. This flight was several days after Barry, so this could have been leaking for a minute. NRC 125 3034 Hilcorp in Plaquemines Parish, 07 24 2019, company's response NRC 125 3044
