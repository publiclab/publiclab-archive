i forget to add some details :)

even if you use 2 arduino, at least in my scenario, and u want them communicate in some way, you have to use a common ground, that still give me problem of noise.

i have try with an esp8266 to make a wifi module version for ec, powered by battery, but the power usage of esp8266 it's too high to  have a set-it and forget solution (or at least a montly checked one)

that's my findings till now :)

if we can have a real isolator (not just an octocoupler, but something that isolate vcc and gnd too, then everything will be much much easier, even with ph/orp/ec all togheter.


as a note, how do you find atlasscentific things?
i don't like much the protocol of this things, and the price it's quite intresting :)


are you aware of a way to measure dissoved co2? this will be a game changer for a reef aquarium :) 
co2 with ph = kh. kh it's one of the most important params for a reef, and one of the less stable :)

what do u have? (speaking about aquarium)
