Hi [@matthew](/profile/matthew), great that you've got some images :)  Looking at your graticule, I think your illumination might be misaligned - the blue-yellow gradient around the lines is classic condenser misalignment, from what I've seen.  The design allows you to shove the illumination arm around a bit, if you give that a try it ought to move the halo around a bit and at some point it will disappear.  On my long-term to do list is a nice way to adjust this with some screws, but I've not built that yet...
