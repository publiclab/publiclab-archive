Wow, you must have used something really blue to white balance. Please let us know how you did that. The Infragram is definitely orange. It looks like it is too orange. The NDVI values for plants are mostly greater than 0.7.  So for this kind of scene you have to find a setting that produces Infragrams that are a little less orange. Unfortunately, there is no way to dial it back, you have to start over with a new custom white balance. That's why it would be nice to find a way to do the white balance with artificial light so it is repeatable regardless of weather. It would be fun to try a blue LED and an NIR LED illuminating the same white surface. Then the relative contribution of blue and NIR could be adjusted until the NDVI results are acceptable. If this worked it would tell us a lot about what white balance is doing.

The white balance setting should not influence how much NIR is leaking into the blue channel. That will be more or less constant and determined by the color filter array in front of the sensor. I am not sure why the blue channel is getting that posterized look. Your result is a great example of how an orange Infragram photo has a very dark blue channel and light red channel. The very red NDVI image indicates that each pixel has an NIR:blue ratio of about 9 (NDVI=0.8). The mean ratio for plants should be closer to 3 (NDVI = 0.5).
