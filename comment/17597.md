Nice to see this!

we made a openScad file later, to be able to parametrize the size, metric or other screws and materials thickness:

looking forward to see some suggestion and improvements.
the whole "laser" design was also develoiped in collabroative prototypeing sessions over years, mostly with cardboard and local materials from chopsticks to scrapmetal.

i added some slides after slide 30:
