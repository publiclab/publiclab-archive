Hi Esben,
Thanks for the comment, and thank you for your early work on the TCD1304.  That was instrumental in us getting this project as far as we have.
I apologize for not responding.  I do not know why I did not see this until now.  There was probably a notification but it must have been removed by a spam filter.
The groove density is 1200 lines / mm, the collimating lense is 20 mm round with a 100 mm focal length.  The focusing lens is rectangular, 20 mm x 50 mm.  I plan to sell the optics and electronics from my website (SmokyMtSci.com).  Right now, I am working on a version of the spectrometer based on the Teensy microcontroller board.  Once I have the firmware and user interface finalized, I will put everything on GitHub and make a bunch of youTube videos demonstrating how to build one of these.
I am working on getting information on this project up on my website.
Best regards,
Jack
