[@ramarro](/profile/ramarro) totally agree! When I first use their sensors, I also have the same problem. I asked them and was told to use several Arduino boards for each sensors....But now I think they are fully aware this problem ... 
Did you also buy EC from them? I have one problem with their EC is that it can not detect low concentration, what kind of water are you testing?
