Hi! This question might be a bit large for the format here, but thought I'd ping in resources from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Check out the [Fifth Assessment Report](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/). This report was completed in 2014. Great notes and information available on the broader site as well: http://www.ipcc.ch/
