Wow, cool --

> sheens which reminded us coal tar rather than oil. 

What about the sheens reminded you of coal tar vs. oil?

> We collected them with our newly acquired Coast Guard Oil Collection Kit. (small net on the picture below)

Was this successful? Did you see oil in the net, and how much did you have to skim? Was it hard, and what was it like to get the oil out of the net?

Great work!
