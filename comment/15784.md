Yes, definitely what I was thinking!   I'll save adding [notes:related-organizations] for the Barnraising to see who else might be interested in connecting organizations.

And I'm glad [@liz](/profile/liz) mentioned the SoCal Waste Stream mapping article as it was also what I was thinking.  I'll add notes:waste to the <a href="https://publiclab.org/wiki/waste">Waste wiki</a> soon. 

And the Geography of Public Lab project sounds amazing.  Is there space for first time code contributions to get involved?
