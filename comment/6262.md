hey wattminder,

what kind of contaminants can be expected? if they have a specific optical signature, then they can be detected with optical spectroscopy. technically, analyzing samples in transmission is quite different to acquiring reflectance spectra. you could either use a known, artificial light source or daylight to illuminate your sample; the later would keep the device simple and cheap. it really boils down to the type and concentration of pollutant you are looking for. from my side, i think it's definitely worth a try!

cheers, philipp
