[@maggpi](/profile/maggpi), this is definitely a relevant parameter to explore, what I'm missing here are a few equations which describe the relation between the line density, illuminated area, and wavelength. Take a look here as a starting point:

I'm not sure I got exactly how you set up your system, how sure are you that all LEDs are aligned? The 850, 950nm LEDs appear to be saturated. When saturation occurs photo-electrons can spill to pixels along the same line/column known as Blooming (I'm not sure it's relevant for the Rpi camera thou).
Possibly try to capture an image of a CFL lamp, while it doesn't have many features in the IR, you should be able to extract a clear calibration, and if you can set the exposure time to calibrate the second order as well you could get some real understanding on that overlap.
Another interesting approach would be to look at the RGB values: keep in mind that IR is hardly discernable between the RGB, while the second order will be most visible in the B channel. try looking there!
