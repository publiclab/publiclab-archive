The video " The DIY Community Microscope Kit" goes over a few topics dealing with the public organization, their aspirations, goals, and how they were founded. Essentially, after many events that caused harm to the environment such as the oil spill in the gulf; many citizens because to express worry and decided that they wanted to try and make a difference. This organization allows essentially anyone to do their own research and testing, as well as giving them a chance to have a role in bettering their society.
