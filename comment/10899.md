Hi Johan,

Although a shift in the red edge could indicate heavy metal stress it could also indicate a host of other types of stress. Monitoring the red edge is possible but it might not be inexpensive or practical since you would want to use a very narrow band filter. 

It might be possible to detect certain types of heavy metal stress remotely but you would almost certainly want lot of different narrow bands along the lines of an imaging spectrometer or hyperspectral imager and you'd also need to do a good bit of lab work with a spectrometer to tease out the subtle effects of different heavy metals.
