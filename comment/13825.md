I think [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) is back from GOSH in Switzerland, so maybe she can chime in, but I wanted to question specifically [@ethanbass](/profile/ethanbass)'s point:

> there have been several studies comparing the effects of excitation wavelength on the fluorescent emissions profiles from various types of oil. The findings are that the emission profile always shifts to the left, so that the leading edge of the spectrum lines up with the peak from your laser. (Downare and Mullins, 1995).

My understanding, which Gretchen confirmed on the phone, was that fluorescence is based on an intrinsic property of the sample's chemical makeup, and a given fluorescence mechanism does not shift wavelength due to different excitation light wavelengths. 

Can we try to reconcile that with the Downare & Mullins paper?
