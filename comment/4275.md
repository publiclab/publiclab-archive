I think you would have had more accurate results by diluting a strong batch of coffee.  That way the brewing variability would have been eliminated.  It is probably also easier to measure the liquid volume more accurately than the coffee volume.  The coffee might have been packed loosely or tightly - lots of variables to deal with while dilution is just a liquid measurement.
