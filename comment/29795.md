Believe it or not, during the seaon, this is on the weather segment of the local news.  The local water intakes (Cleveland) are often threatened by the algea blooms in lake Erie from the Toledo area.  So in the season, discussion of algae blooms is often in the news.  That's along with satellite images, forecast growth, when the water might need to be shut down, etc.  You get the idea.  That's  for at least the last few years.  Sorry, don't know what satellite the tv stations use.
