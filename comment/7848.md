Great report. There is obviously lots of skill at work to push the limits of the form. That's too bad about the camera shift. If all the photos are similar to the one you included above, you might have enough coverage for a map. A program like Lightroom or Bridge (with Photoshop) will batch crop a folder full of photos. Or just make a map in Photoshop and manually mask out the housing in each photo. That way you lose less of each photo.
