I worked a lot on lead with atomic aborpion(AA) and related techniques.  The two lead lines we normally used were 283 nm and 214 nm. Of course, these aren't visible.  One technique that we briefly studied in college, but I've never seen used, is atomic fluorescence spectroscopy.  I looked it up and saw all kinds of crazy set ups from easy to wild.  Thought I'd throw that in as a last thought. It might be worth looking into.
