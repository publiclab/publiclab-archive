The impact of the burmese python is an invasive species. They like to settle in the southern parts. The burmese python is an apex predator with low decreasing species rate, allowing them to thrive. As the burmese python is a apex predator, other species are fighting for food leaving those species to decline in numbers with the burmese snake at the top. They also reproduce alot creating more of the dangerous species.
Thanks to Public Lab for being a great website and to being an accommodating support of this class' environmental studies in the future.
