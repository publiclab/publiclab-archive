I took part in the OPEN SYSTEMS/PUBLIC LAB mapping during the Novum Festival. As someone engaged in citizen science here in Ireland I was charmed by the tools, but what really excited me was the strong potential of Balloon Mapping as a catalyst for public dialogue in the urban context. Yes, you could use drones to do this work (if you had the resources) but you see a balloon on a string and you instantly want to know who is at the end of that string and what they are up to! 

I look forward to being the first one to conduct a proactice experiment with this technique in Ireland, exploring a Bee's eye view of the foraging potential in Dublin's northwest inner city for the Lifeline Project Bí! http://desireland.ie/the-bait-hive-initiative/
