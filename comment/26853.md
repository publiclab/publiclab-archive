Hi [@giannispimenidis](/profile/giannispimenidis),
Sorry to hear that you are having difficulties.  The voltammagram does look odd.  To start off, try putting a resistor (10K to 20K ohms works well) across the working (black) and counter (red) electrode leads and connect the reference lead (green) to the  red lead.  That should give you a straight line when you run the experiment with a slope equal to the resistance, consistent with Ohm's law.  
If that tests out, let me know and tell me what your electrodes are and what your sample contains.  
What you show has a sloped linear part and a flat part.  The sloped part looks like what you would expect if the electrodes were bridged by a 1K ohm resistor (Ohm's law).  The flat part looks like what you see when the A to D converter is saturated, but if that were the case, the display should tell you.
Sorry, but I dont know what is going on.
Let me know what you find out.
You can email me at summers at wcu dot edu.
Good luck, Jack
