Nice explanation. I do this a few times a month and this is the same procedure accepted in Colorado. The one minor difference is the option to use composite sampling. Composite sampling is where the sample is taken at various points across the stream by walking across the stream and repeatedly dipping the sample bottle. The sampling procedure is then noted on the label as either GRAB or COMPOSITE.   Again, thanks for a nice write-up.
