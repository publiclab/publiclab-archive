yes!  the one on the left is perhaps problematic because of a battery cable entering the JST connector .. though maybe flat screw will be okay ... the two on the right might make it hard to route to the pins, but with the board extended, could be okay ...

how do y'all feel about just having one hole? would that be enough to secure & orient the board, with friction, given how small and light the board is?
