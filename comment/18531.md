I have tried several times to adjust the histogram of bad infrared photos. It has always failed and I don't know why. I assume it is because the adjustments made by a custom white balance are more complex than multiplying all blue values by a factor. So the factor might have to vary depending on the values in the other channels. If we knew the formula we could do it. The other problem is that our adjustment is made on a jpg photo which has already been processed (including gamma correction, etc.). That's why starting with RAW image files might be more successful. Ned seemed to think that he could calibrate jpg photos if he could undo the gamma correction, but I'm not sure he ever got that far.

Although manipulated jpg photos seem to produce lousy NDVI images with lots of artifacts, they sometimes manage to discriminate most foliage from most non-foliage. If that is all you want an NDVI image to do, and you are happy with lots of false positives and false negatives, shifting all the NIR values by some factor might be adequate.

If you are stuck with a camera that does not do custom white balance and does not do RAW, another option is to find a filter which does a better job with your camera. [Event 38 has sold a blue filter](https://event38.com/product/custom-ngb-filter-glass-for-diy-camera-conversion/) which makes very good NDVI images in some situations. Photos taken with any of the white balance presets from some cameras can be directly converted to NDVI with good results. Also, the [photos straight from the camera look a lot like traditional CIR photos](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/11-21-2014/fixed-wing-over-cocodrie).
