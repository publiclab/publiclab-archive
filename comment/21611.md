 Hi bps - apologies, the WIFI model was an older product, and I don't believe the current one has the WIFI feature (if you would like to return or exchange this camera, please reach out to shipping@publiclab.org). The camera can be converted to an IR camera with the IR filter conversion kit (available as an add-on for this product). You can see a little more about the [IR filter conversion kit here](https://store.publiclab.org/collections/featured-kits/products/infragram-diy-filter-pack?variant=1058088684). You don't necessarily need special software to work with the images, but there are some tools that can be helpful over at Infragram ([https://infragram.org/)](https://infragram.org/) and [Image Sequencer](http://sequencer.publiclab.org/examples/#steps=import-image{},blend{},ndvi{},colormap{}) that can help you get started.
