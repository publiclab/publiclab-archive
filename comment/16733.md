Hello!
Here's a quick note to students and fellow mentors to introduce myself.
I am the PublicLab.Org systems administrator, whose responsibility is to keep all of your projects running reliably, safely and with good performance!
I am a person with broad interests. I learned programming as a child and since then never lost the wonder to learn technologies. That is why it's a personal mission of mine to help spread _libre_ technologies to empower people to do good.

I've been active with _plots2_ development mostly in the periphery, at the place of integration and deployment of containers, as well as testing and deployment pipeline. I am good with web technologies and systems work. While Ruby isn't my main language of expertise (if you're curious, it's Python), I'm starting to like it!

I'm always glad to be of service and looking forward to be in touch with the students and aware of the different project's advance!
