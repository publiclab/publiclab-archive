**Session idea:** Why do people use Arduinos to make environmental data loggers? Are there alternatives?
.  
  
I can lead this discussion (30 minutes?). During this discussion we could decide on a follow up activity to build, test, or deploy a data logger.

[Some of my recent research notes](https://publiclab.org/profile/cfastie) are examples of data loggers based on Arduinos.

Anybody interested?
