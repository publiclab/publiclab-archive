These days  it's easy to hop on the internet and explore aerial maps to see mining violations. Drones can also help. 

As far as mining violations to look for...there's a whole slew that can be easily seen from imagery. 
- illegal fills
- improper re-seeding/reclamation based on bare patches of "reclaimed" mine lands
- rogue discharges that can be discolored orange, white, or black (if close to coal processing)
- runoff from holding ponds

[@junior_walk1337](/profile/junior_walk1337) takes drone footage of mine sites in WV, I'm sure he's seen a number of violations.
