Very cool to see what they came up with. I see they are using the velcro cable ties on the pole mount. And that they'd cut the zip tie at the end of the dowel to where it was just the fastener there...

I notice they only used one length of dowel, which was something I was worried about from my instructions; I think you'll always get better angle by using the two lengths of dowel (or at least a longer length of dowel). The short drop means less leverage, so the small weight of the camera is not enough to straighten out the natural curve of the PVC tubing. By having the camera hang the full 18" from the line, the angle would be more directly vertical than you see in the bottom photo.

These are so cool! Very exciting to see the ideas in use! 
Thanks for posting these. I'm excited to hear any feedback on the DIY mini kite kit, or the rigs in general.
