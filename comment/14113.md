I was just loving this even more after thinking more about it. Simply using timelapse is almost the same paradigm as the balloon mapping kit -- solve it with more memory and battery! It's almost like a balloon mapping kit without a balloon :-P -- it's even in a bottle! It's so great in its bypassing of, say, electronics skills or programming. 

I had a lot of great thoughts about video analysis -- graphing brightness/color of a selected region over time...
