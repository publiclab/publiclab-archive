Those are nice Mobius photos. It should be possible to correct for the wide angle distortion, but you can't correct for the fact that such a wide angle lens captures the tops of the trees near the center of the frame but the sides of the trees near the edges. So stitching Mobius photos into a map or panorama will always be tricky.  

FastieGram CIR and NDVI:

.  
The wide angle lens also makes NDVI tricky to interpret because sun angle influences color balance so NDVI values on one side of the image might not be comparable with those on the other side. That's less of a problem on cloudy days.
