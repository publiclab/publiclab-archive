I have problem with this. I cannot get my raspberry pi to connect to my wifi router. I have tried different thing in wpa_supplicant file that I found in different tutorials.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlCr09B2HZI
There it says to add these lines only: 
network={

ssid=“name”

psk=“password”

key_mgmt=WPA2-AES

}
Why there is no first line in that video that you can see in what this page says to put in there? Why there is no key_mgmt line in what this page says to put in there?
There seems to be many different things you can put in there but nothing works for me.

I changed key_mgmt line to WPA2-AES because that is encryption what my router uses. I did check it from settings page of my router when it is connected to my laptop by Ethernet cable. From that page I did check if my raspberry is connected to router and it is not.

In this tutorial there is lot more lines in wpa_supplicant file.
