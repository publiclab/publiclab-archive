Hi [@warren](/profile/warren) [@bsugar](/profile/bsugar) great piece, thanks...a lot of new contributors do use this for guidance...with the renaming of our base branches from `master` to `main` it been a little confusing and a contributor reached out asking if we could update this too. Thanks again
