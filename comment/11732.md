Well... if you're working on maximum photosynthetic capacity.  But that's not necessarily the same thing as actual capacity during the day (phi2).

My understanding (which is limited so feel free to argue here) is that fv/fm will show long term effects like photo-damage, but there are many possible reasons besides photo-damage which could produce changes in actual photosynthetic efficiency and biomass accumulation.

It is an interesting question though - do you see the same differences if you collect fv/fm at night?
