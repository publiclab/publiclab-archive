Scott,  
It doesn't look like you have any electronics for triggering the cameras. Do you have plans for syncing the shutters? If the synchrony is not very close, there will be reduced overlap between photo pairs which leads to rather unproductive alignment of the pairs. 

I think you should try a [Titan 2 Rig](http://fastie.net/kit-information/titan-2-rig/). I bet if you included all of the tubing bumpers it would almost float. Add a couple pieces of styrofoam and it will bob like a cork (albeit with cameras attached to it). It looks like you have a single line attachment to the kite line, so you could also benefit from a [Picavet](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-15-2014/pierre-s-plastic-picavet). Just think, no more spinning, much less swaying, more vertical photos, and both cameras are firmly attached, aligned, and lanyarded to the rig before you turn them on and make sure they are operating as desired.

I think there are three of the Public Lab MakerBot printers in NOLA. Surely you can get a Titan 2 Rig and Picavet printed up for you.
