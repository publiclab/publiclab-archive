I also like the prospect of an Atmega 328 with no SD card for logging. How much of the 32k memory would be available after flashing the program? 

Maybe we could formulate some questions/challenges on this site to frame out that project and get other people to dig into prototyping these. It's also a bit beyond my skill set at the moment but if we frame the challenge and constraints narrowly enough (like with the prices and parts you listed above, Chris) maybe we can inspire someone to take a crack at it!
