Bored with community debates ?: 
Download the new smart phone app for the Battle of Brooklyn game for the Marylander site here: http://untappedcities.com/2015/10/22/in-new-iphone-app-brooklyn-1776-players-battle-in-revolutionary-era-nyc/

The only way to win the game is to lose.

Hopefully, in honor of Veteran's Day, this is one battle we can win for those who lost their lives to make America's history possible.
