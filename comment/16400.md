Great, thank you, all -

I do want to say, when it comes to scheduling your work, we ask students to submit new code in small chunks which are self-contained and tested, once or twice per week, for comment and (if ready) for merging into the master branch. 

This is faster than many projects, and it means that we ask you to aggressively break up your work into small pieces, rather than work for weeks on a big project in one big chunk. This helps us provide good feedback, encourages modular code that's easy to read and is independently testable, and ensures you keep a rigorous schedule. 

As you're revising your proposals, please think about how to break up big projects. Even one like upgrading the Rails version could be broken up if you think about what we could change in the codebase to make it compatible even before we do the switch. And if you're changing a major interface, consider developing it alongside the existing one by "hiding" the new version as an optional beta, until we're more sure that it's ready, and then "switching it to default" after, rather than breaking a working system before we're sure it's all ready. I'm happy to help you figure out how to break up your work.
