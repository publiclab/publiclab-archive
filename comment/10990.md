I just wanted to +1 this post -- and although as [@btbonval](/profile/btbonval) points out, I am the only paid developer on these projects, I can only devote about 10-20% of my time towards them, not counting support and sysadmin work -- making these topics even more urgent. All of the goals [@justinmanley](/profile/justinmanley) outlines are ones I share, and in particular the last one: 

> Encourage software development best practices that will make Public Lab software more reliable, easier to maintain, less buggy, and longer-lived

This often falls by the wayside since we have such a use-driven development program -- that is to say, as Bryan points out, there are so many users of the software, and so relatively few developers. It's harder to explain or justify the need to take a step back and rearchitect a system, or to spend time writing tests, vs. adding a new feature folks really need. Also, new developers are rarely as interested in writing tests or refactoring code as they are in new features -- on reason we are very lucky to have involvement from folks like [@justinmanley](/profile/justinmanley). 

Finally, because of the very entrenched and opinionated user base (which as developers, we're very lucky to have), there is a very high emphasis on continuity. It's important to continue to support legacy interfaces and tools longer than would be ideal in other circumstances, because people have worked very hard to create and edit datasets which support their environmental monitoring needs. 

+1 also for modularity; this was one of the biggest reasons to tackle the Leaflet.DistortableImage project. MapKnitter also represents the "worst case scenario" -- as a project which was originally intended to do literally no part of it's current featureset, and much of which was written during a relative crisis -- the BP oil spill. Until now, we've never had time to go back and rearchitect it to "do things right", which makes this a very exciting time for the tool. 

I think it's also fair to say that SpectralWorkbench and *especially* Infragram.org are in need of a lot of this kind of work as well; publiclab.org too, but to a lesser degree, as it does actually have a barebones test suite. 

Anyhow, I'm very glad to see [@justinmanley](/profile/justinmanley) and others thinking about the PL community and long-term development sustainability; this is a discussion and process which we very much need to embark upon.
