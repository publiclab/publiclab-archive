Thanks for sharing your expertise, [@martenskram](/profile/martenskram).
I didn't know that bubblers were inefficient under 1-2  µm. Your information about flow & particles, especially the following-
 
 "You need both a high flow (0.5 to 2 times the room volume per hour) and a high collection efficiency in the range 0.2 - 4 µm. Bubblers tend to be quite inefficient under 1 - 2 µm."- is especially helpful-because I'm hoping to get the diatoms to eat very fine, possibly ultra-fine particles that a room air filter can't trap."

And you're right, I have no way to account for dusts made by baking, vacuuming and other household dust sources. 
Both of the above issues worry me.

On the other hand, my understanding is that diatoms can metabolize silica, unlike mammals.
I have 2 reasons for thinking this:
 1) (Anecdotal) Fish ponds near the silica mine & transload grow a lot of brown algae/ diatoms now during warmer months, which never happened before the mining started.
 The remedy for brown algae on fishpond and aquarium sites was to reduce the silica in the water
2) Concerning diatoms, and their consuming silica, wikipedia wrote:
" Diatom cells are contained within a unique silica cell wall comprising two separate valves (or shells). The biogenic silica that the cell wall is composed of is synthesised intracellularly by the polymerisation of silicic acid monomers...
...In the open ocean, the condition that typically causes diatom (spring) blooms to end is a lack of silicon. Unlike other nutrients, this is a major requirement solely of diatoms, so it is not regenerated in the plankton ecosystem as efficiently as, for instance, nitrogen orphosphorus nutrients. This can be seen in maps of surface nutrient concentrations – as nutrients decline along gradients, silicon is usually the first to be exhausted (followed normally by nitrogen then phosphorus)."
from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom

Since diatoms need silica to build their cell walls, I've been hoping they might help remove silica from the air. 

So I'm still curious about diatoms and silica dust. Home air filters that I googled filter particles down to 0.3 microns.
And on the chance this might filter out some very fine & ultra-fine particles, I think it's worth trying.
It's important to me to keep trying because I know a woman near here who has filters all over her house, and continues to have asthma and bronchial problems which disappear when she goes out of state to visit family or travel.

I'll change goals for this experiment, and make the goal to see if more diatoms grow in a tank with a bubbler than in a tank without a bubbler. That may mean changing the experiment to 2 households with the same equipment other than the bubbler, and comparing diatom growth in each. If they thrive at all under grow lights, as I hope.

Then, if, & this a very big if, diatoms grow more in the tank with the bubbler, there remains the problem of sorting out whether the bubbling helped the diatoms grow better, or the presence of silica in the water. 
The only way I can think of to begin with water that is without diatoms is to use distilled water. Maybe treated tap water would be ok; the
water where the homes have a silica dust problem, are using untreated well water.

Second, while I'll use the Dylos to measure particulates, listing date, weather & household activities that day, I'm not going to do other measurements.
If someone knows a good technique with which I can get better data, please let me know.  
I've been following the twists and turns of outdoor dust monitoring by [@mathew](/profile/mathew) and others, e.g. this recent post:   https://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/12-22-2015/passive-particle-monitor-deployments-feedback

Thanks again for helping me think through this.
