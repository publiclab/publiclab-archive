Nice "sanity check" for pm "real time" monitors.  I'd suggest it is always good practice  when testing to make use of original data, in the case of purple air that would mean the logged concentrations. Below is a graph using the recorded concentrations that I downloaded. There is certainly a drop in concentrations but it is not to zero. 
Sorry I don't understand how to put an image here.
