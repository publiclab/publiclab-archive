hi [@guolivar](/profile/guolivar), thanks a lot for the feedback, much appreciated. i understand that this is a practical, empirical solution, that could be correct most of the time, but still it is quite a simplification. i had a look at the 2 scientific articles that the DustDuino wiki refers to ('data quality') but they don't provide any detail about the sensor's P1 and P2 channels and how the measurements should be calibrated. the DustDuino sketches use an average radius of 0.44 micron for the P1-P2 range (diamter 1-2.5 micron; a bit odd) and radius 2.6 micron for the P2 range (diameter >2.5 micron). i think this is the correlation that you refer to above; is this based on those scientific articles?
fyi, i've summed up a couple of remarks on my blog, http://lantaukwcounter.blogspot.hk/2015/10/pdd42-sensor-can-it-measure-pm10-and.html
