This is what I see in exiftool: https://gist.github.com/jywarren/4524b8ed092dc639c2e6

    GPS Altitude                    : 0 m Above Sea Level

But can we have a better default for that? It was just an android phone photo from a Nexus 5, so perhaps many android phones do not provide altitude. Can we default it to, say, 500ft or something? Or perhaps once you upload it, it could prompt you for how high it was? It could:

1. check older photos on that map for existing altitude
2. ask the user if there are none, providing a default value of 500ft, or maybe 500,1000,1500 feet options?
