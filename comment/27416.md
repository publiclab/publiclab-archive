[@eymund](/profile/eymund), I know this is an older project -- though I really enjoy reading and listening to the stories! Really fascinating. Do you have a step-by-step of how you initially started this project? Would you encourage sorting out areas of interest first through oral histories, old library archives, then compare these to google maps? Would love to hear how you'd encourage someone starting their own localized CSI!
