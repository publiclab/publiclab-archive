Hi [@liz](/profile/liz) thanks for reviewing my proposal.
I have made the flow chart. The workflow is as under

1)The client first of sign up through our https://publiclab.org/signup page. Now he can access his account.

2) If the user wants to login through provider say twitter than he will go to PL.org/profile/edit and will link up the twitter account. If he wishes to link other providers fb, google, github etc he can via this page.

3) Now the user logs out

4)Now he can access the account in a single step by just clicking on the login through twitter button as I listed in one of the mockups.

 If we need a way to directly sign up we could add buttons on the /sginup to sign up through the providers. Does this makes sense? If still I am not clear please ping me, I am there to clarify.
