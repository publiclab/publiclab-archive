Adam, You must be right that some protocols for identifying substances require knowledge of the absolute intensity of spectral peaks.  I am not familiar with most of the ways a spectrometer can be used, so I don't know how absolute intensity can be useful. One standard protocol is to determine if a substance is emitting or absorbing a particular wavelength. The absolute intensity of the emission or absorption can help pin down the identification, but is often not required.  For example, <a href="https://spectralworkbench.org/sets/show/90">this spectrum of a red discharge tube</a> that was made with a PLOTS spectrometer is overlain on the standard emission lines of neon.  There is no information about the relative or absolute intensity of the standard neon lines (so they are spectral lines, not peaks). Nonetheless, the spectrograph is a very good fit. The peaks of the spectrograph align fairly well with the standard neon lines, so this spectrograph can be assigned with some confidence to neon. No need for any intensity information (relative or absolute), much less calibration. Maybe someone can describe a protocol that requires intensity information.
