Awesome - down the road I wonder if we could connect w ushahidi to use the blurred location form we developed for public lab...

https://publiclab.github.io/leaflet-blurred-location/examples/

I know some ushahidi folks if you're interested... But it might be a slower project then this use case, [@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2)
