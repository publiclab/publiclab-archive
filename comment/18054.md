Hi [@squattingdog](/profile/squattingdog), just thought I'd pop up and say that the openflexure microscope is still very much under active development - I've improved my build instructions and (finally) got them online at the github repository:
https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope/

The basic microscope linked above is probably a simpler starting point - the openflexure microscope is aimed at the high-magnification end of things, where good motion control becomes super important and automating the motion of the stage really matters.
