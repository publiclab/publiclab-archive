Hi - There used to be a "Downloads" link but I just checked and couldn't find it. I only had the source files in the Git repository.  To get around this I added a new directory on the main PhotoMonitoring GitHub page called "downloads" and put the jar files, PDF version of the user guide, and LUTS in it. Let me know if you are able to get those files. 

Sorry for the trouble,

Ned
