[@warren](/profile/warren) [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) I have just updated the timeline and added the Mapknitter Export project to this. I've made some plans and since with Google's updated timeline we'll have a couple more weeks for the project. So I think I'll be able to accomplish both projects at once. For the Exporting project  I've made some scheduling through the planning issues you've provided me, but if I'm selected I'd like to get some planning to do with you mentors - I have covered this in my proposal though.
