Hi Mat, have you thought of using a microscope? you can get ones that connect to smartphones, which depending on your phone should give you good resolution, I saw from one of your other posts that you have used polarizing filters before as well, can I suggest that a 90 degree off set might not be the most ideal, most crystals don't rotate light by that much. Myself and Amy are currently looking at a similar method for fast asbestos detection and would be grateful if you would rekindle this project since they are both very similar.
