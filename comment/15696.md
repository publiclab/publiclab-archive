Jeff, yes, the data is being collected, and yes, higher resolution does improve observation of detail like slit differences. I'm evolving some new matlab code for performing measurements with 3 camera types; looking to observe the effects and limits of camera factors and I'll write a new note once I have good comparison data. However, it's also looking like camera pixel density is not the only factor for improving spectral resolution. I'll add a small clip of a slit comparison plot to the update (above) in this note. It's become clear that improving resolution, improving gain accuracy and improving overall repeatability at the same time requires some additional care with both hardware and software processing.
