Dear Dr. Summers,

I ordered WheeStat 5.1 potentiostat from OSH Park and built a potentiostat system as described here. Everything seems fine except when I'd like to use the Wheestat software (at first testing with the resistor) I get very random data points, without any relation. The voltage range of these data points is also different from set voltage range (-400 - 400 mV), it vary between 1100-1600 mV. I tried to use newer software version, but the results were the same. Do you have idea what is the problem or have you met a problem like this before?

Thanks in advance!
László
