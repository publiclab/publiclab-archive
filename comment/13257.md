[@pdhixenbaugh](/profile/pdhixenbaugh) -- the latest version of the Riffle (Beta 0.1.1) will have two battery ports -- one for rechargeable Lipos, and one that can take in any battery chemistry (with no recharging) -- thanks for pinging about this -- I think it was an earlier request of yours that prompted us to make the tweak, and it's a really good idea re: accessibility. 

By the way, here's a snap of the latest version of the board (hand model: Emilie) w/out any parts on it yet:

You can see the twin battery ports on the bottom of the board.  

Cheers!
