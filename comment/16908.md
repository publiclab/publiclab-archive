Hi Warren, I think that would be a good idea for the screw-terminal logger, as it's a generic, and would provide people with lots of flexibility to modify it for their particular project.  But I'm totally swamped at the moment prepping for fieldwork, and we still have not gotten our first pub out the door so I'm kind of cautious about any republishing till we get that into review.  One of the big things I need to get ready for that pub is a complete overhaul of the loggers codebase for release on GitHub - right now its a herd of cats.

But I really like the work you guys are doing at Public Lab. So could I put that feature post off for a month or so?  Also I'll have some decent run time with those low current modifications (as opposed to my acccelerated testing), so we will know if they are really safe for people to implement..
