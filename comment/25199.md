Good catch on DNR! I'll edit now. For the other one, people will have full printouts of the folder with them, so they would have the full pages for the "Report Form" and the "report form guide." I agree the full pages look tiny here, but I'm afraid if I split them up, people wouldn't flip the page to see the guide in blue. Maybe I'll change it to show images of just the tops of the pages so they don't look so small? I'll edit it that way in a minute to see how that looks. They're just reference photos.
