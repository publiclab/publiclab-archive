Okay, so translating the co-occurrences to Ruby will require a bit more code then I thought it would be (see second paragraph).  Unfortunately, I can't find any co-occurrence libraries in Ruby (you might have better luck).  

However, there are a bunch of recommendation engines available in Ruby which I guess makes more sense given Ruby's popularity as a back end for websites which inevitably include e-commerce.  [Reccomendify](https://github.com/asmuth/recommendify#synopsis) made sense to me right away. What you could do is instead of users purchasing products , you could treat each post as a user who "purchases" tags.  There's also [Recommendable](https://davidcel.is/recommendable/) but it was more opaque to me.

If you want to use the method that was employed to make the graph above minus the making of the graph, you'd have to translate [this code](https://github.com/stared/tag-graph-map-of-stackexchange/blob/master/tag_bundle_processing.py) and run it in the Ruby version of [these commands](https://github.com/stared/tag-graph-map-of-stackexchange#beta-sites-and-other-tags).  You do not need the `export2graphml` function.  

Essentially, you want a file that looks like [this](https://github.com/stared/tag-graph-map-of-stackexchange/blob/master/se_oe_tables/eo_stats_64.csv).  It won't be hard to calculate the counts of the tags individually, but trickier part is counting the co-occurrences.  But once you have those figures, calculating observed to expected ratio is easy and detailed [here](https://github.com/stared/tagoverflow#methods-and-tricks).
