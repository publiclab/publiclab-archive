Hi, I believe you should be able to override the `$W.getCrossSection()` function here: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/capture.js#L180

and it'll run each time a sample is collected -- many times per second. Exciting to see what you're doing! Please share some build photos if you can! :-)
