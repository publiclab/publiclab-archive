Just chipping in on this, subscribing to the tag "question:balloon-mapping" subscribes you to all questions posted on the topic "balloon-mapping". So the "answer questions" button shown at https://publiclab.org/tag/balloon-mapping will allow people to follow as Stevie describes. 

> sort questions by tags

Yes, you can go to https://publiclab.org/tag/question:balloon-mapping and see all the questions about balloon mapping. Some better place to list questions by different topics, or show common questions by topic, would be interesting. 

Great questions and comments -- i echo Stevie's enthusiasm!
