Just tested, didn't work. 

    Phone: Xiaomi MI3C, MIUI 7.1.2 (Android 4.4.4)
    Component Values: R1, 2.2k; R2, 2.2k, C1, 2ÂµF; R3, 10k. 
>I also tried some other configurations and values but same thing. 

One note of interest is that my phone sends out a pulse about every 40ms. 
This is the voltage between the sleeve and ring2 without the Arduino attached at all.

This is with the Arduino sending its signal. Would the pulses be an issue?...hmmmm....

Here is the audio (which comes through fine!).
