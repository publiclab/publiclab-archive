I'm happy for this my first step in NIR and NDVI photograph!
Maybe you know but .....
1) I use not a real camera but a computer board (Raspberry Pi) + solar battery pack and equipped with IR modulo cam + blue filter. 
2) Raspberry Pi has linux based OS Raspbian 
3) I use a line command software (Raspistill) to shoot a photos.  
4) The camera use automatic white balance for each photo as default but the photos that I posted had no automatic white balance but a custom white balance that I set by line command of raspistill.
4) the line command of the last photo (the pretty good one) was: "raspistill awb off awbg 0.88,0.58 -v -o test088058.jpg"   
5) There is no zoom in the modulo cam :( so I can shoot just far from 1 meter to infininity because of the focus

have a look at the photo to see my camera

I could post other photos of plants in a little bit different custom white balance, if you think this will be usefull.

Thanks a lot for all
