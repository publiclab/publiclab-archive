Yay!

[@mathew](/profile/mathew):  Great!  And we already have a pretty nice relevant smt board design -- coin cell powered, with an RGB led and a piezo buzzer:  http://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/03-02-2014/thermal-flashlight-reva-first-tests -- and can easily swap out the microcontroller in that design with a 555 ... it'd also be nice to add a switch that chooses audio jack vs piezo buzzer output, and a switch to choose various capacitors on the 555, so that various conductivity ranges could be addressed ....

[@warren](/profile/warren) -- super!  We could easily do that!  Super cool ... is there some pre-fab container (single-serving shampoo bottles, or etc) that would be fun and practical as weatherproof containers? We can design the circuit board to fit inside something clever ...

One of the ideas that came up at the workshop was to add an RC high-pass filter on the 555 output, so that it would only 'chirp' when the conductivity spiked above a certain threshold  (tuneable, with a potentiometer, and/or a switch among various capacitors) -- this way you could use the device as an 'alarm' in your toilet resevoir -- a super-cheap and simple version of the [CATTFISH](http://www.cmucreatelab.org/projects/Water_Quality_Monitoring/pages/CATTFish) idea ...

Wheee!
