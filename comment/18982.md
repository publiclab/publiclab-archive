Thanks so much !

1.) The hashtag idea is great ! Yes we can do that . 

2.) And regarding the JS library , I really think we should do that to standardize the use of maps at all places . Saying that , TBH i would need your help as to what will be the flow of code  . I am comfortable with `Leaflet library` , `Vanilla Javascript` and `Jquery`  ,  have basic knowlege of `NodeJS` and `NPM` and `gruntJS`  and `Jasmine Framework for testing` . 

By studying this awesome library : https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor , I am able to understand how this works . I am sure with the time we have before the summer and with your guidance i can learn how to create consistent and maintainable JS library . 

This will be exciting and i would love the opportunity to create a JS library from scratch for PublicLab ! Thanks :)
