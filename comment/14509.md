[@warren](/profile/warren): 
in response to: "Can you try re-calibrating this one, as I think it was calibrated during a brief bug (it shows being calibrated on 1/26/16) which was since fixed. I hope that will fix at least one of your graphs: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/69433"

- I tried to recalibrate pretty hard but did not worked out. Actually I am not sure how to compare this particular spectrum to the SW calibration sample. I have  a feeling that this CFL daylight spectrum we are talking about is missing some of the peaks necessary for the calibration.  Or perhaps I am having a hard time locating them. Does someone have any suggestions about this?
