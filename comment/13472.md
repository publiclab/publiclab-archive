This is fantastic! The wood mounted maps and the viewer assuming the balloon's-eye-view is really nicely done. The detail of the kids holding hands on the court is a very sweet break in tone within a very serious intervention. Hopefully the privacy afforded by censorship can be used as a space for planning the next even bigger and badder exhibit. I would love to see the booklet.
