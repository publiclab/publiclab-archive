[@programmer1200](/profile/programmer1200), This is great! I agree with Chris and Holger that light scattering at a 90-degree angle is the standard approach for turbidity, and your setup looks roomy enough to accommodate that sensor placement. I'm excited to see this! I'd be curious to compare different suspended sediment concentrations and compositions. 
[@Holger](/profile/Holger), great tip about the bakers yeast!!
