Hi,
Not sure if this is a direct match with your project but I can share some of my work on real time spectrum processing.

This  video shows  how a trackbar is used to select a line which is then displayed on a matplotlib graph. The plot displays the  spectrum’s RGB components and is updated at video frame rates.     The video shows examples for a CFL and white light spectrum.   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyGCIxKjT9s  (The plot shows intensity for a single line of video)

A single frame is also on the spectral workbench site and the RGB split seems to compare well with the real time results.    https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/139348

The spectrum was taken with a Public Lab Lego spectrometer kit with  Raspberry Pi NoIR camera.  ( These comments may  apply to other designs as well.)   I am still fine tuning things but here is a list of  mods to the Lego design(see picture below):  

-Raspberry Pi camera mount – During my first install I used sticky tape backing to hold the camera and the camera stopped working.   Not really sure if  it was the tape or something else but it spooked me.   I switched to a  3d printed part  (https://publiclab.org/notes/partsandcrafts/12-02-2017/quick-build-raspberry-pi-microscope)   that is the camera holder for the Public Lab microscope.   (The camera does not have a flat back so without a holder it can rock back and forth.)  Could not have done this without the help of  [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) .

-Side mounted design: The Lego spectrometer design has the cable coming out from the top, my design comes  out the side.   The   goal is try to use the NoIR camera to capture spectral data to 1000nm and I wanted to have the long side of the array to match the horizontal spectrum.

-Extra long camera cable: Assume you are going to have some type of GPIO connection  to manage the LEDs.  You may want to have at a meter length camera cable to give you some working room.

In terms of calibration –
-Getting calibration  thru the spectrum workbench GUI  seems like a solid approach but it may be something that cannot be completely automated.
-I have been thinking about using opencv color analysis to set an auto calibration scale. One possible option would be to  use computer vision to overlay different color masks and build up some type of cross reference between RGB colorspace and wavelength.   Still working on this put you can see color mask sorting at:   https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/07-09-2018/computer-vision-color-detection  
-Do you really need calibration? Could you just  take the spectra  and make a selection based on comparisons to prior measurements? 

Have fun at hacking camp.  I would recommend having a good working spectrometer before you go so you can concentrate on everything else during the camp.
