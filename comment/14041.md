This is so great.

Quick question:  I could imagine extending the battery on a Mobius by controlling a USB power source with a switch:  i.e., one could supply power only when one wanted to take a photo.  If this is a useful idea, then I'm still not sure how we'd turn the Mobius camera on, once it has power.  But then, once it's on, I assume that this mode you've dialed in will simply take a photo automatically?  

So, I'm imagining a configuration like:

Mobius + switchable power

Protocol:

1. Turn on the power (with a microcontroller) at a specific time
2. Turn on the Mobius (somehow?)
3. Take a photo (because of pre-selected mode, or triggered via USB, or?)
4. Turn off the power for X minutes
[ Repeat ]

Is that doable? 

Also: if you have a multimeter, and can sacrifice a 3.7 volt battery, you could hook it up and measure the current (in milliAmps) when the camera  is on, and when it's sleeping, and then we could estimate how long field deployments would last in various modes ...

So great that you're digging into this!
