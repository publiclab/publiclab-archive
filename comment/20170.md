Wow, thanks for the great response!   I did this fairly quickly and I will try to  catch up with the questions: 
 
1.	did you illuminate these separately at separate times?
Yes, first visible and then IR. 
2.	did you use the same, full-open camera and only change the light, instead of filtering separately?
Yes and No , the camera settings were the same and there were no physical changes to the camera (except light swap) BUT the Raspberry Pi NoIR camera automatic gain control (AGC) was on.   Most likely different gain settings were used.  
3.  Is that a cross section of a living pine needle?  No, most likely dead for years.   
4.  I assume you used the red channel in the RGB photo for your red data?  No, it was RGB. 

Here is reprocessed RGB split version.  It’s not exactly the same as before since the IR is also split.

5.   Did you use a Pi NoIR camera to take both photos? Yes, 
6a. How much NIR was emitted by the white LED?  Not certain.  
6b  How much of that NIR was captured by the red channel in the sensor?  Not certain

My initial thinking is that given the  100nm separation between the WHT / IR (850nm) LEDs  and the high output; the amount of overlap would be difficult to notice. 

---------------------------
Comment 1: Since the LED source approach doesn’t ratio the sun’s energy it seems inappropriate to  call it an NDVI measurement.  The approach, however, may be useful in a different context.   1) It exploits the key NDVI  reflectance difference  between vis and IR.  2)  The basic equation  (Image A –Image B)/(Image A + Image B) 
seems useful for general image enhancement even if the input isn’t spectrally pure for a valid NDVI result. 3) It’s very easy to implement (on/off LEDS) and could also be easily  automated by the Raspberry Pi GPIO.

Comment 2.  Does seem like a lot of wasted work since  green chloroplasts are visible under white light.   Is it possible other (non green but with IR )plant areas contribute to NDVI response? 

Comment 3.  It might be possible to mimic the Red/NIR ratio better with other LEDs.  The likely candidates would be a red and IR (950nm) LED.   This would increase the spectral separation and they are both low cost.   See below for a red LED/ IR 850nm  trial on a pine cross section.

Appreciate  all the interest, comments and support.
