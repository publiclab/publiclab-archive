I have updated my proposal with the workflow for documenting bugs under development process refinement and added zoom level for maps. Also updated my timeline.
[@warren](/profile/warren) Thanks for the Heads up!

I'm thinking the web working group should then be able to see and review the reports when they get submitted  and then file an issue with the reports if similar issue is not already filed.  I don't know if this is your thought on how the reports should be handled as well. I would like to know if there is another way that could work better.
