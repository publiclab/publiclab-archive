Hi Rita,
Your photo above (NIR1_Red3_b.jpg) will not produce very good NDVI. Most of the pixels of plants have the same value in each of the three color channels. That is why the photo looks so gray. Healthy plants reflect a lot more NIR than red, so the NIR channel should much brighter (higher values) than the red channel. When NIR is captured in the blue channel (as with Wratten 25A) then healthy vegetation should look very blue (turquoise). When the values in the blue channel (NIR) are a few times greater than the values in the red channel (red), than NDVI values will be in the appropriate range.

To get the NIR channel (blue) to be brighter, a custom white balance must be done on the camera. The procedure (for blue filtered cameras) is here: [http://publiclab.org/wiki/infrablue-white-balance](http://publiclab.org/wiki/infrablue-white-balance). For red filtered cameras, substitute red paper in direct sunlight for blue paper in the shade. The idea is to flood the sensor with red light while the custom white balance procedure is done.

To make NDVI images, the channels do not have to be swapped. That procedure is for making false color IR images.
