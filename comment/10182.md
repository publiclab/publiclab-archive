Thank you Matthew!  I'm glad you appreciate it!  I'm having a great time creating this thing..

If CSV data can be imported, then that should be a slam dunk.  I can create an option to export to CSV no problem..  I will have to give the new browser a try.. I've been a little busy with other parts.. :)

I'd like to make a note too, I'm working on making the spectrometer portion of this work standalone too.  So someone could just build that part and use it without the rest of the raman portion..
