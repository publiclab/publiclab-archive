I may not be understanding this method fully but keep in mind that PM2.5 indicates particulate of aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5µm.  The "resolution" needs to be capable of distinguishing particulate less than 2.5µm not just about 2.5µm.  This is especially important when checking for silica where it is the smallest particulate that is said to be most of concern.
