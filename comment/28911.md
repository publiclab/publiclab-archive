Wanted to share this tool that supports both focusing on EJ communities and advocacy, through the current research area of mapping!  

As the Biden Administration has [launched](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/) the government-wide Justice40 Initiative with the goal of delivering 40 percent of the overall benefits of relevant federal investments to disadvantaged communities and tracks performance toward that goal through the establishment of an Environmental Justice Scorecard.

This tool, [EJScreen, ](https://ejscreen.epa.gov/mapper/)is an EPA mapping tool that lawyers for opponents of the Formosa Plastics Group complex used to demonstrate that residents of Welcome, located in Louisiana's St. James Parish, face an elevated risk of cancer due to industrial activity in their community.

This tool exemplifies the importance of public maps to identify disadvantaged communities, especially from a from an enforcement and policy-setting perspective and what the federal government will prioritize.
