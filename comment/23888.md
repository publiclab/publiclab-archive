Oops responded to the wrong comment, moving here:

Hi all! Great input here. Just noting that we've had a major revision to the PL spectrometer design that should address a lot of the rigidity issues, though perhaps not as much as [@stoft](/profile/stoft)'s wood design. In any case a major improvement over the paper box based design. You can read more about it at https://publiclab.org/lego
