So when I typed "$W.getCrossSection()" into the console I got:
TypeError: Failed to execute 'drawImage' on 'CanvasRenderingContext2D': The provided value is not of type '(CSSImageValue or HTMLImageElement or SVGImageElement or HTMLVideoElement or HTMLCanvasElement or ImageBitmap or OffscreenCanvas)'
    at Object.getCrossSection (capture-2378d6dbb368cce52b64ccc75b38a3a4.js:1)
    at <anonymous>:1:4 

Did I do something wrong?

Also thank you! I see if I can make a little blog post with what I've done so far, or maybe once I finish.
