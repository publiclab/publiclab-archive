Cversek -- wow, thank you!!! What a useful collection of info.  Your note convinced Ben to add a dual op-amp to buffer the conductivity output, and a low voltage drive rail.  He just updated the schematic, and I'm going to be trying to lay out the new board now.  Really great to have this commentary as part of this research note, for later reference. Thanks!

Kanarinka -- yes!  We're really honing in a relatively robust, inexpensive technique, it seems ... woohoo!
