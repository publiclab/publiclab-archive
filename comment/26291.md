Here's a recent one from Ronnie Hamrick, and the San Antonio Estuary Waterkeeper on nurdles from the Formosa plant ending up in the waterway.  For years community members documented and filed permit violations with the EPA and state agency resulting in fines against the company.  Now as a result of legal action and these documented complaints, there's a  $50million settlement on this case against the company for their continued bad acting. The Formosa plant has also agreed to a zero pellet discharge moving forward.

- This one outlines how the residents filed violations for years before the case moved forward https://www.texasobserver.org/nurdle-by-nurdle-citizens-took-on-a-billion-dollar-plastic-company-and-won/  "Most environmental pollution cases are based on already documented pollution, as companies file permit violations with a state agency like TCEQ, or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 'This is an instance where citizens collected evidence of violation of the Clean Water Act,' Johnson says, 'and whatâ€™s so powerful is that that was used to prove these thousands of violations.'"
