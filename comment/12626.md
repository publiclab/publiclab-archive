OK, I've filtered out the highest NIST peaks, and exported them in plain text. But these are in a vacuum, and for example, the 436.6nm line in the Wikipedia reference shows as 435.8335nm. Is this because it's in a vacuum? Or is 435.8335nm the more accurate number? [@stoft](/profile/stoft), any input on this?
