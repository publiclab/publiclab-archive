its always fascinating to me how visual and audio waveform data respond to similar technical approaches... 

I'm working on this color classifier: http://github.com/jywarren/clashifier 

where i've done a very very simple n-space cartesian distance search... it looks for each color, how different it is between 2 samples, and sums the differences.

it's designed for RGB or infrared+RGB images now, but the basic approach could be expanded for as many colors (or, wavelengths) as needed. I tried to write it in a modular way so that other, better matching algorithms can be swapped in.

BTW, i tagged your post "spectrometer" so it gets filed with other spectrometry research notes; hope you don't mind.
