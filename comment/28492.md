Generating independent files/code for anyone to add a specific layer to any map sound so cool.

agreed.

Has there been any existing layer, not necessarily spreadsheet based, being served as an independent file? If not I will try to experiment with some existing layers and see what exactly would we need to generate an independent code. I will open up an discussion thread on LEL repo for this if that sound right to you!

Update: I have included some details about this in my proposal now
