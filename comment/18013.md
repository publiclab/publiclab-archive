Hi [@Greg_H](/profile/Greg_H), sorry you are having trouble.  The microcontroller should be powered up, and it must be if you are getting any kind of readout at all.  What are the leads (alligator clips) attached to?  If you connect the black lead to  one side of a resistor (10 Kohm works well) and the other two leads to the other side of the resistor, you should get a straight line correlating voltage and current.  If you dont have the leads attached to anything, you will not get anything reasonable back.  Let me know how this works.
