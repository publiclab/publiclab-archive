Pat, they eventually captured enough hydrogen to lift the bag. The main problem with their setup was that it did not pressurize. The goal is to force the newly generated hydrogen into the second jug so it bubbles through cool water. This removes impurities including water vapor. Then the hydrogen flows into the balloon.  The Al + NaOH reaction produces enough pressure to do this, but you have to be brave enough to seal the system so nothing can escape.  If something clogs up, pressure could pop something and spew hot NaOH where you don't want it. All you need is old fashioned rubber stoppers that would just pop out if the pressure gets too high. They eventually abandoned the second jug and piped the hot, steamy hydrogen mix directly to the bag where it dissolved the aluminum lining and where the steam condensed and puddled.  Get them a couple of rubber stoppers, and next time they will no doubt be flying high.
