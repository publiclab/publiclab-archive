This is a great summary of sensor journalism, a topic that has puzzled me for a while. Selecting, assembling, deploying, and monitoring sensors, as well as summarizing, interpreting, and presenting the data they collect is a scientific pursuit. Without some appreciation for the pitfalls and assumptions associated with making scientific observations, results could do more harm than good. This summary alludes to these problems. If journalists have scientific experience or training, making scientific observations can be another journalistic tool. If not, maybe relying on qualified people to do it is a better idea. 

Journalists don't have to examine patients to report on health and medicine. They don't have to run for office to report on politics. They don't have to hammer nails to report on the housing business. Most journalists would do poorly at these tasks. Why do they suddenly think they can and should do science? 

Don't get me started on why "citizens" think they can suddenly be scientists.  Sheesh.
