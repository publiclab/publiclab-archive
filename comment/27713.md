Thanks for this info.. some very good points and ideas. This case study relies on government agencies to take and test the soil samples (which does save the community money). What happens of the agencies dont listen to the community? This is where residents can test their own soil..you know all this.. btw, we have this in the works too https://cscrsoiltesting.next.fieldscope.org/
