Hi gbathree,

we did a study on the "behaviour" of the greenness (Gcc) values across a day and across the year. In general the best values (greenest) are acquired on sunny days with a camera facing north (little shading as possible).

Below you can see the daily patterns of Gcc for sunny and and cloudy days for cameras pointing north. The pattern on sunny days is fairly symmetrical around solar noon. This changes when not pointing north. However, if you acquire enough images than using the 90th percentile of 3 consecutive days guarantees more or less that you will approximate a "good" Gcc value. Streaks of bad weather can pull the values down however. A few of the cameras take far less pictures (e.g. just around noon) and still deliver reasonable time series. However given that you rely on the distribution of good to bad images having more images makes for better final data.

My setup relies on the cameras being indoors, so additional measurements should be derived from image properties other than colour. I've worked on using texture instead of colour to look at seasonality. The figure below illustrates that there is a discrepancy between what you see using colour (red line) and what you see using texture (black dots). The "proof of concept" texture index is variable as I didn't smooth across days, due to the calculation intensive nature of the analysis. The black dots fall of way later in autumn than the Gcc (red line) values. This is due to the fact that a changes in the physical structure of the canopy in autumn do not align with changes in colour. In spring leaf development coincides with an increase in greenness, in autumn leaf drop isn't necessarily synchronous with leaf coloration (most of the time far from it actually).

Additional measurements, using other sensors will be difficult I fear due to the fact that you are indoors and mostly orthogonal to the sky. You could measure broadband radiation using a simple LED sensor, but this would add little data but would increase complexity a lot. The link to the full article is [here](http://environment.snu.ac.kr/papers/Ryu_2010_AFM3.pdf). A more complex setup can be found in my other remote sensing notes, the multispectral camera. This opens up some opportunities but again increases complexity and cost (beyond a citizen science / schoolyard budget).

The planet labs data is interesting for sure but as with most high resolution data it is prohibitively expensive (especially if you want to do continuous monitoring).
