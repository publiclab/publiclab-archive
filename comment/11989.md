That's pretty gutsy flying right there in the hood. Very impressive.

The default mode (Mode 0) has eight pan positions. The A495 needs more than that. Modes 2 to 5 have nine pan positions. Mode 2 would be a good one to try with the A495. But 10 pan positions would probably be better, so the sketch will have to be edited. 

I had a hard time telling which LEDs were lit in full sunlight, so a dark cloak or something is needed to block the light while the mode is being selected. The next version is going to have a DIP switch instead of LEDs. So if the new PCB works that problem will be solved. 

You can drag a jpg right into a comment just as you do in the note.

Thanks for your feedback.
