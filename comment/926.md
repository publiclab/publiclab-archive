Maybe this categorization could be crowd sourced. Every hardware/technique wiki or research note could encourage voting on two questions:

Is it easy?  No (1pt)   Meh (2 pts)   Very (3 pts)

Is it Awesome? Some (1 pt)  More (2 pts)  Wicked (3 pts)

Each note/wiki then gets a badge based on the score:

5-6 = You've got to try this!
3-4 = Probably worthwhile.
2  = A niche solution.
