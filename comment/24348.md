 Getting the solar spectrum was a good idea.  Clearly, the lines in this are not due to the light source and must be attributed to the detector.  One question I would ask is whether the darker or brighter bands show up at the same row every time or whether they appear randomly.  It looks pretty random in the figures, but I dont know how the data is processed.  
It might be informative to see plots of intensity versus pixel number for representative rows. From the figures, it looks like the background (dark current from the detector) is significantly different in the different rows.  I believe that thermal noise in the electronics could contribute significantly to the background.  From the color plots you cant tell whether the entire spectrum is amplified or whether it is just the background.  You also cant tell how the signal strength compares to the detectors saturation limit.  That is another thing that plots of intensity versus pixel would let you evaluate.
