Ok We can do one thing, fb, google and GitHub provides us the email so we can save a random username like warren1 and password. For twitter, let's promt the user for the email that will decrease the barrier for comments and questions. We will directly have buttons on the /signup page for directly signing up through the providers. That will be in addition to what I have written in the proposal.  And the edit page will ALSO have links to link and unlink the providers so that they can add/remove more providers. Regarding the passwords randomly generated, we will notify the user to change their passwords on PL once they sign in through the provider via an email.
Does this makes sense??
