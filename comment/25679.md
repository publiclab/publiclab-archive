Hi Grace, Glad you are bringing attention to this issue! I was unaware of this until an attorney friend in ATL forwarded this story to me the other month. 
Some general questions: what other parties are or want to be collecting data (from Gov Agencies to community groups to lawyers)?

What sort of budget do you have? How much time do you have (ie does this need to be wrapped up by May?)?

Could you work with the emissions data you have and historical wind data which is freely available to reproduce this method: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10934529.2019.1657763?journalCode=lesa20 (the authors are v nice if you want to reach out to them) Whats nice about that is you can look at what the likely dispersal and exposure of your family and neighbors using already available data so you don't have to spend all of the money and time to conduct air sampling now as the company has a spotlight on it so they may be reducing their emissions now. 

I can't figure out what is up w/ the civil enforcement on this case
https://echo.epa.gov/enforcement-case-report?id=GA000A0000130670009300130

You can see some of their (likley BS-y) self reported ETO data here https://echo.epa.gov/air-pollutant-report?fid=110000355963 and on TRI

These are questions just to guide process :)
