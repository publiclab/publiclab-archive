There is so many test for this these are: Nitrate can be removed from drinking water by three methods: distillation, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange, and this can be removed by using [well grade concrete](https://cementconcrete.org/) , [well burnt brick](https://cementconcrete.org/structural/brick-masonry-construction/1996/),[ cement concrete](https://cementconcrete.org/construction-materials/cement/types-of-cement-properties-uses/1888/) structure for the well can decrease the well water pollution also.
