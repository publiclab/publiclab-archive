Since these pythons have been introduce to new areas of climate that are better than their own, they are now an endanger to down here in the south b/c they have a variety of meals they can choose from which one of them are US! They are replacing alligators! Due to them being able to live on land & on water. With all, they can thrive off us & our climates. Invasive species (Burmese Pythons) have been the cause of several animal extinctions.
