Double check me.  But, electric vehicles are more efficient than gas vehicles, even when electric plant efficiency is factored in.  

There are a number of other factors.  Electric plants have a peak efficiency.  Unless the motors  run at that speed all the time, the plant won't always be at peak efficiency.  That usually means nights are less efficient energy times than days.  Charging batteries in the evening would be a way to level out the demand and the efficiency.

Then there is solar energy.  It doesn't take coal. If that is used, you bypass the coal problem entirely.

Alternate energy is not my strongest area. This is from a class more years ago th a I like to admit.  Hopefully, it is still true.
