"Microplastics in The Drinking Water": by Dr. Scott Coffin
Environmental Science - Rene Phillips - 2nd Block

Dr. Scott Coffin has the responsibility of researching microplastic pollutants and providing information on their affects on humans. He pointed out in his presentation that we cannot be sure of all the chemicals entering our bodies from the plastics. This is because we have not yet developed technology to effectively evaluate nano plastics. He informs listeners that microplastics have proven to cause infertility in rats. While this is true it does not mean it applies to humans. Nano plastics have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and have also been found in the placenta. The reality of plastics pollution is severe and if not taken care of will multiply exponentially in a way that can be detrimental to our world.
