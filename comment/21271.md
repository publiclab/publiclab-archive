Both glucose and sucrose solutions are colourless so visible light is not going to work. A homemade spectrometer will not go very far into the UV , but will go up to about 950 nm in the IR - I'm not sure if either glucose or sucrose will absorb there.
The more obvious way to detect sugars is by optical rotation using a polarimeter. I think it should be faily easy to make a polarimeter though its accuracy may be limited.
