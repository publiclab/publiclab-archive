That's great work.  The videos are very well done and have a lot of info explained in a nice, straight forward manor.

I like the photo card.  Add a spot for the flow rate and always record the exact flow rate measured.  I know you spent a lot of time nudging the pump to the exact flow but it's not practical to expect users to do that. In practice most users will get it "close enough" so it's important to always record the actual measured values. If the sample goes long or the flow is a little off you can correct for that in your calculations provided you have the actual measured times and flow recorded.  Maybe a spreadsheet to crunch the numbers would be helpful too.

Also, if you have a fleet of equipment, it's good to put serial numbers on the equipment, like "Pump 10" and "Cylinder 2" then you record that on the card as well.  It's good quality control because eventually something will falter and you want to be able to identify the defective device.

I would also encourage field notes and observations when deployed.  What did the user see, smell, and hear?  Maybe it was raining outside or the carpet was new.  Did the place smell bad--what did it smell like??  If someone complaining about something then record their words verbatim.  

Looking for some forms to use as a guide, I found the NIOSH Guide for Building Air Quality, see http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/91-114/pdfs/91-114.pdf  Take a look at page 185 (pdf page 190), "Occupant Interview" and page 223 (pdf page 222), "Hypothesis Form."  Those might be a good start for field notes.

Also, I think taking three samples in the same location back-to-back is good practice.  I know it drives up cost but it quickly reveals the precision of your methods.
