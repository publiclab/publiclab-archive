Love it! We've been planning to release a minimal kite kit based on a keychain can but haven't run hard numbers or a test. A slightly higher end one could use the Mobius Action Cam but the [#16](/n/16) version of that keychain can (which the Mobius is based on) looks so great! And so cheap! Please post photos once you test!!
