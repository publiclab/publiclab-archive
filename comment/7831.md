Congrats Nicholas. That effort getting familiar with CHDK can greatly improve your aerial photos. Two notes on your procedure:

1. Your Powershot was released after 2010 so you can use an SD card larger than 4 GB and run CHDK from it. For older Powershots released in 2010 or before, SD cards larger than 4GB must be partitioned to auto-run CHDK as you do. This is not hard to do, and STICK will do it for you, but you must regularly switch partitions (make one or the other "partition 1") when copying photos to a computer vs.using the card in the camera.  It's not too intolerable, but it's something to consider (and in fact it can be pretty intolerable).
2. The buttons to push to enter CHDK mode differ from camera to camera. 

One CHDK feature that can dramatically improve aerial photos is shutter priority to keep shutter speed high. But your SX160 has built in Tv mode so you don't need CHDK for that (don't forget to use Tv!). The SX160 also has manual focus, which is another important aerial photo plus (set it to near infinity). The SX160 also has image stabilization which you probably want to turn off while flying, but experiments are warranted.
