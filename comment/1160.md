looks really nice and matte black -- but i've been thinking that the more rigid the case, the better -- the PVC spectrometer is mounted to a fairly stiff but still flexible vinyl-looking case, and the case still flexes easily, messing up the calibration. I wonder though -- if you cut the case open and lay the rigid extended flap against the phone, inside the case, maybe it'd be stable enough. I just don't want folks to have to adhere things to their phones directly if possible. I'll try a few different things... i bought some super-cheap pink phone cases on Amazon for $2 each, so i can make some mistakes :-)
