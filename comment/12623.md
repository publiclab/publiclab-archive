I did a check on the files I attached to the last comment and they are not as precise as I thought they would be.  

[![SSCFLalign.png](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/742/large/SSCFLalign.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/742/original/SSCFLalign.png)  
*A graph of the data file of intensity x calibrated wavelength (pink) overlain on the corrected diffraction pattern. Both data sources are from the Snowy Sky CFL spectrum.*

The reason for the imprecision is that the image of the diffraction pattern was corrected differently than the data series of emission peak intensities. The diffraction image was corrected manually in Photoshop by moving individual emission lines or groups of lines so they matched an overlay of the known emission lines of a CFL. So the lines in the image should be within a nm or two of where they should be. The data file is the result of applying a 3rd order polynomial correction (based on the same known emission line data) to the intensity series. This should also be accurate to within a nm or two. But the error for the two results is not necessarily in the same direction for any particular line, so there is a discrepancy of a nm or two for some lines. 

This is probably good enough for your current application, but be aware that these data sets have their limitations.
