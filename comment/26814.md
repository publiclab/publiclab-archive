thanks [@warren](/profile/warren), and [@liz](/profile/liz)! Looking at the image when I can see it brings up a question I posted earlier about not being able to control which layer in a [#mapknitter](/tag/mapknitter) stitched map is on top. I can't figure out how to use the keyboard shortcut you mentioned [@warren](/profile/warren) - could you explain?
Thank you!
