Thanks for this Scott, I am just working on a research note about the samples so you and Shannon can see some images: in shipping some of the labels came unstuck so there are four canisters that I can't identify. I'm posting some photos in the hope that you can Shannon have ideas about how we can positively ID the unknown canisters.
