Hi, folks - one more update -- I worked through the plan for the Map project, from Mridul's proposal, and put together a checklist-style plan in a github issue, with "phases" and really breaking things down into distinct steps as much as possible: 

https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location/issues/1

I'd like to ask each of you to do this in your respective projects, too -- it's a really great way to visualize your progress over the course of the summer, and a good first step to developing a [Milestone](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/milestones). Can each student start copying their tasks into a Github issue, and link to them from here? Thank you!!!
