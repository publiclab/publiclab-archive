Ah, thanks for the download tip. 

OK, that's really interesting to see that lower excitation wavelengths create more variable/distinct emission spectra. It does seem, though, that what Ethan had hypothesized -- that lowering excitation LED wavelength wouldn't get us less overlap -- isn't true, but that there are also other reasons why lower excitation wavelength is helpful besides overlap issues -- namely distinctness. 

[@ethanbass](/profile/ethanbass) -- i actually sent you one each of 385nm and 365nm LEDs, but I need to look up their specs for voltage, so don't try to plug them into anything yet. I'd love to see a neat and dilute spectrum of crude with 405, 385, and 365nm LEDs. 

Can you solder? I suspect we could solder the LEDs to a small board -- maybe even removing the 405nm one and swapping in the other, although it'd be a pain to have to switch back and forth.
