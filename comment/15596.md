I think a strength of public lab has always been that advanced work has been visible to new users. I also like how the activity grid organizes all of the work in a topic area in one place. When somebody new to the site logs on, they can see everything that's possible with the spectrometer, or the riffle, Etc., so I don't want to hide that at first glance. I would just concentrate on making the layout more clear with divisions and section headings, and maybe even allowing users to suggest new titles for activities, to help make those more readable.
