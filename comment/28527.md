Hi [@anirudhprabhakaran3](/profile/anirudhprabhakaran3) - thank you for your proposal! It would be great to see a little more discussion of how you hope to do these different tasks - perhaps some code snippets or sketches? What do you think will be difficult vs. easy, and why? And, can you anticipate some of the specific design or database-driven challenges you may face as you approach them? 

Thanks a lot!!!
