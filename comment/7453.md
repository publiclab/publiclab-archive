Oh, man -- Cindy Regalado and I converted a few of these with a group of students at the Waag Society about a month ago and they were a real pain! only 2 of 3 made it. 

Impressive documentation, thanks! I'd tell newbies to avoid this camera, to be honest, compared to the ease of an A495. I'm adding it to the camera conversion page too: http://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram-convertible-cameras#Acceptable
