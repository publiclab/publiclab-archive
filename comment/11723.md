Nice!  Yes, light intensity and phi2 are linked at the hip, and changes in light intensity will produced changes in phi2 on the millisecond timescale.  Also useful to know that Linear Electron Flow (LEF) = Phi2 * light_intensity * .4 .  The .4 is an assumption about the amount of light which is not absorbed into the leaf + the amount absorbed by photosystem I. 

So, given that, here is a typical relationship between Phi2 and light intensity:

You can see that phi2 (efficiency) drops off at high light intensity.  Your cloud data is a perfect example of this effect.  

The typical way to address this is to collect a wide range of light intensities on the same plant over the course the day.  In other words, instead of trying to compare everything at exactly the same light intensity (which is near impossible outside), we try to create the entire curve seen above for each sample.  This requires lots of measurements over many light intensities for the same sample population.  A great example of this is Jared's wheat project in Mexico - he took replicates of the same plot throughout the day, and ended up with a nice distribution of light intensities for each of his samples.

If you're interested in measurements which are more robust to changes in light conditions, SPAD (chlorophyll content) is probably the best - it changes over the course of days not milliseconds :)
