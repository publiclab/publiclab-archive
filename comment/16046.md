It would be possible to make a version of that device. It requires a digital projector which will be an expensive component (but maybe under $100). 

There are a few critical hurdles to making the device:

1. The live video (or recent still image) from the camera must be projected in near real time by the projector.
2. Both the camera and projector must be capable of focusing rather close (20-30 cm).
3. The camera and projector must be mounted solidly and close together so the image can be projected onto the exact scene that the camera records.
4. The infrared image will probably have to be altered to highlight the patterns of interest (e.g., veins). I am not sure how to do that without passing the image through a computer before it gets projected, but maybe some cameras or projectors have presets or controls for contrast or color balance that will enhance the patterns.
