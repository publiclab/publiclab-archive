We currently sell this pack: https://publiclab.myshopify.com/collections/spectrometry/products/acetate-slit-bundle

With 0.09mm, 0.12mm. 0.15mm, and 0.18mm slits. But we're not sure the exact reasoning behind these sizes except that they're 0.03mm apart. Would people like different sizes? Would people be upset if we simplified and started making only 0.1 and 0.2mm slits? 

What do you use these for and why?
