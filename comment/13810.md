Am interested in the qualitative analysis methodology which will be considered for the evaluation framework.  

If I may suggest something:  There is a very good resource available on the design of qualitative and quantitative measurement systems for impact investing(Development Finance Institutions) which PublicLab may find fits rather well in spite of the title of the book.  The methods used seem very applicalbe and the advice offered on design techneques certainly seem applicable.  The resource is as follows and can be downloaded without charge:

Evaluating the Impact of Development Projects  on Poverty
A Handbook for Practitioners
DIRECTIONS IN DEVELOPMENT
The World Bank
Washington, D.C.
Judy L. Baker
ISBN 0-8213-4697-0

Hope that might be helpful.... I would like to stress that the title of the book should not dissuade one from considering it's value for what I understand PublicLab is looking for based on what was posted by [#Shannon](/tag/Shannon).

As a side note, I have found that the software called NVivo is very helpful with qualitative analysis when the subject matter is text based, as it is with blog entries and other social media.  The tools available within the program speed the identification, categorization and analysis process enormously....
