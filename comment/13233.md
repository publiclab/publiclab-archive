That's excellent. Maybe a good order of magnitude cheaper than a FLIR camera.

There seems to be a typo in the description of the IR range covered in those two links. The first says "LWIR sensor, wavelength 8 to 14 Î¼m" and the second says "900 to 14,000 nanometers." I don't which is right, but I think only the second range covers both methane absorption bands?
