This suggests that UK balloons, like UK kites, must be kept under 60 m agl without special permission. There are similar restrictions in the US but they apply only to kites weighing over five pounds or balloons more than 6 feet in diameter. So we are quite free to use lots of kite line.

`2. REGULATORY BACKGROUND  

`2.1 Within UK airspace, the operation of balloons and kites are subject to the provisions
and requirements set out at Articles 163 and 164 of the UK Air Navigation Order
2009 (which is contained in CAP 393).  Amongst other things, these Articles provide 
that CAA permission is required to operate a tethered balloon or kite more than 60m
above ground level (agl)   

`3. Whilst proposals to operate a tethered balloon or kite
above the 60m threshold are considered on a case-by-case basis, associated
concerns are routinely very similar. Given potential difficulties associated with the
visual acquisition of cables, such concerns focus on the fact that a tethered balloon/kite operation cable as well as the balloon or kite could present a significant flight
safety hazard to other airspace users.
