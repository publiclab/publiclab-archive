Hi

I'm thinking of using an ESP32-CAM for airborne NDVI. This module has a 2M pixel camera, a 32-bit microcontroller and an SD card socket. It weighs less than 10g and is readily available for about $10   

It should be possible to remove the IR blocking filter and add an external red filter. Please does anybody have experience of using the ESP32-CAM for NDVI  monitoring applications?

Thanks. Mike.

Since posting the above I have been able to remove the IR blocking filter and add a red filter. Obtained some 'interesting' results using Infragram but need to more fully understand what each of the many OV2640 setting options does. Anybody know where I can find this documentation?
