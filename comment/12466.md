Just back from our recent fieldwork, and we've had great success with the DS18b20 temperature strings that we deployed back in March.

With all those joins, these are easily the most complicated build I have ever put underwater. And with waterproof DS18b20's being so inexpensive, the parts cost runs between $90-100 for these 20 sensor units. 
So I even managed to undercut low-end Thermochrons there. Woot!
