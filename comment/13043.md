[@Davidmack](/profile/Davidmack) all good thoughts, thanks for the detailed response. 

-The big challenge with intake thing is that, if I understand your approach correctly, the intake cannot be exposed directly to outdoor air in the winter because it will not give accurate readings if incoming air is less than 40 degrees. So that is why it is currently on the opposite side of the container, on the other side of the heating. I do like the exhaust suggestion- cutting a separate hole just to handle exhaust correctly.

-Really like the heater ideas, I don't have any experience really with the electric wiring stuff, but the pet store idea is a good one for an easy way to try it out.

-The summer/winter version is definitely a good idea, that is why I did everything with Velcro, so it could all be moved or taken out. Cooling fan should be an easy add.

-You are very right about the placard! I was thinking, since I am planning on doing this at an elementary school, that I could let one of the kids paint the outside with whatever design they wanted. Would make it more approachable/attractive for kids instead of a black box.
