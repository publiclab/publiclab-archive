On the net,  I've seen studies about using different material to filter air.  Based on my impression,  cotton is not an effective media to filter very small particulates like coronavirus.  Sorry I can't dig up my source of information. 

There are masks that are entirely made of clothes fabric, and manufacturers can only claim for dust removal and not protection from virus. 

On the other hand, if one cannot get hold of surgery masks, a fabric mask is better than nothing. 

 Heat can kill coronavirus.  Boiling a fabric mask is water for short while should not damage the mask.
