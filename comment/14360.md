Great topics in here! I wanted to invite you all to the (not yet publicly announced) upcoming May 2, 8pm, [OpenHour "hangout"](/wiki/openhour) on "Public Lab's research culture". It will include the themes/points that people have been discussing on the listserves and in the [wiki on research documentation](https://publiclab.org/wiki/research-documentation). Still wrangling the topic, but there seem to be three intertwined strands: refereeing information, documentation standards, collaborative process. How does this sound?
