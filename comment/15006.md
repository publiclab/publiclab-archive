OK, finally got some feedback, though not sure how helpful; 

I actually got stuck on installing softmodem itself; error here: https://gist.github.com/jywarren/c30643cd06f8c0c5c32a66e50f1da05a

It seems it's set up for timers on the ATMega 328 only, says this person? -- https://github.com/marcosdiez/arms22/issues/2#issuecomment-144633033

This is on the Nanite841: http://www.watterott.com/en/Wattuino-Nanite841 - https://github.com/cpldcpu/Nanite, which is ATTiny85-based. 

I actually got the "SoftSerial" library on this a long time ago, not SoftModem. I'm curious, does SoftSerial just do square wave 0s and 1s, instead of two-tone? https://codebender.cc/sketch:279140#Nanite841%20SoftSerial.ino

I can get a more conventional Arduino soon and try again, but looking for ATTiny softmodem, i find:

Thanks, Richard!
