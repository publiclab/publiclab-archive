Get her a lawyer.

Work on a nuisance claim. 

Document any health symptoms that could be related to the bad air.

Look for an document corrosion in metal piping to appliances outside of her home (exposed copper on air conditioner unit) that could react with Hydrogen Sulfide or other noxious chemicals

record everything in a log book.  emission events, health problems, dates air conditioners and air filters are replaced

white sheet test--put a white sheet outside for a week, photograph it for dust.

Save interior Air filters for air conditioning, label and date them.  these may come in handy later, if hte PM profile is ever identified, the air filters could show the same profile in Alice's home.

These are all things that can help an environmental case later.  the immediate problem is the nuisance of the plant. the plant is impacting Alice's quality of life, and the plant must remedy that if you can take it to a judge and she agrees.
