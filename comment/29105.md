Another answer to the original question from someone at 500 Women Scientists, with experience in microbiology: 

"I don’t know if there is a single catch-all answer but usual signs are things like significant drops in the dissolved oxygen concentration or if you know where an inlet is you might visibly see a significant change in the color or turbidity upstream vs downstream. Sometimes algal blooms are signs but that could be runoff from farmlands or other places with higher nutrients supplied to streams.

The slightly cheaper than a full lab-scale study but still kinda expensive would be to do some microbial community composition sequencing on a minion nanopore… it’s a kinda portable sequencing device and if you do something like 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and combine it with something like SourceTracker software it might pickup higher loads of influent/untreated wastewater…"
