 [@jainsubhahu](/profile/jainsubhahu) I'd be nice if we can maybe format the proposal (remove dangling underscores, bold appropriate headings, etc.) as well as add neccessary sections such as Timeline, Contributions, Passion and maybe some effective enhancements like [this one](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/4718#issuecomment-458366218)? Hope this makes sense and looking forward to help in any way possible!

Thanks!
