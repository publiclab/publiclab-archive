Chris, thank you very much for your detailed and prompt response. I now understand what I am supposed to do to get the NDVI image. Got held up with work and could not respond earlier. Apologize.

In terms of my cameras, I used this an auto IR-cut camera. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DNSSDGG/ref=ask_ql_qh_dp_hza

I disconnected the red and black wires as well. I think this would "remove"/dis-able the IR-cut filter though I am not sure how best to test this.

You mention that the consumer sensors are not very sensitive to NIR. Any cameras (within reasonable cost - say $100USD) that you would recommend to be used for this project.

I will explore adjusting the brightness of the two channels as well as doing some calibrations as my next step.

Thank you for your help. Reading your answer as well as questions on similar topics has been super helpful.
