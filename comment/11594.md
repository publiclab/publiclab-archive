Hi Nanfeng, 

I'm not certain why the results look the way they do but I have a feeling that it could be a result of doing pixel-by-pixel comparison. The JPEG image is degraded significantly through anti-aliasing and that would almost certainly give you some spurious results. Would it be possible for you compare a few small areas in which you calculate the average pixel value over an area with several (50 or more) pixels? If you could take a few relatively homogeneous areas to start with that represent light through dark patches in the image that would give you an idea if the results are better correlated.  For example you could take a sample on the white and black part of the bar, a rock , some vegetation like a bigger leaf.... You would need to figure out how to convert the Bayer image into individual bands without holes. In ImageJ/FIJI there is a plugin I use for that. You can use a nearest neighbor resampling or something like bilinear. I expect that for this test either would be fine. 
I'm traveling at the moment but will try to read this when I have a chance to see if you are making progress.
