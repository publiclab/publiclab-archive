Don and Craig, This is incredible progress. It's really reassuring that Craig is already doing affine registration. It boggles the mind that the necessary libraries might fit on an SD card and run on a Pi.  
I assume you have each camera plugged into its own USB port? What is the trick to synchronizing the shutters? Can you override or pregame the camera's autoexposure routine so it does not contribute to unequal shutter lag?  Would it be possible to connect the two cameras with a Y cable so one signal from a USB port went to both cameras?

Before your next hack session maybe you should tidy up that dresser a bit.
