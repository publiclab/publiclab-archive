While we were hacking away on this, I tried two landscape mounts for the camera.  

Adding a small ball head to the top was pretty successful:

This layout looks promising:

But while it photographs well, it won't hold nearly still enough to be used for photography.  The wood twists and it wiggles everywhere:

I think the basic idea is sound but it needs better right angle turns. l may revisit it with some cut wood panels instead of entirely cable clamp construction.
