Hi [@acuiles](/profile/acuiles)! We typically source lenses from Amscope, they usually have the best price, free and fast shipping! We typically work with 10 or 20x. Amscope also has a variety 4-pack that you could consider, and last time I checked it was slightly cheaper on Amazon.
Keep up the awesome work, we'd love to see what you create!
