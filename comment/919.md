I did see that post about the android version. Definitely exciting stuff. Using a Ras Pi is a lot more suited to my application though being a data logger. I have no idea how i am going to achieve it, but that is the aim :)

It is a shame about mmittler not sharing his work.

I think that developing the spectoral workbench for the ras pi will get it into a lot of hands though. I did start looking at the code for the spectoral workbench, but it is a bit beyond my abilities to understand at this stage. Still, there is a huge potential i think.
