Why do we need to discuss this problem in the first place and figure out a solution? This is an injustice within itself, thanks for this post [@warren](/profile/warren) 
if people lived by the Golden Rule, we wouldnt have to try and figure out a solution. But now we are relegated to compensate for a system (higher education) that supports profits and power over people (thats what it is!).  I know this is the sad truth, and I love your idea and what y'all did to restructure the power of data back to the community affected, but I cant help feel just a bit sad that this is the kind of world we live in.
