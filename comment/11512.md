thanks khufkens, interesting graph and really well presented.

On a qualitative level, you can see this by shining the red laser through a DVD grating and changing the incident angle slowly. At a certain incident angle, the addition side of the diffracted angle accelerates quickly off the screen while the subractive side (the side you have plotted) gets closer to orthogonal and at the point you have clearly identified, goes past orthogonal.

While the graphs show the non-linearity of the spectrum captured by the camera, it is important to see that the horizontal line in both graphs indicates the diffracted angle vs wavelength is actually close to linear. The spacing of the dashed lines at +20 degrees to -15 degrees is almost equal along the horizontal line, so the assumption that wavelength can be extrapolated accurately from diffraction angle (or position in image) is valid, as is borne out in practice. You have shown clearly that angling the grating to 65 degrees improves the linearity. At zero degrees of incidence, 380 to 480 nm is spread across 8 degrees, while 580 to 680, same 100nm range,  is spread across 20 degrees. That would make calibration of our spectroscopes quite difficult.

Just to be clear, the actual reason we angle the grating and camera and introduce an incident angle is so that the spectrum that is produced falls neatly onto the camera with the grating stuck to the lens. We could do it without an incident angle by separating the grating from the camera and moving the camera around in an arc behind the grating until we find the position of the spectrum. But this would push us (down) into a non linear region as shown on the graphs above. So really it is a win-win, something I hadn't thought about before.
