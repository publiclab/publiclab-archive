Microplastics are minuscule pieces of plastics that are under 5 mm in length that contaminate our water ways. There is also a variant called macroplastics which are plastics over the length of 5 mm. Microplastics affected all 4 spheres such as the hydrosphere, geosphere, biosphere, and the atmosphere. 14 million metric tons of microplastics sit on the ocean floor. Most of microplastics are found in plants and animals (about a 12/20 ratio.) The plastics are non-biodegradable which means they do not break down nor decompose.
