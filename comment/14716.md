- I kinda like the switch on the Riffle and now I know that it is something to pay more attention to. But I guess it adds much more complexity that one would expect it to.
- Registering two columns of timestamps is a straightforward coding exercise. A solution that works for most normal people (e.g., Excel) would be much appreciated. I plan to eliminate the problem with a GPS module so the Riffle can log lat, long, and alt with all the other sensor data.
- The BMP180 does not seem to have so much data scatter when it is sitting in the office so a housing for the BMP180 sensor is in order for subsequent flights:

- It might be too late to make Google Earth videos of flying around things. The current version of Google Earth does not seem to allow aiming the "camera" as you fly around. To make the video above, I had to use the recorded tour I made for LEAFFEST 2012 when we flew a kite at the same spot. So I can make a video of flying around anything I want as long as it is in that field at Breadloaf. The basic workflow for the GPS track video is [described here](http://kaptery.com/article/kap-gps/).
