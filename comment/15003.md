For an (unequally) attenuated signal, the amplitudes for f_low and f_high are uneven. In this case, the amplitude for f_high is very low.

Cool, I'm curious to see your test results! Arduinos output is 5V. According to wikipedia the [line level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_level)  for consumer products is 0.447V. But I don't know if this holds true in our case, as microphones usually create much lower voltages. However, I could observe the following voltages:

__Voltage  |  Components__

0.3V  |  SoftModem shield

0.2V  |  R1 1k, R2 2k, R3 5k

0.5V  |  R1 1k, R2 1k, R3 1k

I think up to 0.5V should not be a problem at all.
