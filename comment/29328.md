Dr Beck,

First off, thank you for your reply.

Let me take this one at a time.  What was impressive about this experiment?  I'm a retired R&D Chemist for a major pharm/Medical device company.  Many of the instruments routinely used cost $50k.  If you wanted, it was easy to spend over a million dollars for them.  So to see an instrument with similar capabilities for $30 is an acomplishment. As for spectral work bench, it is a good peice of software, as compared to much of the commercial software.  Not As many features, not as traceable as needed for many USP requirements, but very good for the price. As for telescopes, I have had very limited experience with scopes from some of the local clubs.  Spectroscopes?  Ok .  The lab had, and I routinely worked with, AA, microscope FTIR, EDXRF, UV/Vis, HPLC with DAD detector, HPLC with RI detector, GC/MS, NMR, as well as turbidity and nephelometry.  The company restricted what we could publish, but you will still find a couple of papers out there.    

Now, it's your turn.
