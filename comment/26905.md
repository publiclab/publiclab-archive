Hello silentsairam. 
1) SPS30 and BME280 are all on 1 single PCB enclosed in PVC piping with an inbuilt 12V fan. The fan's air rushes underneath the PCB (protecting all components from dust, while the SPS30 and BME280 are exposed to the air flow through holes in the PCB. Everything is made to be used outdoors.
2) Good point. The distance of government sensor is 2-3 Km from the nearest Breathe2 sensor. I know its too much, so theoretically there's no reason to compare. But we'v only got that kind of data so compare we must. In a sense, despite spatial and temporal unique variations between each sensors (including government) we see similar patterns after (running/boxcar) averaging  over 1 hour for days and days.

Hope this clears my original question, will air sample conditioning help?  Has anyone tried it.

Thanks.
