[@mimiss](/profile/mimiss) here is the link to the GitHub repository in which I will be sharing all current and future developments of this image processing project using drone-based UV imaging.
https://github.com/MuonRay/Ultraviolet_Image_Python_Processing_Codes

With continued support I plan to dedicate more time and effort to refine this technique in the field and focusing on its use for applications, especially for environmental monitoring. I have seen very interesting work in the observation of oil-slicks on water using UV imaging in the past and I want to extend this capability using drones in Gran Canaria's coastlines which are a good testing location. Indeed there are even some case studies of oil exploitation here which are worth a look on how they might be affecting the waters here.
