Just in case anyone on here is interested, I work for the Institute of Climate and Atmospheric Science at Leeds Uni. We actually have some of the Dylos instruments (googling about them is how I found this page) and we are hoping to have a summer student placement this year for someone to do some characterisation work on one to see how good they really are and if we can get anything better out of them. If anyone here is a current undergraduate student in the UK and is interested then feel free to check out http://www.nercdtp.leeds.ac.uk/research-experience-placements/. Please note that there are some eligibility conditions for applying though so please read carefully.
