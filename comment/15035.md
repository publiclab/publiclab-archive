Wow! Great and friendly presentation of the new system! 

I have some small comments, like that the icon by "Comments" should be `fa-comment` since the one shown generally means "share" not "comment" but overall this looks great. I think we can do some design work on the main /questions page, but actually I'm more interested in the short term in how the authoring interface will look, which I know is on your schedule to work on. 

Also, I know you've put some thought into how Qs and As will appear on peoples' profile pages. That'll also be very interesting. [@liz](/profile/liz) and [@stevie](/profile/stevie) -- what do you think about a tab called "Top answerers this week" or something... or more ways to explicitly prompt people to sign up to answer questions and share their expertise?

Eager to hear input from other folks too, of course!
