I only fly kites, and the kite is usually pulling really strong.  I also use a lot of line, always have at least 1km.  I have been thinking about using a spooler and I've seen some commercial offerings that even include shoulder and waist straps like a backpack, which would be awesome to have, but none that come with a big enough spool.  The other thing I've not seen is this small mechanism seen in fishing rods that moves the spool right and left to produce uniform winding along the spool, which in my experience is very important.

The technique I find most effective is where one person holds the line and another one walks away with a pulley, pulling the line to the surface, then grabs the line, walks back to the first person, and they repeat it until all the line is on the ground, and only then start winding it. (alternatively the person with the pulley stands in place and the other one walks away, or the both walk -- or run, if there's no tension on the line)
