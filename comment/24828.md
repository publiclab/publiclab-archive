Hello, thanks for that question! I think I should make some edits above to be more clear that box plots help us to identify *potential* outliers that would then need more rigorous testing before being thrown out.

This method does not use a t-test. What we're doing here is checking for a normal distribution pattern, and identifying values that are outside of that normal range, which we can classify as potential outliers. 

At this point in our analysis, we wouldn't want to use a t-test because it's answers a different question than the one we are asking. A t-test checks to see if two numbers (typically two averages) are different, so it's useful in a case like "is the test score higher after training in a manner that is statistically significant". Here, the question we would want to answer is "could this be an outlier". An outlier isn't necessarily something that is *different*, which a t-test would tell us, but something that is outside of the "population" that you want to study.
