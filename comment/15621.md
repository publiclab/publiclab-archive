Hi [@haribhimaraju](/profile/haribhimaraju) , it's great to hear from you! 

This is a really big question you have asked, with many smaller questions inside of it that themselves do not yet have answers. My short take on your overall post is that "point and shoot spectrometry" is not a reality in the DIY space at this time. To begin breaking the overall question down into some part that might be answerable, what is it about food that you are interested in?
