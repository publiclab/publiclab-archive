Hi, I think the enclosure could be a lot smaller, if you build on some of the other work folks have done on thermal fishing bob designs, for example, the 555-based analog design work, which'd be super tiny, or the Digispark based version I posted on [@kgrevera](/profile/kgrevera)'s post a while back:

http://publiclab.org/notes/kgrevera/07-06-2015/cape-cod-thermal-fishing-bob-field-test#c12101

A [TinyDuino](https://www.tiny-circuits.com/products/tiny-duino.html) could also run off a coin cell battery, making it even smaller. 

The original idea for the TFB was to have it fit inside an actual fishing bob:

That way, it can be cast from the shore and dragged back slowly for a thermal image. This also means that you need to be measuring only one temperature at a time, because the color indicates a single temperature at a single depth. This simplifies the design dramatically, making it much easier to construct. A single thermistor and a single RGB LED plugged into a DigiSpark or a TinyDuino has only 4 parts: 

* Small arduino ($9)
* Battery ($7)
* Thermistor (<$6)
* LED (<$4)

= <$26

Instead of adding complexity to the device, we could keep construction time and cost very low, and cover a large area quickly by casting it with a fishing rod. To measure at depth, you can put the thermistor deeper with a fishing weight, just like you'd do with a hook.

For a container, I think an old film capsule could work, since it'd seal nicely (you could use plenty of silicone glue or hot glue to seal the thermistor through a hole cut in the bottom) or you could go the [@donblair](/profile/donblair) route and [use a tiny Dasani water bottle](/wiki/riffle). Don's done a lot of work to get a good seal on a bottle cap, and is also working with thermistors.

Scratching the outside of the bottle with fine sandpaper would also help diffuse the light to make it easier to see. 

What do you think?
