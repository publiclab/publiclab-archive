Was checking one of the online vendors.  Found new centrifuges for $70.  Industrial quality centrifuge costs were much higher, but who knows.  If you are interested in making a hand powered centrifuge, try BioRxiv.  The article is titled "A 3D printed hand powered centrifuge for molecular biology".  It will handle up to about 2 ml of sample.  And for a review of this type of centrifuge see YouTube "Recreating Paperfuge: The hand powered centrifuge" by Qosmos Chen. With a normal cuvette, at least 2 ml is needed.  Even then, the cuvette will not be full.
