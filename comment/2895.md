The only relevant waste stream I know of is under my desk where several one inch squares of the stuff are somewhere.  I keep dropping them and little pieces are really hard to see.  The stuff I bought is here: http://www.scientificsonline.com/diffraction-grating-film-10010.html.  You get a lot more than you need, but it must be good for lots of things. You can also buy it in 2" x 2" slide mounts: http://www.scientificsonline.com/card-mounted-diffraction-viewers.html.  

Each kind of grating material diffracts light at different angles, so you have to experiment to set up your system at the right angle to get the spectrum centered in the camera image. The 3 degree change I made looks like it is not exactly correct, so more adjusting might be needed. But the iPhone camera is making very useful spectral images.
