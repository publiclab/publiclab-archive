I am not familiar with your white balance procedure so I don't know how it is affecting your results. If you can manually set the white balance, set it to exaggerate the brightness of the red channel (which will be used for NIR in NDVI computations).

Unless your plants are illuminated by sunlight or another source with sunlight's proportion of visible:NIR, you results will not look like traditional NDVI results. If a nearby window adds NIR light, it will also add even more visible light. If your illumination is dominated by fluorescent light (which has little NIR) your NDVI results will not be similar to traditional results.

The blue filter you are using blocks most red light, but some visible light will still be captured in the red channel. In the absence of NIR, when the red channel is used to represent NIR, the values will not be zero so NDVI will not compute to 1 or -1. 

The Fastie colormap assigns gray to all values less than 0.1. There is no gray in your NDVI results, so all of your NDVI values are higher than 0.1 (assuming the authentic Fastie colormap was used).

Many of the non-plant parts of your scene have higher NDVI values (e.g., red) than the foliage. This suggests you have much adjusting to do.
