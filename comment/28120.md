I really appreciated this post and especially the highlighting you've done of the transition between testing and other kinds of coding! I was surprised to see how smoothly it led us (i.e. you, lol) from bugfixing into architectural changes -- the unique id issue really inspired some system-wide architectural changes which then started accelerated many more fixes for other bugs. And now we're in this mode where we're thinking on the deeper state management issues!

Also, omg i love that giant bug -- an arthropod, no? I'd love a pet arthropod 😂 🐛
