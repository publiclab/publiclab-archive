beautiful! I'm in love with your hang-ups-- brilliant re-use of those springs.  

I'd love to see the camera mount inside, but I'm guessing that if its a copy of my rubber band rig that the camera is pulled up against the top of the recycling bin (with that piece of foam above it, and the rubber bands coming through two holes in the top.  is that correct?
