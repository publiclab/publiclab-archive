       Louisiana flood control levees have deprived coastal wetlands of the deposits it needs to survive. Without action, Louisiana stands to lose as much as 4,120 square miles in the next fifty years, along with the storm protection that such land provides to coastal communities and some of the nationâ€™s most economically important ports. There is a consequence to re-establishing the coastal march because it will mix freshwater and saltwater which will have an adverse impact on the seafood industry. This is an allogenic succession. The aquatic life like such fish as the Gulf killifish (male/female), Sheepshead minnow (female), Brown shrimp and white shrimp, Diamond killifish (male/female), the Mosquito fish (female), and the Oyster killifish are some of the species that was adversely affected by the re-establishment of the wetlands. By establishing new coastal wetlands and re-connecting the Mississippi River to its former floodplain, the state is currently attempting to reverse this tendency. But how will the state's coastal environment, which has made Louisiana second only to Alaska in domestic seafood output, be impacted by these freshly formed marshes and the rapid influx of freshwater to the coast? By examining how salinity affects species composition and food web dynamics in both natural and artificial wetlands, the research team hopes to find an answer to this question. Pond trap samples help the researchers determine species composition and food web dynamics in both natural and created marshes. The ultimate objective is to pinpoint the elements that foster a healthy environment and productive marsh creation initiatives. These data will be used by the team to create a model that forecasts how marsh food web structure, function, and resilience will be impacted by river diversions.
