Hi [@mercyorangi](/profile/mercyorangi)! You are doing an excellent work on the app! :)

I was trying it on my MOTO X (1st model), and realize that the pictures wasn't send to my e-mail... I believe I configured it correctly (by typing the e-mail adress), and the cellphone was on WiFi. Bellow you will find the screenshot.

Also, the camera isn't get focus. It does for the first shot, and only for that. On this way, if the kite/ballon flies up or down, the pics gets blured! =/

For last, the app is telling me that I am on LAT and LONG 0.0, but I'm not! Anothers apps can locate me correctly (around S22ยบ W043ยบ), so I don't think it's an internal problem... =/ (*update*: after some minutes using it, the Sky Cam located me)

many thanks for the app, and for the help! :)
