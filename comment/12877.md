Cool. You've got some really nice pictures of the cuvette frame assembly. For calibration, have you tried capturing the light reflected from a piece of white printer paper? I've gotten the best results using this technique. If you hold the printer paper right up the bulb (you could tape it to the lamp) and then hold the spectrometer close to the paper, you should be able to get a good spectrum.
