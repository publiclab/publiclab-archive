Hi [@ygzstc](/profile/ygzstc), i heard from Li Zhou and He Shan in Guangzhou who asked me to pass along a question about detecting "recycled" food oil, AKA used restaurant oil that is resold to consumers as new. They call it "gutter oil." Do we know anything about the usefulness of this technique for identifyingor  differentiating gutter oil from new oils?

FYI, at least one journalist has been killed in China for publishing about this issue. 
Pictures of the oil "recycling facilities":
