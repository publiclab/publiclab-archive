Hi Nick, I can put you in touch with folks Lisa Rasmussen who put together a Citizen Science Ethics conference where co-ownership and equitable partnerships was discussed a lot, and with Sacoby Wilson and Omega Wilson who have co-developed a proposed protocol for equitable project management. Those ideas would all be relevant for the start of a project though, rather than ameliorating this situation. It sounds like the either the researchers need to file an amendment with their IRB, or the community group needs to directly appeal to the IRB.
