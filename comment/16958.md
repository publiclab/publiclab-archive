[@shanlter](/profile/shanlter) i think that DFR EC will be better than what i use, at least after a brief look to the circuit.
i will order one, and try it as well, if they add to the store (or even in an unofficial way) the mighty isulator circuit :)


personal observation:
if you use arduino ADC, it's 10bit, from 0 to 1024. this on a 5V lead to a precision of
0,0048828125 -> 4mV

from code on dfrobot
1

    averageVoltage=AnalogAverage*(float)5000/1024;

2

    if(CoefficientVolatge<150)Serial.println("No solution!");   //25^C 1413us/cm<-->about 216mv  if the 

3

    if(CoefficientVolatge<=448)ECcurrent=6.84*CoefficientVolatge-64.32;   //1ms/cm<EC<=3ms/cm


so, with a 4mv of precision, results well... will sucks :D
i think that there will be more than 10% of error.

you can use a super cheap ads115 16 bit adc, i purchase it on aliexpress (and don't complain, living in china it's cool for this kind of things hehehe) for 2$ i think. 16bit will give you much better results.
you can also compensate VCC fluctuation, connect in A0 you power source (5v) in A1 the ec analog out, do a differential read, and use this one to do all the calcs. if A0 fluctuate (battery drain, power fluctuation) A1 will fluctuate too, differential should have minimum impact. i do that for ph, and it's pretty good

let me show you the GUI of my controller

as u can see, ph it's stable (with a 16bit adc)
salinity with the EC (and galvanically isolated on a different controller) it's still not good. i think that ec-mini-3 design can't lead to good results (salinity to ec formula ti's something like Nx0.66, so 36ppt should be 56ms/c). as you can see it swing of 2ppt lower (unlikely, in a reef aquarium it's a stable parameters, evaporation should RAISE it, not LOWER it obviusly)
