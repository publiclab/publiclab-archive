Thanks [@xose](/profile/xose) for your input! I've little to no experience with this sort of hacking and am still quite confused with a closing window to order the stuff needed...

So the Zero W draws ~210mAh meaning we'd need 5040mA each day. Adafruit's [largest LiPo battery](https://www.adafruit.com/product/353) is 6000mA. 

Adafruit also has LiPo boards but they don't seem to be designed for Solar like the Lipo Rider Pro.
If getting the Zero2Go-Omini board would we have to get a charger board as well? I'm afraid of getting more than I need or to miss something as prices vary wildly (e.g. [Pi-UptimeUPS for 50USD](https://www.amazon.com/PI-UPTIMEUPS-Uptime-UPS-Raspberry-Trade/dp/B072WKCQCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pl_foot_top?ie=UTF8) vs [generic TP4056 5pcs for 6USD](https://www.amazon.com/XCSOURCE-Lithium-Battery-Charger-TE420/dp/B01DRT4PWY/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1542354587&sr=8-4&keywords=TP4056)). There's also a [smaller one](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Battery-Regulated-Bi-Directional-Support/dp/B07HB28PZZ/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1542355694&sr=1-3&keywords=pi+zero+lithium&dpID=41OHt2cnAgL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch). /me confused! Thanks for your guidance!
