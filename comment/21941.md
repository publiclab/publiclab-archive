Subtracting the blue channel from the red channel is a good first step for correcting for contamination of the red channel with NIR. With one particular camera that has been characterized for NIR and red sensitivity, it seems that subtracting twice the blue channel from the red channel is appropriate (see thread: 
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/plots-infrared/aJhM30D6bUM/ZYuNm7gAHQAJ;context-place=forum/plots-infrared). You might have an even better way to make this correction because you did the clever observation with two filters.

However, you might be missing some steps. The red and blue channels must also be corrected because the sensor is less sensitive to NIR than it is to red, and because what the camera measures (brightness) is not identical to what you want to know (radiance). This is what the calibration curve is for. To make the calibration curve, you need to know how the proportion of red to NIR in the RAW data differs from the actual proportion of red to NIR radiance in the light travelling from the subject (a leaf) to the camera. That is what the calibration targets are for.

To use calibration targets, you must know how much of the incoming NIR energy is reflected from them compared to how much of the incoming red energy is reflected. A spectrometer can tell you that. Good commercial calibration targets reflect the same proportion of the incoming NIR and red wavelengths (and all other wavelengths). But colored tiles probably do  not. So until you measure the spectral reflectance of your tiles, you can't use your tables above to adjust the values in any meaningful way.

For example, in Table 3, the red channel values for the tiles are very similar between Image 2 (NIR) and Image 3 (red). Let's assume your filters were perfect and that the values for Image 2 and Image 3 were identical. Two variables determine how much red and NIR were coming from the tiles to the camera: How much red and NIR was in the light shining on the tiles, and how much of each was reflected from the tiles. Sunlight generally has less NIR than red, but you don't yet know about how much of each is reflected from the tiles.

But this is all getting a bit confusing for me.
