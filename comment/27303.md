Hi Sam

Did you try interning numbers into the 'red' box on instagram? Some half convincing NDVI looking effects were achieved by doing this but I would feel more confident knowing how it worked. Please let me know if you do find a comprehensive 'User Guide'.

I have been developing a low weight/power camera to take NDVI images from onboard a small 'party' foil balloon. Its based on the ESP32-CAM microcontroller board that cost less than 10$ including the camera and SD card socket. 

I removed the IR blocking filter from the lens barrel and added an external red filter. There are many Arduino examples of how to program the board for automatically taking images or being triggered externally (e.g. from a PIR).

Regards, Mike.
