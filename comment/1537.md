I thought the film I used was developed unexposed negative film but am not certain. I got the film from Jeff Warren so maybe he can clarify. There was a recent post comparing different film types for NIR filters: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cindyexcites/9-20-2012/infrared-camera-test-film-types. It would be great to test different filter material.
