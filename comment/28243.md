Here's a good "getting started" activity you can do! https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/03-22-2017/how-to-visually-document-a-site

It can also be great to do a mapping if you're just getting started. That way you can see your site from above and help to think about things in a new way https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/04-26-2019/how-to-decide-on-a-tool-for-mapping
