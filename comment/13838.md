You are correct, it is difficult to keep the hardware parameters the same everytime, I was checking out your prototype spectrometer and the design is spot on, although the board camera that you are using, the only specs I can find are just dimensional, MP and FOV info, I've searched until the cows came home and found some 5mp board cameras but specs are few and the ones that have them you have to get them custom manufactured for an arm and a leg.
