Uh, perhaps I am not fully understanding on my initial readthrough, but since we have a big need to characterize sensitivity in the webcams we use in our spectrometers on Spectral Workbench (for exposure calibration), could we use an exposure-calibrated spectrometer to characterize the webcam in a non-exposure-calibrated spectrometer?
