Mr Warren, it looks shorter but seems to fit a M12  lens thread.   You would have to measure the hole spacing (21mm) to determine if it's compatible with a PI v2 camera.   

FYI, m12lenses offers mounts for most hole spacings.   You may be able to match what you have against their catalog.

I assume m12 lens can be adapted to either webcam or raspberry pi camera  as long as the right camera mount is selected.  Mount designs seem to be based on hole spacing and being able  to fit around the electronics.
