Hi, GreenLeaves - sorry, we were talking about the camera settings, not the Infragram.org stuff. I'm actually traveling so I apologize for not responding faster to your inquiries. 

I tried uploading your photo (above) to Infragram.org, and you're right that it does not seem to differentiate plants well. What kind of camera is it? This is what I got with the "basic" colorized preset for blue filters:

I am still traveling until Sunday so please forgive if I am unable to respond quickly. My suspicion is that you may be using a CMOS camera which may work better with red filters, if you read some of [cfastie's](/profile/cfastie) recent work on the subject. We are thinking of completely switching to red filters in upcoming versions of the kit.
