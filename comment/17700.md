I left a long response to this with a possible initial solution:

Cool, thanks Liz! 

To try for one stab at a narrower feature towards this goal, what if tag pages (floating new name: *topic pages*...!?!) had a list of "Related topics", something like:

> **Related topics:** `water` `runoff` `wetlands` `turbidity`

Where "related" means that (acknowledging that there are different ways to measure this, and that we want some "computationally efficient" way) these are the tags which most commonly appear on pages that already have the primary tag. So for the topic `onions`, we tally every page tagged with `onions` and take the top, say, five most commonly occurring tags

Small follow-up if the above sounds good -- would it be all right to do this solely for the most recent 20-30 pages? Even if this is just a starting point, that would make this easier to implement without worrying about it causing overall website slowness. There could be more complex ways around this, but this is the easiest way to get started.
