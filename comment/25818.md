Progress with the LED light sensor technique revealed that you can can also measure temperature by timing the reverse-bias charge decay on ANY type of diode. This makes high resolution readings possible without the op-amp you often see used with diode-methods that measure forward voltage deltas. So we are currently trying to decide between thermistors vs diodes for ambient temperature sensing. As a bonus, the two devices are close enough that I can even use the Steinhart & Hart calculations over a range of about 30C, so changes to the base code are minimal:

If you use the D8&D7, a 1n1418 is so small you can hang it right off the pin headers in a tight build.
