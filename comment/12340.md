Hallo Jose.
It is indeed a ELP camera. I had one laying around here.
 jewelry spectroscope I bought form aliexpress. But you can find them anywhere.

Only modification I did was to file away some metal where the light exit the spectroscope. For my camera the exit lens whas to deep in the housing. The eyepiece is aluminum, is easy to file.

When you have some images with the AR0130 let me know.

I also had an crazy idea to put a linear cmos sensor behind it.
