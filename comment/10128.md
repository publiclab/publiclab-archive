Hello Chris!
Answering your question 

> What is the "A" in RGBA?

Alpha. For this application, it probably does not make any difference whether I pass-through alpha component, as the original JPEG is just "RGB" 

> You said you applied the color map to the image, but did you also compute NDVI for each pixel? Or apply a color map to the original photo?

Color map to just "B" component of the original photo. After reading your comment, I have realized that I might have processed much of the visible light component went through the B filter. I have added further experiment of subtract visible right component ("R") from "B" which seems to be producing consistent result from supposedly "processed" image provided as an example. (I will post comparison to that later.)

> Does the blending in the third step explain why the color in the sky is not a color in the color gradient you used?

Yes, it's probably for the fact, as I said above, the process also processed visible light went through "B" channel. 

The last example seems to indicate that it's no longer affecting components such as color in the Sky.

I will be certainly experimenting more to produce more "prettier" presentation of the output.

Another great thing about Blender is that additional processing can be defined in Python, which may provide added functionality to process this image in a way it's more useful.
