[@warren](/profile/warren) Since the deadline is almost approaching and I'm quite busy this week...:( I don't think I can have time to write down any codes within deadline... While I'll draw an UI graph to give more detail about how VUEJS and state-machine works. I'll also include my old project link later for showing my experience with VueJS and State-machine(That one is actually a private one but I might can dig them out for a while...) Thank you for advice!
