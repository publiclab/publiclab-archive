You might find this thread helpful; it lists open-source packages and code for "cleaning" environmental time series data: https://twitter.com/amalia_handler/status/1151598449063682049  One would have to have some skill with coding to use those, though.  I know some of the people in the thread, including the StreamPulse folks at Duke (your profile says you're in Durham, in case you personally want to talk to them directly); I could ask them to weigh in if that would be helpful.  I get that ultimately all the info is supposed to go on this site; I just don't know that much about this topic personally, and am new here.
