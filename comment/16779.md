[@xose](/profile/xose), just a note about this great question that was posted over the weekend -- i'd love to hear more about your [#raspberry-pi](/tag/raspberry-pi) trail camera -- esp. because of how cheap it could be!

I've been thinking about how it could make it significantly easier to offer an SD card image pre-loaded -- so you could just plug it into a raspberry pi, attach to a USB battery, and glue into a box. Then we could get more people prototyping the enclosure, the placement, the power issues, and there'd be less struggling over the basic installation (i just spent much of Sunday trying to get a Raspberry Pi set up).
