Very cool, nate! Thought you might like some earlier and probably less successful experiments:

Especially do not do what's shown in this last video. Even with the car in reverse it's not a great idea.

Also, would you like the image to be the "lead" image for your research note? I'm an admin and am happy to make the change. But you can also do so, just upload your image to the "main image" field instead of the gallery. Then it'll show up larger and generate thumbnails.
