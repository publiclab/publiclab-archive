 Thank you; I now have a meter that seems to work OK. I gave up on the paper version, though – it was just too wobbly. I used wood, instead, to get some rigidity.

But after getting a few photos that look good enough, I'm stuck with calibration. There is a video here about Spectral  Workbench, but I find it impossible to follow. There is a lot of Uh's and Ah's, say. I mean, there does not seem to be a script.

Note that I'm a total newbie as regards spectrometry. Is there a written how-to anywhere?
