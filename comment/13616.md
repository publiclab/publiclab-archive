Rayishido,

I assume the orangish photo was taken with the PiNoir camera with a blue filter. By calibration I think you mean you used the AWB_gains feature to adjust the automatic white balance. The photo has very good separation of the red and blue channels. The green channel is not so important. The NDVI values computed from the photo are very much in the proper range. The plant health information in the photo is compromised because the foliage is backlit or in the shade. This is from Fiji:

What kind of tree is that in the center of the photo?
