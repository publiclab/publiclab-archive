[@liz](/profile/liz) It looks like The Things Network is a citizen led initiative to use the new LoRa protocol which sounds promising, I've heard some buzz around it recently. [@donblair](/profile/donblair) LoRa is probably worth looking into. Here's a [post about the capabilities](https://www.cooking-hacks.com/documentation/tutorials/extreme-range-lora-sx1272-module-shield-arduino-raspberry-pi-intel-galileo/), here are some [LoRa based modules/kits/etc. from Cooking Hacks AKA Libelium](https://www.cooking-hacks.com/shop/wireless/extreme-range-lora)

[@donblair](/profile/donblair) I originally thought the range was around there but turns out not. The range listed on the TI SensorTag is [50m](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/?INTC=SensorTag&HQS=sensortag) and I can verify it after testing it with the Open Pipe Kit driver I wrote for it that was communicating through a Bluetooth USB on a Rasberry Pi.

[@warren](/profile/warren) At least it's cheaper than that WiFi module :)

> WIFI tends to be on the 'high power' side for WIFI

[@donblair](/profile/donblair) My hunch is also that it's on the higher side but it is influenced greatly by how wifi is typically used. The battery lifetime on the TI SensorTag for BLE, 6LowPAN, and ZigBee is 1 year at a 1 second report interval. They have a WiFi version of the SensorTag coming soon, I'm looking forward to what the battery lifetime will be on that option.
