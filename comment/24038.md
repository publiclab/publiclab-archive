For calibrating the Raspberry PInoIR camera I wrote a gui application to just play around with till I found a good result.
I looked for values that would look as close to a RGB picture as possible but depending on the filter used some colors would look of. The code can be found at https://github.com/PiddePannkauga/PiCameraGui. Run it on the raspberry pi.
The image I have provided shows a good calibration in my opinion. This is using a blue filter that came with the PInoIR. The red gain for white balance is higher than the blue gain. All setups require different calibrations depending on how much light is present when capturing an image.
