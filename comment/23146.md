Hi Warren,

Try as I might I can not seem to get the light coming through the inlet to provide a spectra.  I've tried all orientation of the grating on the lens, and also different orientation on the 65 degree slant piece.

I can get the lens to produce a spectra, but that is off of light from random angels, when I expose it to open light.  I noticed, for example, I can block the light from direct line to the lens, and get a spectra from the light coming from another angle, which I can block.  I attempted to recreate this orientation within the spectrometer, but not solid luck.

How forgiving are the dimensions within the spectrometer?  For example, I don't know if I should fret about the vertical location of the camera, or the exact distance from the slit.  Of course, you have to be within the ballpark, but not sure how big the ballpark is.  I imitated the image provided above for placing the camera on the block.

on the posted image you an see a spectra, but this is taken by blocking the direct line into the camera, thus the dark background, and then the spectra seems to be coming from a 90 degree, well, at least some other angle direction, which I can also seem to block. (see next post)
