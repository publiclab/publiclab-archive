Matthew I'm a bit baffled by your reply to my previous comment. You picked the Sanm Tech specifically because exposure control was implemented ....... exposure control is rarely, if ever implemented in any USB software packages. So if its not implmented how is it of use?

I'm not trying to be sarcastic I'm genuinely baffled. Guvcview (and various other Linux utils I tried) does show exposure and gain controls for my Logitech cameras but not for the Sanm Tech. I see the FAQ page seems to say something about control via browser, I'll investigate.
