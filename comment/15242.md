[@warren](/profile/warren), I think it could be useful -- it could be more visually appealing than just having a Table of Contents at the top and then straight text following. It also would be a pretty awesome feature for a quick sort of guide that wasn't interactive. Like, if the CSAP were only informational, and you could un-collapse information that was relevant to you but skip over sections that wouldn't be relevant to you. What do you think?
