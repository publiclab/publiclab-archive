Hi [@molangmuir10](/profile/molangmuir10) - thanks for all this, we're addressing some immediately, while other suggestions we are incorporating into our planning for future releases. Super helpful. 

Re: offline, it's a really good suggestion. Actually a lot of the basic UI of MapKnitter would work offline. The biggest challenge at this point is the ability to export the whole combined map as a single image. I think it's possible to do offline but the bigger the map, the greater the challenge. Can you tell us a bit more about what would be good interim solutions, such as, would it be useful to be able to download individual distorted images even if the "combined map" isn't available in "offline mode"? 

Would an SVG image (or even a PDF) of the combined images work, because for various reasons it'd be easier to generate then a combined JPG? 

Thanks!!!
