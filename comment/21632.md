Welcome back Edie and Happy New Year! and, wow, thank you for all this work! It's so great to see this dashboard mockup come to life! I just studied it for a while, and read the comments, and would like to add my +1 to each of the points that Jeff wrote out in comment [#21625](/n/21625) above. 

I'm wondering if the center activity column that features topics is getting redundant with the longer list of topics on the left side. Keep in mind that the list of ~20 topics is itself excerpted from https://publiclab.org/tags, and then "Trending Topics" is an even shorter excerpt. Do you have any better ideas to not have redundant summarizing of topic areas? Thank you!
