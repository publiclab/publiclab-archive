I echo Chris's comments with two additions:

1. we could perhaps improve the calibration by having the interface "snap" to the nearest peak when you click, and if it's a good assumption, find the center of any overexposed "plateau", as in this issue: https://github.com/jywarren/spectral-workbench/issues/85

2. Chris and I just chatted and came up with the idea that we could click on outliers in the tag graph, to then leave comments and help people fix their calibrations: https://github.com/jywarren/spectral-workbench/issues/166
