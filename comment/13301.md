The entrance slit should be parallel to the grating lines. I don't recall that anyone found that spectral quality is improved with one side or the other of the DVD toward the slit. I think the shape of the diffraction pattern changes some depending on how the DVD piece is rotated (lines concave up vs down). You should see the diffraction pattern with your eye close to the grating.
