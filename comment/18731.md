On important thing to note in Twitter API is that we cannot get replies to a Tweet directly ! 

So the alternative is to fetch recent replies to  [@PublicLab](/profile/PublicLab) on twitter and then follow the above flowchart in the proposal . 
[@warren](/profile/warren) kindly see the demo in the proposal and let me know if anything need to be changed or modified . 




Thanks !
