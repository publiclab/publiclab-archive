I did not think about measuring the AC duty cycle.  I think the most influential observation was the front door being open 8 to 10 inches.  By the way, the plant was not moved over the kitchen sink.  It is across the room from the kitchen.  Facing the kitchen from the living room it is on the right side of the trailer.
