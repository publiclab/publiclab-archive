Biodiversity is important because it is essential for the processes that support all life on Earth, including humans. Biodiversity also includes the evolutionary process and adaptation of changing environments of species. The more diversity the stronger and more successful an ecosystem is. but sometimes we are the reason that some are not successful like the blue fish tuna. The population went down by 95%.
