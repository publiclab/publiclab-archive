Thanks all for your input!

Good idea on movement from note => wiki -- and on authorship metadata. We should also do more generally to make wiki authorship apparent. 

Side note: I was browsing the Ruby on Rails guides, and saw this at the bottom:

> Feedback: You're encouraged to help improve the quality of this guide.

Made me think we could consider having a permanent prompt at the top or bottom of all wiki pages, inviting people to fix/add/refine. Of course this'd be easier with more in-line editing options, and a suggestion feature, etc. But good to keep in mind.
