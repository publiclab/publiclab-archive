 The [#simple-air-sensor](/tag/simple-air-sensor) is supposed to show red-yellow-green, but I've seen them turn white when malfunctioning. Try unplugging it and plug it back in, and try a different power source. If it still doesn't work, can you upload a good photo of it so we can be sure it hasn't gotten unplugged or anything? Worst case you can send it back to us and we can send a replacement. Thanks!

There's a longer discussion about assigning colors to different levels here: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/04-18-2019/brainstorm-on-ways-to-use-colored-light-to-show-sensor-readings
