Hi [@read_holman](/profile/read_holman) -- I might have mentioned the [Newtown Creek Conservancy](http://www.newtowncreekalliance.org/) and the [North Brooklyn Boat Club](https://northbrooklynboatclub.org/education/) (there is a lot of overlap between the two organizations). They've been involved with a lot of colleges, schools, organizations, etc over the years with different water quality monitoring. I can put you in touch with one of the people I know there.
