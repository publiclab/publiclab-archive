Yeah, I think I could do it. Hmh, I must admit that I only pretty recently started to use Excel-like programs at all. To be honest, your research notes impressed me and inspired me to find out more about nature in those CSV file numbers. Hey, I am learning more about webcams recently than I have ever thought I could. A webcam was just some "light sensor square" to me until I started to think about those things and talk about them with you and others here. The first layer of knowledge is the patterns I can derive via spectroscopy and some "crude" statistics. And I feel there is an even deeper layer of knowledge worthwile to be explored ("classical" electron particle level) and behind that another (quantum level)... Why is there noise at all? How is it generated in detail? What do the electrons want to tell us...?  ;-)  Isn't it great that we can research such things at home and talk about them with fellow researchers over the internet? Aristotle and Demokrit would become green out of envy...
