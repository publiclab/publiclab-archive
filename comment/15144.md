I agree with Jeff that those results seem to suggest that whatever full spectrum source is used the same general spectral response is found (more brightness in the middle of the spectral range), and that a good explanation is that the detector is more sensitive in the middle of the range. 
There are some other really interesting patterns in those data, but apparently one cannot put images in comments on questions, so I can't share them here.
