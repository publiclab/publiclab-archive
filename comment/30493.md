The Burmese Python being an non native species to the Florida everglades has had many impacts all of which being negative. The main impact of the Burmese Python on the Florida everglades is the constant destruction of the local native ecosystem it has the potential to make the American Alligator extinct which was the apex predator before the Burmese Python was non naturally introduced to the ecosystem. This is a major issue because it has a sorta butterfly effect which could make many other negative impacts on the ecosystem this is because the introduction of the Burmese Python has disrupted the natural order of the Florida everglades. 
Thanks to Public Lab I have been able to learn and share the knowledge of the very important study of Environmental Science which is greatly appreciated.
