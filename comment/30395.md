The effect of the clean water act to camp Lejeune has led to many lawsuits and a lot of its inhabitants to be compensated including Family members. Most of the people that lived in the base including family members are deemed exposed to carcinogenic chemicals one of which is Benzene. The clean water act of 1972 allows the family of the soldiers to get compensation. Almost 1 million soldiers are deemed affected by these chemicals at camp Lejeune. The clean water act of 1972 enforces consequences to those who neglect water safety for the people so that it could prevent future contamination.
