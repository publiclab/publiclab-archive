Yeah it was big seminar more than 100 people from different universities joined it.
They asked many questions about public lab. Many of them were answered by us. They asked to explain what technology stack and repositories public lab has. In which repository which tech stack is used. They asked about mapknitters, plots2 etc. They were interested to know about the community. Who are involved in it? Who is admin? Who are mentors? Their work... What we really build at public lab? Etc...

These all were answered by us. Mainly questions were about how to start contributing to public labs.
