Yes that's right, one person did talk about using Vue. But at that time Image Sequencer was in its initial stages and functionality had to be preferred over UI. It can be used no doubt it would be a very good choice! But that's what I was saying earlier, you should decide a scope - on one hand you're talking about using Vue (UI) and on the other GPU and RESTful API (functionality, architecture). You can definitely work on multiple things but since GSoC is just 3 months long, it's better to have a focus on a couple of these and not all!

Thanks for the very kind words, [@warren](/profile/warren) !! It wouldn't have been possible without you and the positive culture PublicLab has! I still sometimes think about what I could do better back then :-)
