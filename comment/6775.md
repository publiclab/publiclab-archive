Hi Scott -- it looks like the samples are too dense for light to pass through... ideally the source light (laser or UV) goes all the way through the sample without reflecting off anything (or minimally). I think this may be happening because the coal is not a solution, and something similar happened at the Gowanus Canal. 

Is there any way to dissolve the coal? Or maybe filter out the sediment with a coffee filter or something to try to collect and concentrate the soluable parts of the sample? We may find that very little dissolves.
