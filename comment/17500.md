Hi Zengirl. We missed you bigly. Turns out Katie's a rock hound. Who knew? (no, Public Lab, this is not a question). She went all in on the geology. Now every year we have to do a mushroom hunt AND a geology tour. Pretty soon there will be no time at all for kites.

There are garnets somewhere in these hills. Garnets are the Vermont state gemstone. The best ones come from Mount Belvidere where all the serpentine is. So maybe there are some at Vermont Verde Antique. We'll have to find out next year.
