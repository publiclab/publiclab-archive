I finally went through the ubiq show from Italian TV for screen caps. I also made a PL-specific cut of the episode. You all were named or were recognizable to me in the video while I was cutting it.

I called my version the "ritalin cut" because it's far less ADHD than the original episode linked above. I probably can't share my cut what with copyright and all that. Unsure if Italian copyrights apply to the USA, but they probably do.
