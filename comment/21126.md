I love the Problem section -- so true!! ðŸ˜‚

Great idea to do a few different mockups before starting -- getting input on these may save us time later if we ask the key stakeholders what they think!

Nice thought on 2 parallel sub-projects to avoid getting stuck on one!

I also just wanted to say it's been really great to see how you've been so friendly, communicative, and collaborative with others around the project. You may have noticed it's a busy time with Google Code-In starting up, and we love it when folks appreciate and adopt the welcoming spirit of our community. Thanks a lot!
