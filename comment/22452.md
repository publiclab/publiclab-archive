Matthew: Please look again at the "Current Mine Information" you posted with your question. It has "Opr. Begin Date" of 6/1/2013 for Hoffman Construction Company and Great Northern Sand as operator begins on 5/3/2012 and ends on 5/31/2013. So the site changed operators with Hoffman Construction seemingly still operating;( maybe not as a mine?) Also, the Wisconsin DNR data for PM10 monitoring, http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Mines/AQSandMap.html, shows monitoring data for Great Northern from 10/26/14 through 12/26/16 without a note stating that "sampling ended" as it has for some other sites. So, the situation is not as straight forward as it might have seemed at first sight. In addition, around here, "wildlife area" often indicates marginal land that is marshy and/or overgrown and left for hunting and trapping. If the winter had much snow, spring could be very muddy and/or wet and there are often a lot of brambles.
