Hi Chris!  Thanks for the kind words. We are indeed working with a manufacturing partner for CATTFish (formerly WaterBot), but I don't know exact costs yet. For Speck (formerly AirBot), we're not quite as far along, still considering various options. The $50-$100 numbers in the Engadget article seem low for commercial product prices, at least for a first run--I imagine those numbers were for BOM and/or production in high quantities (tens of thousands).
