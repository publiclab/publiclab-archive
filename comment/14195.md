Hi, Dave - i'd love to work with you to design an experiment for comparison of 405nm laser, 405nm LED, and maybe 385nm and 365nm LEDs, with a known simple fluorescence test. Would you be interested in doing that? We could do everything exactly as done in the OTK beta tests, with mineral oil and acrylic cuvettes, but change only the light source. That way we'd only change one variable at a time. Interested? I could send you the LEDs then.
