Hi - For Fiji installation instruction you should look at the Fiji website: http://fiji.sc/Fiji
Keep in mind that you will need to install an older version of Fiji since there are some issues with the most recent version. I suggest you use the version "Fiji Life-Line version, 2014 November 25" that can be downloaded from the page I noted above. Later today I hope to add complete packages of Fiji/ImageJ/Photomonitoring plugin to the GitHub site. When that is completed I'll write a research note to announce the change.
