That sounds like a very interesting project! Have you submitted a research note for it?  I for one would definitely be interested in exploring DIY quads and grassroots mapping in more detail.  
   There is certainly a wealth of online documentation on sites like diydrones.org etc... but I can't think of anything specific to diy mapping.  I'd also like to look deeper into the long term cost benefits of balloon mapping (balloons, helium rentals etc...) vs the upfront cost of an open source quad build like MultiWii or Arducopter.  I wonder if there are certain scenarios where an upfront cost of $300-$500 makes more sense than renting a helium tank every time.  It would also be interesting to see if there are situations where forest cover/other obstacles prevent tethered flights like those of a balloon or kite but might be possible with a quadrotor.
  It would also open up more possibilities for real-time capture as "FPV" telemetry modules are getting more and more popular in the RC community.  Such capabilities are much more challenging for unpowered flight as it would require a dedicated power source and would add significant weight.
   Concerning your goal for collecting georeferenced orthophotos. I wonder how difficult it would be to preprogram that functionality into a flight plotter like MultiWii? I could picture a format wherein one draws an outline of the area they want to map, and the program would plot its own path according to the focal length of the camera and other factors that affecting accuracy.  You might not even need a gimbal in such a case as there would ideally only be one angle of view and that could be adjusted through the quads own gyro/accelerometer.  I've never worked with Arducopter but MultiWii is Arduino-based and relatively easy to customize once you figure out the configuration files.
