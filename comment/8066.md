Its more that the Sparkfun Board presents a roadmap of sorts for integrating the Melexis Sensor directly into the flashlight board.  Since the Virtualight is already based on the 32u4 any modification would be more akin to using the Virtualight as the basis for a redesign of the Sparkfun Board.  This is of course assuming that the Sparkfun Board configuration could successfully be upgraded to use the 32u4 chip and/or there isn't already a simpler method for interfacing the Melexis sensor to the Virtualight.
As I mentioned earlier though, even without thermal sensory support, it might be interesting to look into potential horticultural applications for a modded Virtualight...
