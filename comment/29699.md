I've learned various of facts about microplastics today. There is a variant called nanoplastics they are so microscopic that they are comparable to the size of a thread of hair. When you are analyzing microplastics, use metal or glass equipment so you can prevent yourself from contaminating the microplastics. Also wear proper clothing during testing and analyzing. Dr. Rick Smith (the creator of Slow Death by Rubber Duck) tested microplastics using his own waste. He'd wear clothing and eat food that contained microplastics.
