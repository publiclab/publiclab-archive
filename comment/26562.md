This is a really well crafted proposal. With your track record, we have confidence in your ability to do it!

My worry is -- is there any way to bring your experience closer to our high priority projects? Maybe some of your skills on project organization, testing, architecture, could be relevant to our Editor projects? Or our Spam management system? I'm mainly thinking about this because we are likely to have significantly fewer slots this year, and will likely face some tough choices when we get to project selection. No reflection on the quality of the proposal, which we think is great on its own merits!

Thanks, Rishabh! We love CTB and know it's dear to your heart, and it's tough to have to make choices like this. But just trying to be transparent as we get close to the deadline. Thank you.
