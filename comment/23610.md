 Hi everyone! Just left another round of comments. Thank you all so much for your proposals! 

Also, copying in from https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/5022 :

Finally, we also recommend that people consider applying to the Summer of Code programs listed here -- you can use the same application as for Outreachy, or choose another from our ideas list (see the link):

https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/02-28-2019/call-for-summer-of-code-2019-proposals

This is because, although Google Summer of Code is not the same, we expect to see quite a few more slots funded by Google in that program and would love to consider your applications as part of that program too. Thank you, and we're happy to answer questions about it! The timeline is a little further back, and applications just opened. If you'd like to cross-list your proposal, please just add the tag soc-2019-proposals to your Outreachy proposal and it will be cross-listed, then apply to GSoC at:

http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com

Please note that requirements for applicants are quite different, but for those of you who meet GSoC's requirements, we would love to see your applications there too to increase the chances that we could accept more of you! Thank you!
