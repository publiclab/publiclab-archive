Sorry, back online after a long weekend. Looks like there was just an error in my code -- i'm going to try and tackle some bugfixes today but after that i'll give it another go. Thanks for checking -- and sorry it's a bit of an onerous round-trip to actually test this out. I can both visually inspect the output vs. your graph now, and also compare it to a fork of itself without the correction.
