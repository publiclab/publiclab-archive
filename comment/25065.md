Thank you [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) for answering this and mentioning that that helium "does not have much thermal mass". The temperature was my main hypothesis. Now I can rule that out and evaluate the source of the helium gas. It is not pure helium, it is not from a party store, but it is from a University gas supplier.
