Here's a write-up that I'm finding quite helpful:
http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/11-01-2013/why-a-red-filter-should-work-well-for-ndvi

Eyeballing the two spectral curves involving grass, it looks like a red filter centered at 650nm and an IR filter centered around 850nm would work.

Alternately, it looks like the ratio of the red channel to the blue channel might be equally good, at least for the grass example that's given.  It would help to know whether "dry grass" means "dead grass" or "alive but thirsty grass."

Would I get a spectral graph like that shown in that research note if I somehow pointed the Public Lab desktop spectrometer at a patch of grass on a sunny day?  Or would I need some optics to bring enough light into it for that to work?  Anyone know?  If there's an easy way to do it, I'm inclined to start with something simple like that, as it looks like a promising way to possibly meet the original objective of this thread without much effort and at low low cost (as compared to the cost of one or more cameras utilizing narrow bandwidth filters).
