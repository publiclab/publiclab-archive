Hello, thank you so much [@warren](/profile/warren) !!
I too believe that employing an additional stylesheet is preferable to overriding the existing screen styling, expecially considering the radically different outputs they produce. I have modified the proposed code sections & correlated explainations accordingly; I've also added a Testing Strategy section with the newly-upgraded, simplified approach to testing (thanks to the screen-print CSS rule separation). 
As I didn't originally manage to claim a first-timer-issue in time, thank you so much for proposing this - I'd absolutely love to take one!!
Thank you again for your feedback!
