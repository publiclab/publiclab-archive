These M12 vented screws give another .2mm of space for wires (2.5mm) and a knurled end for better purchase when turning.  I'd feel comfortable completely filling the hex-key head with glue on one of these:

but at $6.75 not including washers and nuts, they can't beat Blue Robotics. 

McMaster isn't known for cheap hardware.  They just have the best catalog. A better deal is probably available elsewhere and this is a more standardized  industrial part.
