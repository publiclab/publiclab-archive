Photos of both? Anyhow it would be cool to see either.

Wow, those are some great spectra... some very fine lines in there! 

Definitely the exposure times are difficult to deal with. You can adjust auto-exposure and exposure settings on some cameras, see http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/spectral-workbench-usage

But as the discussion on the mailing list shows, we're going to have to do some kind of radiometric calibration. I posted a brief note on this here: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/8-27-2012/spectrometry-discussion-across-web based on discussion on Hackaday. But the spectral analysis PDF someone posted on the mailing list also had some good ideas. I hope they publish it as a research note.
