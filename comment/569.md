The Thing about this report is that it doesn't take into account the Natural seeps of the Gulf.  i imagine they may be responsible for many (hundreds?) of the oil slicks reported to NRC each year (which number in the 3,000's).  

I am currently in the middle of circling back with Carrie Beth Lasley of UNO CHART and Ian McDonald (who has produced a GIS of natural seeps off LA coast).  

the noladiy.org forum is down at the moment, but i have some of the data displayed there, i'm also posting things to the GRN blog
