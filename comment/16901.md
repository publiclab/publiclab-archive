I almost fell over laughing at the name of this post (and am a bit jealous that I did not think of it...) Your logger should be running for much longer time.  Remember to clip off the LED's or they burn more power than the rest of the logger combined. Also, you only need a voltage regulator on the SD adapter board if you are using a 5v Arduino. SD cards work fine without reg&level shifter on a 3.3v promini board, and that saves alot of power.

Take a look at the way I put the bare bones units together:

The screw terminal expansion shield provides a nice base to hold the pieces together in a tight package that ought to fit inside your nalgene.  Also note that I only used tape for the first few of them, now I use epoxy putty ($5 a tube at the local hardware store) to hold the boards together very rigidly.
