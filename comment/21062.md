Hi [@iragersh](/profile/iragersh) - this sounds great! I wasn't able to find the Facebook Group you mentioned, so feel free to add the link to the facebook page or the email list signup in your post or down here in the comments. I've added a few tags to ping the NYC and Brooklyn regional folks who might also have an interest in this work.
