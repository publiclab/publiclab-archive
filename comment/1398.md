Wow, that is really remarkable. So the 1st one, pulled out and exposed, was it developed into negatives, or did you just use it directly after exposing it? Maybe the tutorial wasn't clear but the intent was that it be developed into negatives. But you may have discovered something new -- if that's undeveloped, it acts remarkably different, and the vegetation is clearly bluish and distinct. I would love to test both with a spectrometer to see what they're doing. Do you have enough that you could send a small 2cm x 2cm sample to me by mail?
