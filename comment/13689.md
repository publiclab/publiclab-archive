Hi [@kensanfran](/profile/kensanfran)

On the threat below you mentioned:

"So another part of my exercise has been building up various DIY calibration rigs using pre-mixed cal gases and valves and flow sensors and mass flow controllers and so on. I'm still refining and developing and will also be discussing these systems here in future research notes and would love to get feedback from others on how to improve things."

Do you have any references you can share on the topic? We are trying to start a project documenting DIY Calibration Methods for AQM Electrochemical sensors and MOS, and we are trying to collect as much references as possible

Thanks
