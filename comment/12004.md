Hi Tgran, 

I agree that we are probably reinventing the wheel. There seems to be a huge range of comfort with this type of simple electronics, So people who have figured out how to use a Nano on a KAP rig have a hard time explaining what they did except to the people who know more than they do about electronics. It would be great to make our progress accessible to a lot more people. 

This is related to the conundrum  of whether to offer a very inexpensive kit that requires soldering and will be shunned by most people, or whether to offer a ready-to-fly device that will be as expensive as products already available. 

Probably the best outcome will be if people modify our design and make it a better device. There still seem to be a lot of different ways to improve it, as evidenced by the [GitHub discussion about the power circuit.](https://github.com/p-v-o-s/sky-sweep/issues/3) I'm still not sure whether an LDO, big capacitor, or boost converter offers the best cost/size/performance benefits.

I have soldered together all the SkyShields I have now and they are all committed to packages with Saturn V Rigs. If there is one left this weekend I can sell you just the ready-to-go SkyShield controller (and Nano?) if you would like to try it out. It's possible that there will be new SkyShield version manufactured by mid July that will be offered as a kit. But I haven't heard from [@DonBlair](/profile/DonBlair) in a few days and he is the one driving Eagle Cad. The deadline for a mid July iteration is looming.

Thanks for your ideas,  
Chris
