I see your point. I just wonder about having only a single attenuation step which could make it difficult to find the best level; a case of too little or two much. Maybe a 4 step attenuator would help and still get 10 pixel lines or so per step.

Don't know the present algorithm used, but I found that averaging multiple frame data (same pixel line) to be more effective than averaging parallel pixel lines. I think this is because a large noise component is likely at a relatively low frequency and so be averaged out whereas parallel lines will all exhibit the same variation within a frame.
