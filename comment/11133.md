Hey, I also got myself the SainSmart MH-Z14 and I must say, I am not sure if I really trust the values. 
Mine (using Arduino and the UART interface) reads around 700ppm indoors, rising steadily to over 1000ppm when put outdoors.
These values look suspicious to me - they're twice as high as I'd have expected, and I don't really believe that outdoor CO2 levels (on my window sill on a winter day) are higher than indoors.
What's more, I get a rather suspiciously good (negative) correlation between the temperature and the CO2 concentration (r-square = 0.95).
Do you have any more insights into how reliable these measurements actually are?
Yes, my sensor does spike when I breathe at it, so it seems to react to CO2 changes, but beyond that I haven't seen evidence that this sensor actually does what the datasheet promises.

Judging by the few websites and Youtube movies that exist about this sensor, it seems that most people get measurements around 1000, and nobody seems to question that, even though, according to [1] "NIOSH considers that indoor air concentrations of carbon dioxide that exceed 1,000 ppm are a marker suggesting inadequate ventilation."
So, perhaps this sensor isn't actually working, or at least not with anywhere near the accuracy promised by the datasheet?
