I found out my guess about documenting hard to reproduce bugs are also close to what we already have in the issues page on https://publiclab.org/wiki/issues and the issue template in Publiclab.Editor repo. I'm wondering what should be the difference between the one required here and what we already have?



And about mapping to markdown from HTML, based on your comment in the chat room i'm also wondering if this 
[![custom-inserts.png](/i/39070)](/i/39070?s=o)

satisfies the need?
