I just updated the plugin and tested it. I suggest that Andre delete his version of the download Photo_Monitoring.jar and download the fresh version from Github. I'm not sure what the problem was or how long it's been a problem but hopefully this will fix it.  This is the URL for the download page. If you click on "View Raw" the file should download. Please let me know if this works.
