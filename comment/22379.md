Hi sohelikh, I don't know how to create a spectral distribution graph like those you say.</br>
The Spectralworkbench can be instaled in any computer running a local server for sure. You can install it in your laptop for example but I don't really know if an executable file can be done to port it let's say, in a pendrive.</br>
Installation instructions can be found here:</br>
https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench</br>
</br>
You can also shoot your pictures with your regular camera (not through the spectralworkbench tool) upload them to spectralworkbench.org and calibrate your spectra afterwards.</br>
