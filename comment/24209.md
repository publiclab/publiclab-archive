 Hi! You might be interested in some of the responses on this note:

I would also point out that since kites fly at an angle (and not straight up) measuring the length of string will give you the hypotenuse, but not the altitude, so you'd probably still need to do a little math to get that.

You could also use an anemometer-- a device that can capture data about your flight

OR an altimeter-- a tool that can help you measure elevation. I took a quick look around and I think there are phone apps that you can use.
