Thanks Chris for your response. My assumption was that the blue filter supplied with the RPI Noir camera blocks the red channel fully. So you get a clean NIR and blue channel. From your response I see that there are two problems, 1) The RPi camera most likely does not capture most of the NIR light. 2) the light that is captured is mixed, e.g. the red channel still has red and NIR mixed & the NIR itself is mixed. The only solution I see is to use two cameras with a known relative sensitivity (one of public labs examples). Is this correct? I hope that anyone else has tried working with the RPI camera as I still would like to look for a solution for it. I added a test picture I made with the camera in the question block above.
