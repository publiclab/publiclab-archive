Hi Ken, great description of all the hardware and photos !!
I was wondering have you got a software interface description  - whot runs over the serial link. 
Good to see you mentioning a TEDS - Transducer Electronic Data Sheet - so that the sensor can be queried for its meta data - "tell me about yourself" 
What format do you see that the TEDS will be in?  
I'm a fan of XML - but I wonder what other people like and find works on the de-serialization of data from a sensor. 
There is Sensor Markup Language 
http://52north.org/communities/sensorweb/incubation/sensorInterfaceDescriptors/
 I've also been tinkering with JSon (JSON.org) as an interface desciption - however it doesn't translate that easy to a spreadsheet.
thanks again for the great posting.
