Awesome! This is what I was hoping to see and then some.  I don't think I've ever seen something go from brainstorm to schematic so quickly!  I was trying to make a mash-up between the Visualight Schematics and the Sparkfun Eval board on Fritzing.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find a Fritzing part for the full Sparkfun MLX90614 Evaluation Board and I'm still learning how to create new parts.
   Its nice to see somebody using Upverter.com too!  How did you find it?  I've been hoping for a "Github for Hardware" for years and Upverter seems to be the closest so far.  The problem for me has been its emphasis on PCB fabrication and schematics which requires a certain specialized skillset for which I have much to learn. 
  Now that the Thermal Flashlight mashup seems to be well on its way, I'm thinking of incorporating the reference design into another project based on Public Lab research- A High-Power Red-Blue LED Grow-light configured to respond to visual plant health data collected through an IR-Camera.  Is it OK if I base some of the baseline sketches off of your thermal flashlight repo?  Having used Upverter, is this something you would recommend as well?
