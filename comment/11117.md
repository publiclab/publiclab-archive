I agree that looking over repeats will be difficult. I think it is worth it to draw any conclusions.

As much as I like your experiment, the lack of repeats means your single experiment and single result could be completely anecdotal. The perceived change could be due to unaccounted measurement error rather than the seeming controlled factor of dye or not. That's all I'm getting at.
