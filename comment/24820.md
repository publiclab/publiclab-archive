I love these and can't wait to see what's next. 

The EPA also has some air-quality materials that you could use for reference here: https://cfpub.epa.gov/airnow/index.cfm?action=aqikids.index

Another super fun (if dated) thing from the EPA is their "Dumptown" game where young people act as the mayor of a city and work to reduce waste. Here's a link: https://www3.epa.gov/recyclecity/index.htm
