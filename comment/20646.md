Hi Warren, thanks for your suggestions! Unfortunately that's not the case: I convert the values for all three channels to float64 right when I split them. 

Actually, I had a major breakthrough last night: the actual formula used in legacy (at least for my particular processing pipeline) is R-B, not the NDVI one. I managed to reproduce 100% the results on the legacy webgl one with this, but I'm puzzled at why does this happen. I saw no hint of this by looking at the javascript file (infragram.js) so could someone please explain what is going on? :D
