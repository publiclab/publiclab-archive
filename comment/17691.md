Thanks for pointing that out, Chris - and I agree on point 2, that's one reason [@liz](/profile/liz) started this issue.

From your 3) i see a potential suggestion for either renaming it "Recent related notes" OR reworking it so it's sorted to display, say, most popular or liked content? 

I like "recent by this author" -- nice suggestion

In 5) I see a potential suggestion to change the inline maps to not respond to scroll wheel zooming? 

on 6) -- indeed it is a priority, and we have a long-running project to expand and improve search services to do just that: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/1537 which we hope will be completed soon. 

Thanks for your input -- several of these are actionable, discrete steps forward and if you or anyone else agrees, I'm happy to help recruit some new contributors to solve these!
