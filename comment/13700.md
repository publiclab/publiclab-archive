Ha, this is great to see! 

I looked at the graph and my very first thought was "that doesn't look like a 405nm LED, it looks like a 395nm LED". And what do you know? This is especially good because it drops off earlier than the 405, leaving more data un-overlapped in the visible range, for fluorescence data. [@matej](/profile/matej) - take a look!

I would like to find a source for cheap but strong 395nm LEDs. Dave or [@stoft](/profile/stoft), know any? Extra points if it's 5v and can run on USB power. :-)

Dave, can you post links to your data, so I can plot it against the 405nm LEDs to see how wide the base of their peaks are?

Thanks, Dave!
