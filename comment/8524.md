Liz-- Definitely! Starting annotations BEFORE stitching is a super feature.  especially when kite/balloon mapping, I like making records of obstacles and stuff. 

xvidun--  Turning annotations, or maybe doing multiple layers of on/off annotations is a great idea.  I'm not sure organizing a lot of annotations into a particular area of the map is a huge problem-- people can just zoom in and put in smaller text--  It prevents the overloaded pinpoint/popup problem, and forces users to think about what they're really trying to communicate and at what scale.   

Aduma-- I mentioned Gina and Hagit's work for stylistic reasons and because they've thought a lot about information presentation.  We're looking for a dead simple web tool though.  For those who want pro geospatial capabilities,  I highly recommend the [OS Geo Live disk](http://live.osgeo.org/en/overview/overview.html).
