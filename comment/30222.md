Its very easy to get these two instruments confused.  If you are measuring color in industry(as in paint color, siding color, etc), its often with a colorimeter(Hunter is a popular brand) and the scales will be Lab. They are to measure color the way the eye sees it, although some of the models may also have an option for spectrum.

If the interest is in analysis, then the term is usually a spectrometer or spectrophotometer.  Thats when the term ROYGBIV(Red,Orange,Yellow,Green,Blue, Indigo, and Violet) starts to get bantered.  And the units are usually transmittance or absorbance.

There is some difference in optics.  The eye normally sees reflected light.  So most (not all) of the eye based optics ( and Lab scale) is based on reflected light.

Similarly, most water or liquid measurements are based on transmitted light.  

Having said that, many of the newer instruments are based on fluorescence and luminescence.   Whole different set of rules apply.
