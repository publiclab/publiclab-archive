Greetings from Barn Raising 2014.  Live from Lumcon!  We just finished a wonderful workshop on this tool, and there was a bit of a kerfuffle (slightly over dramatic) surrounding the file downloads.  The links on this page to download files from buldr are not working for me (they work for others).  We've created a folder that has all of the files in one place on the wiki page: http://publiclab.org/wiki/thermal-camera.  I think it would be worth putting a link at the top of this page to the wiki which can be the place for the most up to date files/links etc.
