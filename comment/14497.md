I think being able to explicitly save and return to drafts, invite others to collaborate are my priority features here.  What do you think about saving a "shared" draft such that more than one person can work on drafting/editing a note?   Right now multiple authors can be tagged but only one can edit.  Can the invitation to share a draft include an invitation to edit?

The Stepwise editing  that gives a 'template' for a post is helpful now, I like that it will be expanded to have event/question framings too.
