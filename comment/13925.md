Any place that sells paint has paint color chips, but these are too small to be useful as targets. But fancy paint stores have huge color samples. I got some 12" x 12" color chips when I was buying house paint at a California Paint store. Someone with a spectrometer (disguised as the owner of a gray house) could go to a California Paint store (is that a national brand?) and get a few gray samples to characterize. Then everybody could go to their local store (disguised as owners of gray houses) and get the same huge paint chips. Calibration targets galore.
