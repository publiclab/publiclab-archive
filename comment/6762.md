I wonder if, although the absolute NDVI values seem not to be helpful, the images may still be able to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy vegetation. It wouldn't be the same as NDVI, but if we're looking at, for example, IR+R, IR+G, and IR+B, might we still be able to extract meaningful information from the images -- just with different band arithmetic?
