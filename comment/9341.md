Hello Ron,
  Check out the more recent comments on my KAP post- http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/06-25-2014/kap-test-for-invasives-monitoring-project as I may have stumbled onto an open source approach for incorporating 3D into grassroots mapping.  I'm trying to figure out if its already been examined on PLOTs before, but I'll create a new research note if nobody else has.
