I didn't know you could buy a photodiode array for that little money. Fifty dollars for parts is a great deal. If there were explicit instructions for building and operating this type of thing I would be tempted. Is the photodiode array a single row CCD?

Does the software you use allow you to control exposure? Do you find the correct exposure by trial and error?

I have not heard of a spectrometer with the slit mashed up against the grating. Would it work better with some distance between them?

If you put a mirror at 45Â° into the cuvette hole, you could shine a fluorescent lamp in there for calibration. Although the light would not be collimated. It would work if there was some distance between the slit and grating.

Congrats on getting it working.
