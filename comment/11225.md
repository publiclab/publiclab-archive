I'm wondering if you took any account of the web camera settings - in particular colour temperature / white balance. This has quite a large effect on the gains of R,G and B. And the sunlight reference curve looks like it is of relatively low resolution compared to the PL spec output. The PL Spec plot may not have noise so much as actual signal.
