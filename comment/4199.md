So I can't spell and the spell check did not help much.

Another thing to do is just appropriately scratch a small area on a fully reflecting mirror so some of the light gets to the meter in order to get a relative intensity value.

I also have an idea on how to effectively couple the light into the fiber if you need to go that route.
