Awesome post:) I found lots of lichen on the oak trees in my town! Foliose I think.

Here's a bonus shot of all the Spanish moss growing on the oak trees too---however, it turns out "Spanish moss" is a complete misnomer as its not actually from Spain or moss (it's an epiphyte). I prefer the Native American term, Itla-okla, which translates to "tree hair"!
