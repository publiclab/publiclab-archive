 Hi [@mguarand](/profile/mguarand) - we would like some of the bigger issues to be solved, but we'll see how far we get over the course of the summer and adjust accordingly. There is also the possibility that more than one person would end up working on the project and we would divide the tasks in 2 or share them!

I'd love to hear your ideas!
