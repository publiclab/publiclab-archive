Good question [@liz](/profile/liz)! And the answer is that the order in which the images are selected to be included in a map does not make a difference, at least in this case. However, I did notice that the 'original' order of layering (the one I do not want in this case) seems to be the default order - every time I switch between tabs (Images, Export, About, Chat) the order reverts back to that original, even if the images are locked. This makes sense in that mapknitter seems to be reverting to that same original default when it does a task, like exporting. [@warren](/profile/warren) and others added the layer button back to mapknitter a few weeks ago, maybe the locking function does not yet work with the layer commands?
Also, the little vertical menu strip in the upper left that includes download and trash icons seems to disappear.
As always, thanks for your help on these issues!
