Hi, Ananyo -- just going through all the projects one by one now. 

I wanted to thank you once again for such great work this summer -- you've been involved very actively in many different aspects of the codebase, even well outside of your own work, and without neglecting your own project. You've been very responsive and communicative, both to me and to other students -- and even to new contributors who've picked up your `first-timers-only` posts. 

Your level of documentation, thoroughness and responsiveness, going as far as to fix other peoples' bugs, is impressive and deeply appreciated. I was gratified to see your quick and thoughtful responses to my input on your new features and designs. I also want to note that your positive and constructive attitude, even in the face of complex or difficult challenges, made it a pleasure to work with you at all times. 

Finally, with regard to the `friendly_id` project, I know that was a tough one, but given the complexity of the task, its involvement of poorly documented legacy code, and the difficulty of working with legacy data, I think it could have been much worse -- and the rapid response to the difficulties that ensued was excellent. All in all, I appreciate that you sought to reform and revise this system that really did need it, and that you've worked to document next steps should we try to make a new attempt. Again, this was outside the scope of your project and did not in any way affect the completion of your planned work. 

To sum up -- exemplary work, and I hope to work with you more! The Q&A system is already seeing heavy use and we anticipate it'll be a major part of Public Lab's future! Thanks!
