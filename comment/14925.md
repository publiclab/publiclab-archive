Of these options, the rubber band holds the firmest-- simplest and cheapest, though rather ugly looking.

[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)'s points about pins are good ones, and I'm not against using them.
Pins, however, mean making single-use parts for a specific point in the rig.  That may be where we go.  I'm not opposed to it.  But ideally, we'd create a kit that is flexible and invites substantial modification of the existing parts as well as substitution with easy-to-find bits, like wood dowels. 

I believe a friction-fitting helps facilitate that interaction, and am therefore interested to thoroughly pursue it.
