[@mathew](/profile/mathew) I see some UI issues there.
In the new upload modal, images are automatically placed when uploading is done, for now you might need to manually close the upload modal.
The new interface is available at "beta pages", I might have missed some links to point to beta pages. Did you try creating a new map from http://107.178.213.64/beta ?
