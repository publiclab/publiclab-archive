Here is a proposal which might reconcile a few of the ideas presented here including:

1. [@stoft](/profile/stoft)’s great idea of using a checklist to determine if a research note meets some minimum standard,
2. [@david-days](/profile/david-days) reference to community rankings, and
3. [@Liz](/profile/Liz) and [@Warren](/profile/Warren)'s morbid fear of an accreditation body.

### Proposal for peer review of research notes

1. Establish a checklist of qualities desirable in a “research grade” research note. For example, rank these from 1 to 5:

      a. Relevance -- to Public Lab’s mission, tools, hopes, and dreams  
      b. Rigor – How convincing are the conclusions? (Sample size, good technique, logical arguments, etc)  
      c. Reproducibility – How well are the methods documented?  
      d. Intent – Why was this project done? For fun? For self-promotion? To make the world a better place? To contribute to the Public Lab community?  
      e. Legibility – Is the information accessible to the Public Lab community? Are the relevance and conclusions clearly explained?  
2. Anyone can participate in the ranking of any research note. A publiclab.org account is needed, and the user name will be attached to every ranking. Rankings are displayed with each research note. Every ranking must include all items on the checklist.
3. Each research note will be evaluated with a simple rule (e.g., Research Grade requires no rank lower than 3, average total score at least 19).
4. The ranking period is finite. After maybe two to four weeks, the status of the research note is locked. 
5. Research notes receiving no rankings are just like most research notes today, soon pushed down the page and forgotten.
6. Appeals can be made in the comments of the research note. Duke it out with the community. If you don’t like the result, post another research note. 

This type of process can be tampered with, e.g., by getting your friends to rank your trashy note. So the ultimate authority must rest with the Public Lab staff to intervene if shenanigans are suspected. 

One weakness of this system is that the author can edit the research note during the ranking period, and some rankers might then want to change their rankings. So ranking a note is very easy and quick (several checkboxes) but it carries some responsibility to monitor the note during the ranking period for improvements or unacceptable changes.

Another weakness is that an author can edit a “research grade” note after the ranking period and revert it to a state deemed unacceptable by some rankers. But who would do that?
