Thanks, [@mimiss](/profile/mimiss) : Before I ventured out on this Activites I researched on a few of things EPA tried in past which inspired me too.

Also, I wanted it to be in the form of a Handbook or Activity book as anyone would use Pencil and play with it. Then Erase, share it with friends and somehow sense of purpose starts building around Air they inhale & exhale. Suprise Games are coming along the way, but all these simple games students would have come across in their usual studies(EX: Choose, Match, Unscramble, etc)

PS: I do not want these Games to be Digital based as it affects their health & tends to Browse if they are less aware of things.
