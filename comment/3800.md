Thanks Mat. The paucity of easily accessible answers to your question suggests that they don't really understand what happens when syrup is made. All you find is phrases like "chemical changes" and "browning reaction."
I was once very happy with dark maple syrup. Then I boiled down a good run of early sap and learned that it really deserves the pretentious name "Fancy." Then I learned that an important cause of browning is biomass in the sap. Bacteria colonize the carbohydrate-rich sap very quickly when it gets warm, and then it generally makes dark syrup. There is a lot of dark syrup made, and I fear a lot of the "browning reaction" is due to long storage of sap and over heating. Its hard to make light colored syrup without being careful, so it's a reliable sign of quality. It's also so good it almost tastes buttery.
