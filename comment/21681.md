 OK, great research. So to sum up:

1. if we take steps towards implementing in React, we would have a pathway to approach a native iOS/Android app using React Native
2. if we develop a Notifications API, we can plan ahead to allow native apps to integrate nicely with such notifications as well

Is this about right? Thank you!
