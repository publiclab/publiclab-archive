[@mathew](/profile/mathew) What do you mean by " small control orifice into a brass rod and put it at the intake"?  I hope you are thinking manometer  . . .

What I suggest is pump to needle valve to T with one end on the manometer tube and the other going to the orifice and from the orifice to a second T then the other end to the manometer and formaldehyde tube.

There is a method of making a pin hole camera that Kodak published many years ago that might be pretty easy and will produce an almost ideal orifice.  My concern was connecting the orifice in line with the tube.  I think it would be hard to get a thin orifice by axially drilling a rod.  Perhaps carefully soldering 2 brass tubes to either side of a brass orifice?
