Hi [@bdebaque](/profile/bdebaque) sounds interesting! Do you know at what altitudes pm 2.5 measurements remain relevant for surface level exposure?  If so I'd love to know. Or are you interested for general science reasons and not necessarily ground exposure reasons? 

Looking forward to hearing more about this project as it advances.
