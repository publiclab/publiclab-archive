Thanks for the detailed response Chris, this is super helpful! I really appreciate the feedback.

So I have actually been provided the full characteristic spectrum of the phytotron below:

[![phytotron_spectrum.PNG](/i/35662)](/i/35662?s=o)

The solid line shows when both the fourescent and incandescent lights being used (we will be using both). So from this chart we could actually get the exact ratios of NIR and blue light in our chamber. Below is the datasheet for the Rosco blue 2007 filter:

[![rosco_blue_transmission_spectrum.PNG](/i/35663)](/i/35663?s=o)

So according to this we should be getting about 10% transmission of red light, does that mean I should subtract 10% of each pixel value in the red channel in order to remove red noise in the NIR channel? Can I use the information in these charts for anything else?

I was able to find the quantum efficiency charts for the visible spectrum for the Raspberry Pi Camera however I cannot seem to find any information on the NIR spectrum for the NoIR camera. If I had that information would I be able to use that and avoid the calibration process? Isn't the calibration process basically finding a transformation for the sensitivity of the camera vs the spectral characteristics of our lighting or am I misunderstanding the purpose of calibrating to known reflectances? 

As far as what you said about using two cameras. We will actually be using two cameras anyways. One of the cameras we will need the full color spectrum though so would not be able to use a red bandpass filter. We are trying to do water/nutrient stress prediction using both color and IR characteristics. Could we simply use an NIR cutoff filter on the Pi NoIR and use the red channel from the RGB camera to find these calculations?

Lastly, we are actually looking into ways to possibly avoid using NDVI. We may take a more data driven approach to determine a custom transformation of the NGB images based on differences between the healthy and water stressed plants. That would eliminate all the issues with calibration and white balancing needed for accurate NDVI. In the end we only want to use the data to do water stress prediction using machine learning, so NDVI may not even be needed and we could directly infer that from the NGB (or just NIR) data.
