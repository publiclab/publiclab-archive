Update:
  I had a great conversation with Patrick from http://uaviators.org/ about developing this build for humanitarian applications!  I look forward to further development in this area!
  Beyond further refining the MultiWii code this build is based on, one possibility that immediately comes to mind is further integration between flight plotting software and programs like Mapknitter.
