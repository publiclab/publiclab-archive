Hey Mushroomman! 

Fellow mycology fanatic here seeking some community resources that eventually led me to your post- I studied mycoremediation in my undergrad research in SW Colorado, focusing on the effectiveness of Pleurotus ostreatus in the degradation of aminopyralid herbicides, which have demonstrated persistence in SW organic soils. Since then I have been searching for more information or individuals interested in further pursuing this field. I am now living in Washington state, and given the increasing shoreline contamination in this area, seems like a great place to try it out. Would love to hear more about your plans for the brownfield site projects and become more involved in any capacity.
