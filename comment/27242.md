I wanted to share something that was shared on Open Call that I thought might be of interest to you [@limako](/profile/limako), It's called the [Nerves-Project](https://www.nerves-project.org) and uses the [Elixir language](https://elixir-lang.org) (Ruby-inspired, not object oriented language, more functional). The platform is designed to allow you to write code, flash to your hardware, and be up and running and is compatible with Arduino and RPis, as well as other systems that can run Linux. It also includes some software to allow for over-the-air updates to your system without having to plug it back in, which is awesome for tools that may be set up in a place that you don't have easy access to. They have a monthly meetup on Wednesdays, [more info on that here](https://nerves.group). I'm not an expert on this myself, but thought it sounded cool and was worth sharing.
