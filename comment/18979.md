Oh, I was just suggesting that you connect your proposal to existing projects to show how youll be able to make progress that builds on what's come before -- and not reinvent the wheel -- but of course I like some of the ideas you have here and I think they can be a really nice way to make progress on issues that others have also recognized. 

I would like to hear a bit about the maintainability and Bootstrap compatibility too! Thank you!
