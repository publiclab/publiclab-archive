I played with this image quite a bit, and could get very little plant health information from it. You recognized one of the problems -- there is no channel in which plants are the brightest thing. The histogram of just the tree tops illustrates another problem. The red and blue channels are nearly identical, apparently because they are both dominated by infrared light. The green channel is darker. Swapping the blue and green channels does not accomplish much. Using the original green channel for the visible channel in NDVI calculations maybe fails because the green channel has so much IR in it even though it is darker. Maybe your only hope is matrix math.
