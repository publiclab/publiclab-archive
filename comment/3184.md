Hi Chris,

Great write up.  So the impacts of narrowing the slit would be better resolution, but less light reaching the sensor - lower sensitivity.  How can we correct this in spectralworkbench so that your spectra are comparable to others?  It's the same problem as concentration of a solute, no?  We need a way to adjust for modifications to the tool.  Assuming the calibrations are correct, a peak would be in the correct spot, but not have a comparable height/

It would just be an adjustment to the formula used in the code for the intensity of light at each wavelength, right?  Is the current formula viewable on GitHub?
