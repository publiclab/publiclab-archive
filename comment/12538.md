Thanks for the reply Chris.  Your observations are very insightful.  My thoughts are currently toward reproducing some of your tests with hooking up my camera to the public labs spectrometer and measuring a variety of different filters.  My main goal is to use this camera to begin mapping fields to look for archaeological features that may be visible by subtly affecting plant growth.  The more I'm reading, I suspect that a red filter will give me a deeper NIR signal that may be better than the ~740 nm range that I think I'm collecting now.
