Great progress!

I would bet that the screws you used before were transferring ions to the water, and that the stainless corrodes more slowly.  Looking at the image, it looks like the earlier screws were light steel or stainless though-- I would expect to see some degradation of light steel or galvanized.

as for potting, are you using an epoxy, or an air-drying medium?  If you can let the adhesive settle out for a few hours, the bubbles will go away.  A quick, zig-zag pour with no overlapping trails of glue will minimize the bubbles.  

If its an epoxy and you have to get rid of the bubbles fast, use a vibrator.  I found a vibrating foot massager at a yard sale that worked really great, also, you can tape a random orbital sander in place on a table.
