Yeah that's pretty much it -- and if you don't want what other people have added to a given area (an area you're working in, say) you can display only your own additions, and perhaps time-bound them as well. This model prefers filtering out stuff you don't want, as well as revision and recovery, over deletion. 

The part that would "never change" is the export. That's where you make a selection of images and annotations, and save them. I think each "view" could generate a number of exports -- say, a timeseries, or before/after. But in assembling your export, you could see others' additions if you like. 

I know this is a bit of a different model, but it would solve a lot of issues with having to duplicate maps, etc. -- and also would allow for easier comparison and interaction between what we now call different maps. It'd also give more control in selecting a set of images for export.

Justin - what do you think about, on the edit page, making the images just a little harder to mess with -- say, you have to double click them, or click once and click on the "edit" button or something -- so that by default, you are just panning around the map?
