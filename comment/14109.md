Thanks Chris,
I don't expect that anyone will be making much money off of open-source science stuff.  I see this as more of a service to my discipline (lowering the cost of teaching so that more people can learn about solid phase synthesis).
The design has been through a few rounds of prototyping so it's availability should save people a fair bit of time.  
Thanks for bringing the pololu servo to my attention.  I will check that out.  Servocity will modify the servos that the sell, but the markup is a little high for it to be worth it to me.
Thanks again,
Jack
