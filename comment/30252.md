I tried using a dashcam for something similar. I had one in old car, but didn't need it [in my new car](https://transportation.report/vehicles/2022-toyota-prius-eco-7/) (which has a backup cam), so all of a sudden I had a spare cam. I wanted to see it up do to some time-lapse work around my home, but ultimately I wasn't able to use it for all the reasons you'd expect -- it's a pain to mount, the resolution isn't as high as other options, there is no wifi connection, the software controls are limited, etc. I ended up using a $20 wyze cam (any brand would work) and it's been doing the job fine.
