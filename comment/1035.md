It's probably not the best idea I've ever had to start poking around broken electronics with metal tools, but I'm cheap and it kills me to think of just throwing the thing out without even trying to fix it.  I'm sure the first time I accidentally touch the capacitor for the flash I'll change my mind.

The A495 was really easy to repair the lens on, but I think that's in part because it's a much cheaper and simpler camera than the SD4000.

Spectrometry...that reminds me, I still need to catch a firefly!  Though it turns out you can just buy <a href="http://www.biovision.com/staybrite-highly-stable-luciferase-related-products-1710/">luciferase</a>.
