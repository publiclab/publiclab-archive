Hi cfastie! I really think that your work is pretty awesome and for that im trying to do some experiments with the NoIR camara and your "Rosco filter". 
As I understand you have 3 band in a RGB photo, Red, green and blue. when you are taking off the IR filter what you are doing is increasing the amount of energy who is been register for your Red band, and what you do with your filter is leasing just the IR in the RED band, so you will have a IR-G-B photo... I´m right?
BUT!
in http://publiclab.org/wiki/ndvi, liz say that what will have in the differents channels is NOT the IR-G-B, and will be IR-R-G ....
can you please see that? I really think that is wrong because if I´m right any sensor in the camara can read some wavelenght of light and if you take off the IR filter you are not changing the other channels!
Thanks for your answer!
