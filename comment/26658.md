Hi Nick-

Question: are you hoping to come up with some ideas for people on the inside who are making their own masks, or are you thinking about organizing donations of masks/materials (this is obviously much more challenging, but may not be impossible). 

My understanding (I've been fitted for respirators in the past, though that was a loooong time ago) is that the issue with facial hair is that it prevents a respirator-style mask from sealing properly on a user's face (you get suction when it's on right), allowing unfiltered air into the mix, but cloth/surgical/paper style masks aren't  designed to seal on the face-- they just provide a barrier-- the molded/cup style masks have a closer fit and therefore a *better* barrier, but that's about it.  I'm guessing even a slightly larger version of the deaconess mask-- maybe one with the bands running lengthwise that could scoop under a wearer's chin and be tied off with a little tension (not containing abeard, but pushing it back a bit) would at least be on par with most of the fabric masks that are out there (which sadly, is still a very limited amount of protection). 

It might be a little moot given the overall shortage of PPE and the obstacles that exist to getting anything into the hands of incarcerated individuals, but for folks with beards who require *respirators*, there are versions that are more like a hood than a mask (look up "bardas"-- that's one of the styles out there,  and there are some interesting Q&As here: : [https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/1996-10-03](null) and here: https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/2003-03-07-0
