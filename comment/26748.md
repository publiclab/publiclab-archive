Hi Damian, Sorry to hear of this trouble!
Tomorrow, and every Tuesday at 3pm ET / 7pm GMT, find us on the video link listed at the top of: https://pad.publiclab.org/p/opencall. You could share your screen and we could see if there's anything we might notice that could help. 

If this time doesn't work for you, perhaps use this little open source program https://www.cockos.com/licecap/ to record an animated gif, and upload it here. Please let us know how things are going with your project. Thank you and sorry again to hear of your trouble!
