It looks like most of the cheap hygrometers are of the coil and dial variety which I worry about the robustness of. 

This one is temp and humidity for 11.39 (free shipping). The lab thermometers I saw were all very long.

The bigger the card the farther the camera has to be from the tube and the less accurately we can verify the reading. so compactness might be a priority for this one. 

also my tube kept rolling off the photo card. in the original i had cut a sliver of paper to fold back into the open lip of the tube that held it in place with no added glue, but we could also just put a spot of two sited tape on there.
