Well, I'll chip in an alternative $0.02. I view formal / official peer review, the peer review 'scientific' concept, the peer review concept and engineering as related but individual. The formal peer review ('sign off' by authorities) provides an authoritative reference point, the peer review concept as science provides a process to filter out bad science and engineering provides a practical framework to 'peer review' by way of success and failure to achieve a result which is grounded in the rules of good science. All of the above is, and must be, well grounded in the scientific process and principles. As yet, I've not been able to grasp a definition of 'citizen science' as it cannot simply be a 'democratization' of 'science' as those two terms are at odd with each other.
