     The diversity or number of organisms in an ecosystem is called biodiversity. It's crucial to our survival. The more biodiversity, the more stable an ecosystemâ€™s structure is. The different types of biodiversity are gene diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity. Biodiversity keeps interdependent organisms alive, as well as whole ecosystems. Blue fin tuna is the most desired species of tuna consumed by humans. Their population has decreased by 95%.
