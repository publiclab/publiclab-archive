It looks like Andre might have an older version. His menu options are:

- List images 
- Register Images 
- Create NDVI from image 
- Create NDVI from Dir

The options I get are the ones Ned listed:

- Create dual image list 
- Dual image NDVI processing 
- Single image NDVI from directory 
- Single image NDVI from displayed image

I have not re-installed or updated the plugin lately. I'm not sure how Andre would have gotten an older version.
