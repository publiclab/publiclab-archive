Hi RJ, it was me who Don was talking to.  I find it amusing that if everyone stuck to the digital world no one would know (or care) how junky many of those AC to USB power supplies really are.  Better designs for use in analog systems would require ripple (left over from rectifying the AC sine wave) filtering components like bigger capacitors that would add a few more nickles and dimes to the bill of materials.  Noise sources abound and taming them can sometimes seem like witchcraft.
