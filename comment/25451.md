[@stevie](/profile/stevie), [@warren](/profile/warren), [@jeffalk](/profile/jeffalk), [@Aleah](/profile/Aleah) and [@Cbarnes9](/profile/Cbarnes9). Our issue with the data files is to be able to amalgamate numerous 24-hour csv files that are written to the PurpleAir sd card into a single Excel workbook so we can analyze and plot all the data.

Four such files are attached to this note. Any help would be appreciated.
