They were mostly first and second year enthusiastic students, they were very excited and as you can see in the picture, more students than we expected came in the event. I asked them to check the plots2 repository in their phones, and many of them looked and read about it.
They had many questions and I tried to address them, for example, they asked about the guidelines followed at Public Lab, and many more things.
I explained about my work, but as most people didn't have any prior knowledge so they didn't understand much, but they're looking forward to get involved in the open-source.
