I like the idea of linking to other notes that set the stage for the current one. I was using the `response:#####` powertag for a while, but that does not seem to trigger a display consistently, and some people probably missed the display when it was there. The `series:####` powertag is also relevant, but it might be nice to reserve that for a certain type of series.

The data logging Open Hour looks interesting. I have been avoiding web conferencing to spare everyone the disruption from my shabby rural bandwidth, but maybe I can connect via chat or something.
