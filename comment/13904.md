Just a quick suggestion:  I've been using pex swivel adapters in my underwater connectors:

They sell for about a buck each, and give you a cone washer and a pass through hole in the same contiguous piece.  They come in several sizes, and if you were really lucky, you might even be able to find a bottle size where the threaded pressure ring was close enough to grab on the threads of your bottle. But if not it would be pretty easy to simply drill the right diameter hole in the bottles cap, and use that as the pressure ring.  I tap the inside and then fill the pass-through with epoxy after sealing around the cables with heat shrink tubing.

So far these have survived more than 8 months down around 10m depth.
