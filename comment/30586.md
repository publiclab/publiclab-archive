The relationship shared by farm-raised catfish and tilapia fish is a parasitic relationship. Catfish lay their eggs in tilapia territory, which causes tilapia to treat the catfish eggs as her own. The catfish egg hatches earlier than the tilapia eggs, and the baby catfish feeds on tilapia eggs. This makes the relationship beneficial for the catfish and harmful to the tilapia.
