After reviewing these posts it became apparent that there are two questions here. One is about "eliminating" humidity, possibly by mechanical means; the other would be about taking humidity into consideration, for example, in the calibration or validation regression. In fact, I will be brazen and ask how either of the monitors is calibrated and converts counts to concentrations. If any use is made of comparisons to a Wisconsin DNR monitor, it would matter if that monitor makes corrections for humidity.
