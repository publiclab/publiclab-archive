[@warren](/profile/warren) Thanks for the barnstar! I put an answer, but not a definitive one on the question.

[@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) When I get the next one built I'll see if your flow meter is available, that sounds great. I don't intend to run the fan through a tube thats for sure, they will move air differently (making a lot of assumptions here) but the pump is a pressure device first, and a flow device second because it's built for pushing air to the pressure (& rate) required at the bottom of a tank of water. For fan I expect I might have to make a manifold if I can't get it into a good position, but there is a lot of air space between the rocks. These little fans are rated at something like 5-7 CFM, although a heat sync is easier to push air through than rocks :-) We'll see! I might also need to put something like an equivalent fiber filter in just to keep it somewhat equivalent.
