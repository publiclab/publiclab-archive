Hi. I needed a similar valve (albeit for higher pressures) recently, Made one much like yours, except I used a swagelok 40 series ball valve and a set of aluminum brackets.
I also tried using the same coupling you have here, but unless you are very lucky and the valve stem happens to be very near the exact diameter, they do not work. Servocity and many other RC hobby places sell a better kind of coupling - the one meant for connecting two shafts. You'd need a shaft that mounts on the servo motor gear too.
