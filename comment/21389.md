[@warren](/profile/warren) I'm with [@Liz](/profile/Liz) that it looks cute. Also, on a Fritzing diagram I think this will be clear enough. It is actually easier to find the hole for a wire when you can count its proximity from a nearby wire that is in a hole--especially since the letters and numbers on these small boards are so hard to read. That's how most of my kids were navigating--by a previous placed part or wire. If you think this is a good final version I can do the update on Fritzing and post.
