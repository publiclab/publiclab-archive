I know not everyone like the name "open open hardware" - but until we have a better one, I like its reference to this methodology designed for software contributions: http://openopensource.org/

And I want to make reference as well to the great guide to "Contributing to Public Lab Software" originally penned by [@justinmanley](/profile/justinmanley): https://publiclab.org/wiki/contributing-to-public-lab-software

We should have a session on this at the Barnraising!
