Great!

1) I'd also suggest using stiff cardboard, Exacto knife, hot-melt glue (or fast-set 'yellow' wood glue

2) use double-stick for the DVD attach so you can place it several times until the alignment to the camera is right (nice horizontal spectral line in the camera image)

3) Build the DVD+Cam as a sub-assembly

4) Build the slit as a sub-assembly (separate them by about 8-10 in ... ideally at the 'focus' but not a very critical distance because the webcam lenses have such a large DOF (depth of field) )

5) Use stiff corrugated cardboard (or wood) as a 'base'

6) Leave the slit and dvd-cam assemblies adjustable on the 'base' until you get a good spectrum centered in the webcam image (you can do this all 'offline' w/o the PLab's software).

7) Once aligned, glue the assemblies down and 'hold/clamp/other' the whole assembly so it can't move with respect to the light source and the samples
