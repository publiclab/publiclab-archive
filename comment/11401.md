Hi Grayson, This looks really nice - a great little setup. I think you made good choices: using two sensors close together with a (relatively) narrow band red filter and low/moderate resolution sensor so image size is easier to process and there are benefits to integrating the signal from a larger ground surface area in a pixel. If you are able to calibrate the sensors so they record radiance that would be fantastic but even without that you will get images that show relative changes in NDVI (or whatever index you choose to use) across the image and that should be fine if you're looking for signs of vegetation stress. There are some Python libraries for SIFT image matching that you could explore if the FIJI plugin is too cumbersome for the work you want to do. Or, you can feel free to add a geotagging option to the FIJI plugin. Well done. Thanks for sharing.
