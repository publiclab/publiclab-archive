Thanks for the papers! Unfortunately benzene is one of the VOCs of concern, and based on the conclusions of that first paper, sensitivity is still a big concern alongside price. 

The performance of the consumer grade sensors compared to the professional grade monitors in the second paper doesn't inspire much confidence.

We'll keep looking for options, and if anyone has any experience with VOC badges (and what analysis might cost), I'd appreciate hearing your thoughts!
