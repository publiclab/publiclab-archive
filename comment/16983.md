Sid,

Pretty big difficulties. The sensor does not know what hit it. Each pixel produces a value for brightness (for one channel) which depends on how many photons impacted the pixel. The pixel does not know whether the photons are visible or NIR light. The processor knows what color light (RGB) it *expects* in each channel, but we never tell the processor that we removed the IR cut filter. So there is no way of knowing how much of the brightness value is due to visible light versus NIR light.

If you had two cameras, one unmodified and one with no IR cut filter, and took the same photo with exactly the same settings, then the difference between the brightness values for paired pixels would be due to the additional photons of NIR light (also additional UV photons that the IR cut filter might block). You would have to capture raw image files and control all settings manually. 

Hey, that might be a really good way to do it.
