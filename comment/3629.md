Wow, amazing! I can also send you some developed film, i have a whole roll. 

Question! This sentence caught my eye!

> The dangling bit coming off the circuit board is a light sensor that helps the webcam find the proper exposure levels.

WHAT!? really? I assumed it was a microphone! I've been clipping it out of all the spectrometers! If that's true, we have another way to control exposure on the spectrometers... would be very exciting. Can you confirm this?

Thanks, great writeup, don, and AMAZING to see it starting to work!!
