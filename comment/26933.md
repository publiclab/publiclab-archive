>What should I do to this pictures to improve the NDVI calculation?   
  
There is not much that can be done after the photo is taken to improve its ability to provide good NDVI results.

>How am I supposed to do the white balance with the red card?  

Many cameras have a feature that allows a custom white balance. If the software for your camera does not allow this, it is not an option for you.

>Is it true that by using the red filter there are some contamination of NIR in the red  
 channel?

Yes.

> is that why the NDVI calculation is not accurate?  

That is one reason.

A photo that can be converted to NDVI should have about three times more brightness in the NIR channel than in the VIS channel. Your photos have about 1.5 more NIR than VIS. A good candidate photo for NDVI using a red filter should have a color like this for healthy plants:

Below is an NDVI image made with Fiji from your photo. There is some very general plant health information there.  Much of the pattern of NDVI is due to brightness and shade, not differences in plant health. It is best to have the scene illuminated evenly by the sun, and even better on bright cloudy days when there are limited shadows. Having the sun behind you helps a lot.
