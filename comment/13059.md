I don't believe those are clipped - I increased the exposure until it just barely touched the top, but did not depress or deform the top of the curve - this was to ensure very high dynamic range of data, and in the 2nd one above (crude), it enabled us to get the red channel data even though the blue channel was quite strong. Do you think we really need to back off well away from 100% even if the curve shape is unaffected, and why?
