Very nice. I printed the last one. You got the spacing so the nuts will fit exactly right.

I think the indents for screw heads on the new model can be a little smaller, but that is exactly what I was thinking of. The wall of the horizontal tube gets reduced to just two printed extrusion layers, so maybe make the indents 50% to 75% as deep as they are now.

I think the set screws will be just barely accessible with a small screwdriver on the Aerobee Rig. It might be nice to have them at an angle just a bit closer to 45°. They are otherwise in a good location.

It looks like the space for the nut might have shrunk in the new version. 

It would be good to have more material on the outside of the tube opening.  I guess there will have to be a bulge there. Might as well make it a big bulge to get as much strength as possible. Splitting there is a real vulnerability. The bulge can extend back over the screw hole. That will make it hard to use a screwdriver on the screw, but in all of the KAPtery rigs that place is for a nut, not the screw head. So the nut can be accessed from the side. 

I will restrain myself and wait to print the current version this time.
