[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie). I think you are right. The problem must be the filters. I will open the cam and see what happens. I'm just using the product the way I bought - no modification was performed. Can you recommend a software besides ArcMaps, that calculate values as mean, maximum, etc? Thanks again!
