Hi wyzac

How are you planning to go forward with aluminium holographic foil? Have you tried them already?
I am using a flat-field concave grating currently. It does away with need of any mirrors/lens systems.
But still thinking where to get them custom made, and how to replicate these to bring their costs down.
