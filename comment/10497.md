Hi, thanks!  This is actually my first project using a 3D printer...  Looks like you guys are doing some pretty cool things there!  I like the synthetic aperture radar :)  Sounds like we have pretty common goals.. I'm not a member of any hackerspaces, I've thought about it... but I want to develop a number of devices like this for people to use and adapt..  Unfortunately, at least for now.. there's no 'you guys' here.. lol.. It's just me working on this..  I started it for a need I had for another project..and then the hackaday prize, and the folks at hackaday inspired me to share it with the world.. =)  There's a lot more detailed information at http://hackaday.io/project/1279  ..  Thanks for the good word!  I'll be sure to keep an eye on your open-hardware projects!
