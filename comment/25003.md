### Low power operation:  

To run your data logger for a long time on small batteries, you can put the Arduino and other components to sleep between logging events. Any logger based on an Arduino Pro Mini (328p) can be put to sleep effectively, but getting the batteries to last a month requires getting a lot of ducks in a row. The Riffle has two advantages over some other 328p Arduinos:  
1. It has a physical switch which disables the USB circuitry (which is a power hog)  
2. It has a mosfet which can be programmed to turn off the micro SD card slot (which can be hard to make sleep well) between logging events.

The low power link you include in your comment might be a good resource for programming a Riffle to sleep. The code [posted by Kina Smith](https://publiclab.org/notes/kinasmith/06-14-2016/fixed-riffle-sd-card-power-consumption) might be the best implementation of the sleeping capabilities of the Riffle. I never got very far sleeping the Riffle but got a $2.00 Arduino Pro Mini to log data every 15 minutes for [seven weeks by sleeping everything](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/12-18-2017/longer-mini-pearl-logging) and by doing several other things (Table 1 in that note). The sketch I used is linked there. Mashing up that sketch and the one linked to this note (plus some Riffle specific code if needed) could provide what you need.

### I2C sensors:

I think the lines of code you included in your comment are associated with the SD card, not an I2C sensor. Unless there is some unusual code in the sketch, I2C sensors can be connected to pins A4 and A5 (SDA to A4, SCL to A5, [plus power and ground]). I don't see any code in the sketch you linked to that would prevent pins A4 and A5 from working with an I2C sensor.

It should be pretty easy to set you up with code that runs a Riffle or other 328p Arduino and logs the data you need.
