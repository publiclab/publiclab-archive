 [@dusjagr](/profile/dusjagr) Hi, my name Jackie (from Tonawanda, NY). I checked out your work, very cool! We have done quite a lot of work using citizen science (in particular air and soil testing) for environmental justice to hold a local industrial facility accountable for their their pollution. In fact, they recently shutdown largely due to our efforts. We have created a soil sampling toolkit. I was thinking that using our [toolkit ](https://publiclab.org/notes/bronwen/10-19-2018/using-the-soil-sampling-toolkit)
may be of interest to you and your group.
