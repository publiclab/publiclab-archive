Hi Warren, thanx again for your input. I meanwhile found the problem: the double-sided tape that was supposed to hold the camera in place just stuck to a (loose) quality control sticker on the backside of the camera which eventually came off. The tension of the attached wire pushed the camera off the wooden block holder thus changing the way of the light. I reattached the camera to the block using single sided sticky tape and got this full spectrum now:
