a memory… (and a tribute to ann chen which I have never met but, like many others in the public lab, I already have this strange feeling we share so much together) 
so, a memory...from one of the lovely and unexpected places I got to, with my public lab wings. The Tactical Tech Info-Activism camp near Lake Orta in Italy, 2013, were I had the chance to meet so many incredible people. Of course I brought my red kite with me :-P (This kite soon will be five years old as well!) We decided to fly the kite with the camera during a boat trip in the lake.. from some reason we were sure that the kite will fly as the boat is moving… it was windy... it made sense...
We were wrong - it went nicely up and then dropped - straight down towards the water. I remember Mikel (responding like a real crisis mapper!) pulling it towards us before it reached the water - and at the last moment, he made it! 
It was such a beautiful day - here are some photos :) https://www.flickr.com/photos/fiestin/sets/72157651829362420/
soon my video (tomorrow). and here is a link to the research note I posted back then: http://publiclab.org/notes/hagitkeysar/06-26-2013/info-activsts-on-a-boat-lake-orta-italy
