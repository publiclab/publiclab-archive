Hi [@dldisha](/profile/dldisha) I saw that the image of the all posts page seems to be similar to the image from this proposal: https://publiclab.org/notes/ruthnwaiganjo/10-26-2020/outreachy-winter-proposal-new-dashboard-implementation-project

Where did the image come from? If you are using an image from another proposal, please attribute where it came from to give proper credit. My apologies in advance if I'm mistaken. Thank you!
