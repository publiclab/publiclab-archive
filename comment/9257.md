Chris - I want to test to see how well calibration transfers between cameras and also between different camera settings and incident light (clear vs overcast). I expect NDVI will deal with those variations somewhat but testing will give a sense of how well. For best results you would want to take an photo of a calibration target before each mission so you could calibrate for a specific camera, settings and incident light. I think each white balance will require it's own calibration. I'm trying to work out logic to make that a simple process but progress is slow.
