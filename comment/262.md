I downloaded it but cannot seem to do anything with the app in the simulator. It has been a long time and I have forgotten how the provisioning process works with xcode for building to the device instead of the simulator. It may require a ios dev account or team membership with an active account as well. 

Shannon, I don't own the camera adaptor but I have used it several times and seems to work well. The usb one unofficially lets you use usb keyboards, just plug it in and it works if you want to do lots of typing. It should be included but there are worse gadget accessories offenses out there with the $30usd for 2 adaptors. Dropbox is helpful for this too, images can be saved to the device if need be or kept on the web.
