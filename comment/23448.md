 Nice proposal Getty! I liked that you included creating FTOs in your timeline. We would love if you try to open some FTOs now for newcomers, and help them in completing them too.

Regarding the testing part and re-organizing the timeline, you can refer to https://publiclab.org/notes/lekhidugtal/03-23-2019/soc-proposal-enhancing-the-ui-of-publiclab-and-relevant-changes-to-server#c23398 

Although, changing the timeline is necessary.

Thanks!
