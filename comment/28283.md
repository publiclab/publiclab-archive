You've got to be careful with lasers. The visible lines are often not their main emission lines. For instance a green laser (532 nm) puts out more energy in the infrared with lines at 808 nm and around 1200 nm.
LEDs often have a fairly broad output of about 30 nm and the peak wavelength has some variability (about 5 nm) within the same batch.
I normally use didymium glass for calibration (it has several sharp peaks through UV - vis-IR ). It is somewhat expensive, but maybe you could pick up some a little cheaper by looking for "glass blowing spectacles" which are made of didymium glass.
