Thanks! It looks like khufkens predicted the response from >700 as the data was not yet available. If you look at the spectrum published by Sony, it's actually higher than the prediction at 800nm, especially in the B pixel, which is great.

Regular LED sources would work. If I ever measure a dimmable LED source that uses pulse width modulation for dimming then flickering could become an issue. 

So I guess for everyone doing absorptance measurements halogen or non-dimming LED sources then banding should never be an issue. Even for calibrating with fluorescent lights, if there is flicker it shouldn't be a big issue since it's only being used for wavelength calibration, so intensity is irrelevant.

Phew, I had myself worried there but it seems like banding won't be a major issue.
