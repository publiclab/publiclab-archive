I may be really off base here so play nice if I am.

What sort of literature search has occurred regarding peak detection?  I did a search and immediately found [this](http://basic.northwestern.edu/publications/peakdetection/).  I just suspect that there are a lot of other resources available that are useable.  This area of research is broadly applicable and thus there has been a lot of work done on it.
