Thank you for sharing your workshop design--it is very strategic where there are many stakeholder groups who can come together around a shared project. I appreciate how you articulated your goals, one of which was to "build a local community of balloon mappers", and how already there are plans for more aerial mapping by a local anti-fracking activist group. 

I also have a question for you: do you see the laboratoriopublico list as a global list in Spanish language, or geographically specific to spain?
