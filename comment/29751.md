You know, getting a couple of these that could be "disposable" might not be a bad idea.  Working with 400 volts isn't a terribly high voltage, but it's still high enough to let the smoke out of parts (i.e. Kill them).  It looks like the operating voltage is about 400V.  I'm old school and would try it with either a step up transformer or a 120v transformer and a voltage multiplier.  High voltage Electrolytic capacitors are getting kind of hard to find these days.  But there are ways around it.  Caps in series with resistors across them.  Sorry, I'm old school.  How is the new approach to the problem?  Thanks and regards.
