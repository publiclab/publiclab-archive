The Public Lab store also offers diffraction grating as an option when purchasing lego spectrometers. The grating that we carry is also 1000 lines/mm, [here's where we source it from](https://www.rainbowsymphonystore.com/products/diffraction-grating-rolls). You can order the diffraction grating with [lego spectrometers](https://store.publiclab.org/collections/spring-2020/products/lego-spectrometer-kit?variant=8187504787563) (shoot us an email at [kits@publiclab.org](mailto:kits@publiclab.org)) or [as an add on](https://store.publiclab.org/products/lego-accessories?variant=14671323660397) so that you have CDs and diffraction grating.
