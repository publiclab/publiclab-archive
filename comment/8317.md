Hi, I've also recently posted a research note on NDVI and wratten25 on a cmos sensor. Eventually I got my best results by underexposing slightly and then not stretching the color band. It would be interesting how an image would look on your camera that's slightly underexposed and doesn't stretch the color band. Would you be able to post such an image for comparison?
