Hi [@Johudson1](/profile/Johudson1) -

I am very interested in this topic as well.  Did you get any response regarding lab space or other interested parties to help conduct research?  It seems like there was a flurry of news about the fungi when it was found in 2011, but since then there has been practically nothing about the progress of the research as it applies to our plastic problem.  I'm hoping for an update as to how viable an option it really is.  Is anyone currently conducting research? Has anyone invested in any technology?  Any info you can shoot back to me would be great.

Thanks!
