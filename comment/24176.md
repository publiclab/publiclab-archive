[@warren](/profile/warren) I was so excited about brainstorming on this on the phone and totally left out why - back in school I did some consulting for an organization, **Open4Definition**. They've been running decades of research on --- creating the perfect name. (or as they more formally put it, "unlocking the latent power behind behavioral definitions"). 
They provide services to socially-oriented organizations to innovate behavioral definitions that influence positive social behavior and have the potential to spread. 

Think like, "go green", "designated driver", "agile development" (as you mentioned), even ["open source"](http://open4definition.org/keystone.php)

Their mission statement is definitely idiosyncratic, but I feel like it would be cool to try out for PL's workflow. Going to brainstorm on my own for a bit and then probably reach out to them to catch up and for advice! 

What are your thoughts on this idea?
