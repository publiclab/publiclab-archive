Yes, you can upload those images directly to [Spectral Workbench](https://spectralworkbench.org). To upload your image, press the arrow next to "Capture Spectra" on the upper right-hand corner of Spectral Workbench to bring up the drop-down menu and select "Upload Image". Once you've added your image there the software will create a plot based on the image.
