 If this thread is still valid, the edge-detect module is going to change soon. In the PR https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/pull/771 , significant changes will be made to the module. If someone wants to use the module currently, they can clone the fork where this change is hosted https://github.com/HarshKhandeparkar/image-sequencer . The branch name is 'complete-edge-detect' https://github.com/HarshKhandeparkar/image-sequencer/tree/complete-edge-detect?files=1 . I will post a sample output image in this answer. 
I hope this helps.
