Bob, this is a great idea. A secret admirer sent me one of these and I was very excited. I didn't know that any mortal could order them for only $3.95 (+$5.95 shipping). The pieces of filter are 3 x 1.25 inches, plenty big to convert many PowerShots, and apparently you get almost all of the Rosco colors. Each one has a little sheet of paper with the name and spectral curve on it. The samples are cut from their full sized filter sheets which have the filter name printed on one edge. So there is a small probability that each sample will have part of a printed name on it, making it less suitable for our purposes. This adds to the excitement when you receive your swatch book and flip through it looking for that one color you really want to use.

There is similar gambling involved in ordering antique Wratten filters on ebay. I could not resist buying a lot of five filters for $10 (incl shipping) which included [#15](/n/15) and [#25](/n/25)A. But both filters arrived well used and scratched just enough to make them unsuitable for internal camera installation. They would be fine for taping in front of a lens, because then the filter ends up getting scratched anyway. I ordered another Wratten [#15](/n/15) that was supposed to be unopened (and cost almost 4X more than the whole lot of used ones). The seller then noticed that the seal had been broken, so he refunded the shipping cost. Still waiting to see how "new" it is.
