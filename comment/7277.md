For an after dark flight you might want:

* the highest ISO available
* Manual exposure with a slow shutter (maybe 1/160 second) and widest aperture, OR
* Shutter priority with a slow (ca. 1/160 second) shutter (via CHDK)
* Fixed focus on infinity (the camera will not be able to find anything to autofocus on)

The all black photos will be a problem to stitch or assign to even a general area. The higher you fly the fewer photos there will be without any lights in them.

In advance of the flight, take the camera out after dark sometime and see what it can capture on campus using different settings.

For a late afternoon flight that continues until after dark, the exposure settings are problematical.
