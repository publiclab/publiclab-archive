Thanks; interesting thoughts. Yes, digital cameras can have white balance settings which create a general shift in the RGB output ratios, but the SWB interface does not have that sophistication. SWB therefore has the same interface settings for all Sanm cameras -- whatever that actual color temp might be -- the specs on the Sanm device are sketchy about that. The sunlight reference curve is "smooth" compared with professional-grade plots which show more detail -- but that "detail" results from spectral "absorption holes" which are too narrow for simple digital camera spectrometers to detect. The webcam is, in fact, quite noisy where the sensitivity is low (like the ends of the detectable bandwidth) so that data really is just noise, not real signal data. There is no way to create a gain-correction based on noise so it is better to use reference data with similar detection bandwidth to the hardware being corrected. An incandescent light bulb also has a relatively "smooth" spectrum but it's hard to find light bulbs where you have the actual spectral curve of it's specific temperature. There's lots more very accurate data for the sun.
