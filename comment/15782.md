Hi Mario,  
White balance could be a problem. All of those preset white balance settings and the results from auto white balance will be very different from the results if a custom white balance is done as described [here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/infrablue-white-balance).

If the camera can save camera raw files, they can be white balanced after they are taken. If only jpegs can be saved, then it is difficult to get good NDVI results without custom white balance.

Here is the histogram of foliage in your photo:

[![0010Hist.JPG](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/018/729/large/0010Hist.JPG)](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/018/729/original/0010Hist.JPG)  
Note that there is not much difference between the values in the red and blue (NIR) channels.

Here is the histogram for foliage in a photo which can be directly converted to NDVI ([from this note](https://publiclab.org/notes/Claytonb/08-13-2016/plant-health-ndvi-white-balance)): 

[![0554Hist.JPG](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/018/730/large/0554Hist.JPG)](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/018/730/original/0554Hist.JPG)  
Note that the blue (NIR) values are about eight times larger than the red values. 

To convert your photo into a photo that can be converted to NDVI, you could try to adjust the color balance so foliage was a blue like in the photo above. I have never had much success doing this. The NDVI image is never as meaningful as when a proper custom white balance is set before the photos are taken. You might be able to find a clever way to do it.
