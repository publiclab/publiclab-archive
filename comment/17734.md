Just to clarify here, I believe to sum up we can say that: 

IF a reagent reacts linearly (for example, if doubling the concentration of the thing the reagent reacts to DOUBLES the opacity of the reagent)

...then YES, you can use the principle of Beer's Law to determine concentration of what the reagent is reacting to.
