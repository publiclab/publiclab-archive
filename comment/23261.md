Actually i wondered re: [@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro)'s note on `might risk suspending dust from the growth medium in the air` if, and this is weird, but putting a filter over the plant container top could help at all? Like, some plants grow through an X cut in a fabric sheet. I just wondered about if putting such a cover would reduce the risk of growth medium dust getting blown around.

In general, I'd think the dust might get tamped down by the water, thinking of how construction sites sometimes spray water to tamp down the dust. But not sure - maybe that's pretty cursory and doesn't even work well.
