Do you have experience trying to trim them, or using tails? I haven't had a Delta crash like this one did. I haven't checked the KAP forums for tips yet. 

It just leaned over and dove to the ground.The juice bottle did the trick. Even landing on the asphalt parking lot, while the camera was tilted in the bottle, it was still shooting and none the worse for wear.
