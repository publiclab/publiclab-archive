Hmmm. Well, I'd agree the above image seems "fuzzy" but I'm also not clear as to what light the spectrum is representing. It also looks very over-exposed and I'd guess the RGB channels are all clipping.

Try this first: Place a CFL source 6-10 feet away, adjust the 'line' (up/dn) for capturing the pixel data near the spectral band center, set the spectrometer orientation (or adjust the distance to the CFL) such that none of the RGB channels have clipping. You should be able to resolve a narrow double-peak for the middle green peak. If the peaks are clearly visible but also rather broad (not a sharp green peak) then it might be focus, but it also might be the slit or slit width. I use a 0.45mm slit width in my PLab Proto V3.

If you're really having trouble with the camera's actual focus, you may need to open the spectrometer, move the diffraction grating (DVD) (or the camera) out of the way, point the camera at something with detail (a photo, paper with text, etc.) and look at the camera's image with everything under normal room light. You should be able to find the approximate lens focus fairly easily -- it will not be a very precise focus (about 1-2 in DOF) but. Mine is at about 6 in (150mm). Hope this helps.
