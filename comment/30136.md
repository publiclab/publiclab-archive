Hello [@cess](/profile/cess). I am very happy to know that you liked the proposal!! Thank You soo much for all the appreciation. üòä‚ù§Ô∏è

Yes, I admit that the shade of blue is too dark to be used as a bg color, and in other sections as well.
 Since I have made these designs using Figma so there were few options available to play with colors. But we could easily apply any shade of colors when we will implement the designs using bootstrap and amazing features of CSS like background-blend-mode, rgb values of color, mix-blend-mode and a lot more.

Thank you so much for providing valuable feedback üíñ
