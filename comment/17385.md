The folks at San Francisco Estuary Institute (www.sfei.org) may be able to point you in the direction of a company or research group that may test unknown substances. Also, I don't have have any experience with this lab, but Torrent Lab looks to be pretty versatile: http://www.torrentlab.com/torrent/Home/LaboratoryCapabilities/EnvironmentalAnalysisServices/Water&Soil.html.
