I have not heard of anyone using a microcontroller (Arduino or ESP board) to read data from an SD card. But maybe it is possible. A more common strategy is for a microcontroller (ESP board) to read sensor data and send it immediately via Bluetooth or WiFi. At the same time (every time the sensor is read) the data can be written to SD card. So all the data are stored on the SD card and whenever a Bluetooth or WiFi device is nearby the live data stream can be monitored.
