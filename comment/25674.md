Hello [@super_smartaga](/profile/super_smartaga) , 
Thanks for writing! I'll suggest two starting points: 
1. watch the video on https://spectralworkbench.org/
2. investigate the methods for building this spectrometer out of legos, as i believe it is currently the best performing as well as lowest-cost, accessible design: https://publiclab.org/w/lego-spectrometer
