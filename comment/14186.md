Sounds like I will have an "illuminating evening" tonight (as long as no model girls come along and tear my clothes off...). I don't have a Solux lamp (I'm not sure this brand is sold here in Germany) but I might try some different lamp types over the proposed 2 hours in 5 min steps during the next days. Will get back with the results as they come in.
