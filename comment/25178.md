Ok, I'm sorry this is taking so long. I found some command line instructions for Mac OS, the basic issue is that the partition is in a format (ext I think) that Mac and Windows don't read by default. I think maybe we need to work this problem at the pi-builder level, if only by making the images downloadable more directly over WiFi, but for now I'll share some links to try to get your photos off quickly.

This may be an alternative on Windows: https://www.howtogeek.com/112888/3-ways-to-access-your-linux-partitions-from-windows/

I wish there were a relatively plug and play way to mount an Ext filesystem on a Mac. It seems kind of ridiculous for people to use filesystems that aren't compatible. Maybe we can ask [@icarito](/profile/icarito) if there is a way around this... I'll open a question?
