thank you for the reply [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) 

Your reasoning regarding the chlorophyll's performance under water stress sounds reasonable.  "_It seems that your results are in agreement with previous research. NDVI is generally not expected to reveal water stress before plants wilt._" Could you possibly point me to some literature regarding this? I find it interesting that the values appeared to be higher (although not significantly) in the stressed plants, and I probably have to try to describe it somehow in the discussion.
__
In hindsight, I suppose a more suitable stress treatment which clearly disrupts the chlorophyll machinery, e.g. salt stress or nutrient deficiency/surplus would've revealed the differences better, and in a more "expected" manner.

A. Calibration or custom white balance?
- Yes, it seems that I did do both white balance adjustment and calibration. Before the experiments, I set the gain settings for red and NIR in the camera in such a way that produced nice looking NDVI-images. I then captured an image with the items mentioned previously (white printing paper, red folder and matte black paint) under the same illumination and used it in calculating the coefficients required for the nedhorning's NDVI-processing script. However, I did also capture images of the same scene under only red and NIR light as well. Should I use them to calculate the coefficients instead? Maybe I misunderstood some parts of the procedure.

***EDIT: something just clicked in my head and I think I now understand what you meant with capturing RAW-images and not using white balance adjustment. At the time these images were captured I wasn't aware that the RPi camera module was capable of handling RAW images ...

B. How much NIR does the camera capture?
- The peak wavelenghts were measured using two separate spectrometers, because the other wasn't able to record in the VIS spectrum, and the other in the NIR, respectively. I have the files in csv-format, but I'm not sure if they include the relative intensity of the measured channels. Is it somehow possible to calculate the intensity?

- One confession about the rosco-transmission graph which I forgot to mention: values represented with the dashed line (above 740nm) are indeed an estimate of the transmission, and the true transmission can be anything. I will reconsider using these estimates in the final version, as they are not really valid.
