That will be an interesting project to make a 5v Pro Mini data logger. I guess it will also include a 5v microSD module (the ones in the Mini Pearl Logger Kits are 3v). 

I was using a 9v battery for that Nano-based logger because it included a [Modern Device wind sensor](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/08-12-2017/winds-aloft-less-noise) which requires 8v. There is generally no good reason to use 9v batteries for this type of logger unless you need more voltage than the main board needs. Powering a 5v Pro Mini will probably work well with four alkaline batteries (4 x 1.5 = 6v) or six NiMH (6 x 1.2 = 7.2v).
