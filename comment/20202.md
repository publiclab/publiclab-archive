Question for [@Schroyer](/profile/Schroyer) , [@Willie](/profile/Willie) , [@imvec](/profile/imvec) , [@nanocastro](/profile/nanocastro) , [@jefffalk](/profile/jefffalk) or anyone else who is able to answer this question - I understand that the Shinyei sensor must be placed vertically such that the chrome tube has a 'northwest' orientation. Are there important considerations for the housing of this sensor and the other electronics? Does the shinyei sensor need to be open to the air? Does it only need to be partially exposed? Should it be entirely closed to the air in a solid and opaque container?

Any and all help appreciated
