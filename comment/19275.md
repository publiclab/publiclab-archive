Hi, this is tremendous, we'd love one at the Kits initiative! Could we trade you for some Lego parts? We're curious if you'd be interested in using the design files up at http://PublicLab.org/lego to offer an alternative mount compatible with the Lego design -- I think I mentioned to you but we'd love to encourage a "standard" attachment point. 

I think it could also pair nicely with the magnet connectors because the pins could "index" the connector and the magnets could actually hold it on. 

We're at:

Public Lab
55 Cromwell St 1D
Providence RI 02907

If you send us one, we'll ship a LEGO kit right back to you. Thanks!
