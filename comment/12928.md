There is a paper online "Natural Sorbents in Oil Spill Cleanup" by Hyung-Mln Chol - accessible here:  http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rinn_Cloud/publication/231275979_Natural_sorbents_in_oil_spill_cleanup/links/004635365433b21a25000000.pdf

There is another paper that might be interesting but I cannot find free access - will try later: "Detection of trace amounts of oil in sea water by fluorescence spectroscopy" by P. D. Keizer, D. C. Gordon Jr.  http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f73-175
