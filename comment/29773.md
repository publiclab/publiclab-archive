My field trip experience was intriguing. The environment of the location was the complete opposite of what I thought it would be. Plastics can take anywhere from 20 to 500 years to decompose. Plastics that I encountered were plastic cups, water bottles, and plastic bags. They all have a different span of time that it takes for them to decompose. It takes 450 years for the water bottles to decompose, 20 years for the plastic cups, and 1000 years for the plastic bags. These plastics get into our waterways and filtering systems. This causes microplastics to pollute our drinking water and food.
