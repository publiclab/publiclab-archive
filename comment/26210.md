We take two different samples: one sample is used for local chemistry analysis (alkalinity, pH, hardness, ...). That sample is collected typically in a 1L bottle (e.g. nalgene), but can even be taken in a bucket off a bridge and transferred to 1L bottle.  Again, this is used for local analysis.  The samples we send off to a professional lab are in 60mL bottles and are usually used for metals analysis.  I think the latter is more appropriate for the subject of this discussion.  Each bottle is individually labeled and there is a chain of custody form completed for each sample, listing who/what/where/when for each bottle, that we keep locally. We get our supplies from the Colorado Parks and Wildlife, but they look like these:

I didn't look very hard and there must be cheaper alternatives. Hope that helps. Dave
