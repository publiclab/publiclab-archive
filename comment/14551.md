Hmmm ... remember that the jpeg data is derived from MANY pixels which were run thoguht demosaicing from the RGGB filtered data, so unless you had 'raw' and the Bayer layout, there's no way of extracting anything which relates to the RGGB pattern. RGB greyscale weighting only helps with making nicer visual grey images and is of no help (improvement) in extracting the spectra's gain profile. The best I think you can do with the webcam is with the various techniques I've extracted in my series of 'noise and stability' notes.
