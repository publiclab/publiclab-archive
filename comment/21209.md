Hi.  Given that you mention "silica" and you are at UW Eau Claire ( western wisconsin sand mining...) I take your question to really ask whether one can assume the purpleair monitor can accurately count silica particulate, or another way to ask this is whether the concentrations recorded by purpleair data would include silica particulate?   I don't see any reason why it wouldn't. But purpleair is an inexpensive particulate monitor designed for general purpose monitoring. Since silica in general is found in very low concentrations except in unique situations I would doubt purpleair designers gave any thought to silica in particular. And if one wanted to use such a monitor in a very unique situation for a unique purpose you would have to do your own work to determine its appropriateness.  I believe the work needed to do this would be very complex and expensive. Ask yourself how silica concentration is usually determined and how you might integrate that to answer your question.
