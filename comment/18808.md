I suspect there are two issues here: 1) the software interface and 2) mechanical instability. On [#1](/n/1), I believe the web-based software always needs to 're-zero' where to take the single-line of image data within the video frame. On [#2](/n/2), assuming you are using the paper-and-velcro PLab spectrometer, there simply is not sufficient mechanical rigidity in the design to provide the repeatability you require. (Might be helpful: https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/03-02-2015/plab-3-spectrometer-upgrade-prototype )
