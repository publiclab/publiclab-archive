Hello [@priyaraj_17](/profile/priyaraj_17), thank you so much for your proposal. I really appreciate your time and I especially enjoyed the timeline design you've shown. I think we would have liked to see a little more digging into the existing code base to show where changes (such as autocompletion) would be made. If you need help finding a specific line of code or area of the code, you can always ask and the more specific the better, i.e. "where can I find the code that drives the autocompletion system?" or something like that.

We also highly value applicants' engagement in welcoming newcomers, providing peer support and encouragement, and generally working cooperatively in our community. We always love seeing when people have created "first-timers-only" issues for others at code.publiclab.org as well.

Thanks so much for your time and energy! Please know you're welcome to reapply and of course to contribute more as you're able to!
