The Beer-Lambert law primarily states there is a relationship between attenuation and wavelength of light through a substance. The attenuation is linear with path length through a uniform substance. If the attenuation is small and the signal level is high, then the spectrometer will have a better SNR (signal to noise ratio) and RELATIVE measurements are possible. Absolute measurements require sensitivity calibration over the detection wavelength range -- SWB does not yet do this.

Assuming just relative measurements, it is best to 1) provide a stable, broadband light source (Solux 4700K halogen for eg.), 2) no room light as that is hard to control and 3) set the max non-clipped signal level to handle the lowest attenuation configuration. You are then left with the sensitivity range for measurement defined by the spectral curve you observe over the typical range of the spectrometer (eg: 400-650nm).
