I can help with analyzing microscopic plastic particles, but not microplastics. Let's start with most expensive and go to least expensive.

For R&D, we used a liquid nitrogen cooled microscope FTIR with ATR accessory.  The ATR might not be needed.  It did pretty well, although black samples could give problems.  Cost, with libraries, was about $100 k.  It would easily handle particles smaller than 5 mm.

You might be able to get by with a standard diamond cell FTIR.  These are much less expensive, but still would run in the tens of thousands of dollars.  The 5 mm range particle size is something you would want to try before buying.

Polarized light microscopy is another techique.  Less expensive, but it takes a fair amount of operator expertese.  Don't know if it works on all plastics. 

This will give you some places to start investigating.  Please come back with any questions.
