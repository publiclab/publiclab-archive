[@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) glad to hear it has been considered! I studied some psychology in college, I learned that if there's anyone who knows how to craft a survey, it's an academic psychologist. There will be unavoidable effects, of course, but as long as you've got someone on the team (or at least consulted with someone) who knows how to deal with that sort of stuff, I'm pacified :)
