I'm not familiar with the KnowFlow, but I would not expect there to be much overlap in the sketches which are typically used to run the two devices. 

The Riffle is designed as a standalone datalogger which operates unattended for days or months. I think the KnowFlow is intended to be used manually to make individual measurements. So the entire structure of the code running the two devices would be quite different.

Each environmental sensor generally requires a specific library of functions, so unless each device had the same sensors attached the code to collect data from sensors would be substantially different.
