I've learned a few more things from my online activities. 

It was paper towel that the Hong Kong University found to be effective.  They took different household material and looked at them with electronic microscope.  They found the pore size of paper towel similar to a surgical mask, so they concluded that it's effective as surgical mask. 

Of course, they looked at a hongkongese paper towel.  Here in the U.S. , there are several brands and I'm sure the breathability and pore size vary.
