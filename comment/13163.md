Hi Warren, I am really trying to make the device sa cheap as possible. I my first trials Ia used a REBEL T3 with its default lens (about US$ 400 in total) but a long time of exposure is required (about 300 s) and the spectra are not so nice. Also in first trials a piece of DVD (just the metallized side, washed with alcohol to eleiminate the ftalocianine painting) was used and it works but the alignment is really a headache. Filters were bought at Edmund Optics and a cheap OD4 edge filter centered at 550 nm works fine but only from about 600 (1/cm). About the cheap green laser it has several (non wanted) secondary lines which dirt the Raman spectra and these lines are so intense that are still present after one cleaning filter.

Please do not hesitate in contact me for any further explanation / clarification / discussion, etc.

Regards,

Eduardo.
