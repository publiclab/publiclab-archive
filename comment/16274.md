Hi, all -- just a note, after speaking with some potential RGSoC applicants (and I'm happy to get on Skype with folks if it's helpful, please feel free to ask) -- 

RGSoC's official application is directly to the RGSoC organization, through [their website](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students/application/). But we would like all RGSoC applicants to post a proposal here as well, because:

* we will review proposals here in looking over applications and indicating our preferences to to RGSoC folks between March 18-22
* we think it's great to have a dialogue with teams
* we'd like to know specifically about your planning process in tackling a project or set of projects
* we're friendly!

Thank you!
