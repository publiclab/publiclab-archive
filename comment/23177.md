Both of the examples you link to are over exposed. The over exposure is clipping off the sharp peaks in the spectrum. You can tell if your spectra are over exposed by looking for over saturated colours that appear to be approaching white. Also Spectral Workbench shows where the individual R,G and B outputs are clipping at the top of the display. The simplest way to reduce over exposure is to increase the distance between your Spectrometer and the light source.
