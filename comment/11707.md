Mathew:  That sounds like a mechanical engineer (which I am not) question.  I SUSPECT that it will be the sum of the restrictions because of the low pressure we need.

Nick:  I am also not a glass expert.  My thinking is that the breaking of glass should happen soon after scoring.  The reason is that glass heals.  Aged scores would probably result in breaks that would be either hard to accomplish or not consistent in shape.  But again, I am not a glass expert.
