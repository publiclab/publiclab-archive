The camera does not know the color of the light that hits a pixel on the sensor. If more photons hit the pixels linked to the red channel than pixels linked to the blue channel, the camera will produce a reddish color. In this case, if the only light hitting the red channel pixels is NIR, the camera will still produce a red color.

Standard computations of NDVI assume that the light illuminating the scene is similar to sunlight in that it  has a similar proportion of VIS (blue or red) light to NIR light. NDVI cannot be reliably computed on indoor photos unless the light has a spectral balance of VIS and NIR similar to sunlight.
