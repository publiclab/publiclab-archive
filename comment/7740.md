Hi all,

its teh first time I post here and I am thinking about shooting with a balloon over the coast line here in Melbourne. The idea is first do it locally (since I live close to the water) and then go to dif cities in around Victoria). I am planning to shoot with a a sony rx-100 mII attached to a balloon..  which takes me straight to my question: Is there a way to use some settings or some sort of wireless remote control with this camera? Thanks 
Marcelo
