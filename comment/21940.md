It's good you discovered that. Yesterday I started to write about the need to subtract the blue band (NIR) from the red band (red + NIR) so you get a better representation of red reflectance in the red band but deleted it since I thought you had already done the subtraction. 

My understanding is that for most camera sensors the red channel is a little more sensitive to NIR than the blue channel so you can apply  a small offset if you find that but in your case it might not be necessary.
