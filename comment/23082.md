I just found that you can use a webcam with any Android phone using an adapter -- https://www.amazon.com/CHENYANG-Ultra-Adapter-Connector-Tablet/dp/B015GZOHKW/

That means old Android smartphones can be used as part of a microscope -- see [#microscopes](/tag/microscopes) -- that's built on a webcam. We'd love to use them if they're usable Android devices -- how many do you have? What part of the country are you in?
