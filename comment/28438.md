Hi [@barun1024](/profile/barun1024), thanks so much for sharing your ideas. I like the extra explanations you have added for each item. I have a couple of questions/feedback:

1. You have a section called _other refinements_ since they are part of the project, I would recommend expounding further on them as you have in the other features.

2. I did not see these two features mentioned in the proposal: _Develop ideas and prototypes for how to ensure “important” or expected content is surfaced_
and _Ranking by recency, views - brainstorm with community reps_

3. What are some of the tests you will include in the project? Unit, functional, system.

4. Are there any accessibility features you can think about in the project?

5. Any plans to make First Timer Issues as you work on your project? We appreciate issues that invite newcomers to Public Lab.


Thanks again for your contributions to Public Lab and it's amazing to see the work you have done in the Open Source community.
