hi [@tmclean1](/profile/tmclean1) !!  I think I remember you saying these weren't algae bloom lines in the water, but maybe something else? I can't remember what you said, can you remind me? we're having a conversation about this in a thread here: https://publiclab.org/questions/stevie/08-14-2018/what-are-ways-to-monitor-algae-blooms#answer-comment-20393
