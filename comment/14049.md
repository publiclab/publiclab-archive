It seems that the Mobius timelapse features could be all you need to capture turbidity events. Depending on the stream or river, turbidity events caused by rain events generally last for hours if not days. So having the Mobius take a photo every hour could be sufficient to capture these events. That could produce just a dozen photos per day. It would not be necessary to sort them to find turbidity events if the Riffle was recording when they occurred. And sorting through 1000 photos might be one of the easier parts of the whole process of documenting the events.

There might be other types of turbidity events that are short lived, so more frequent photos could be required. But is the general idea that the Riffle results would be the data and the photos would be for PR and supporting evidence? Or will you be leaning on the photos to be data?
