The difference between deposition & sublimation are the reverse process of a gas going to a solid is known as deposition, the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas state, without passing through the liquid state is known as sublimation. 

Sublimation: When water vapor in the air changes into liquid water 
Endothermic  

Deposition: laying down of sediment carried by wind, flowing water, the sea or ice. 
Exothermic
