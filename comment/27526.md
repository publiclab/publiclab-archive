Hi! Thank you this is looking very cool! So you are mentioning API calls, do you anticipate building the dashboard from separate calls, rather than using the original controller request to assemble the data for display in the template? https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/main/app/controllers/home_controller.rb#L34

Very interested in hearing more about this with regard to your imagined architecture, thank you for your proposal!
