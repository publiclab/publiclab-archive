Sean,

the answer is no.  in this case, we couldn't get the camera high enough in the amount of time we had, with the amount of wind we had. 

obliques we got as a way to salvage the day. 

i have thoughts on ways to make obliques work.  Those thoughts have a lot to do with Cropping the photo!  in areas that will be stretched beyond all hope.
