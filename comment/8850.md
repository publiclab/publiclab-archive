[@dippind](/profile/dippind) , thanks for your response. Talking to update we are now in the process of integrating those hardware parts i.e microcontroller,  sensors and GSM/GPRS shield in a single system so that we can reduce the price drastically in comparison to isolated hardware modules. Our designing part is almost on the way..within two days we may finish the designing and simulation. Also, we are working in website and we will be informing you shortly.
Your's faithfully,
Cool It team
