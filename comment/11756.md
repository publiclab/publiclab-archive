Good point, I might use this approach to see if I can get better results on my PRI sensor. Things were funky and this offset in response (difference in transmission of the filters + spectral response) is probably the cause and something I need to address. I'm still working on the full spectral response of the raspberry pi but for now this has taken a back seat.
