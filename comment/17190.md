It will be important to modify your two camera system so the photo pairs capture the same scene. It will also be important to align the two photos so they overlap perfectly using something like a SIFT algorithm.

It is not possible to evaluate the NDVI results from the photo pair you posted from the internet (without attribution) because there is no key to the colors. 

Using a single camera system will eliminate the problem of aligning two photos but will introduce another problem which is that it is impossible to get both red and NIR channels which are not contaminated with other wavelengths.
