Yes, i'm aware of the technologies.
I want to develop a sensor, using NIR spectometry to measure the moisture level and characterize wood chips.

Like this comercial sensor: http://www.moisttech.com/wood-moisture/
0.1% to 0.5% of accuracy.

How to achieve some similar result and where i start ?
