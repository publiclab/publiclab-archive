My initial thought was an electromagnet might be best. Reading the journal though, they use two small neodymium magnets. 
The major issue with rough design I am having is an efficient way of drawing air through, I'm thinking maybe a design like a slide whistle or bike pump may work well for drawing in the air, but placing detectors then becomes a challenge.
Looking at the article you linked, we could use PLM really cheaply and effectively using a cheap microscope and a polariser. The other 2 are unfeasible, since the aim is for a quick, cheap method that anyone can use. The main issue with using a microscopy method also is that it would be for settled particles.

It would be useful to see if PLM works for your tape method on some settled dust.

On an aside, it is unlikely that I will be able to do anything practical for a few months, because I have just finished studying and so any big build projects will need to wait until funds are available. Though I will pick up a microscope at some point soon, since I have just found out that USB microscopes aren't that expensive. 
In the meantime if you could (safely) collect some asbestos and test it via your method that would be great.
