Hi, [@bsugar](/profile/bsugar) -- thanks! We are working on this, and love your ideas. The current workflow we're trying is to encourage people to phrase their offers as questions, i.e. `Does anyone need X?` and requests also naturally make for questions.

We are also digging out offers and asks from the call transcripts and mailing lists (the [Gulf Coast list](/lists) and others) and reposting as questions on the [Harvey page](https://publiclab.org/wiki/harvey) This could be more clearly articulated as a task itself. 

Finally, we're "staging" draft offers and trying to get them queued up on the Harvey talk page: https://publiclab.org/talk/harvey

Then we are starting to do social media and list outreach as well as individual email connects to matchmake.

We are also `@mentioning` usernames to bring in more capacity that way.

We could /definitely/ use support/input/refinement of this process, as we have just put it together using available systems this week. It has similarities to slower coordination efforts we've attempted on PublicLab.org but is faster paced and more involved. We also have to exercise some judgement about what is appropriate and truly supportive of the groups we're hoping to help. 

Would you be able to join the next Open Call or discuss further - your ideas jive well with the first steps we've taken. Also happy to talk in the chatroom or here.
