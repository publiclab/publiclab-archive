I see what you mean.  The analysis I did was a PNA (polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon analysis).  It's closely related to PAHs. It's still listed on some of the carbon black info sheets.   It looks like everyone has switched to Gc-ms, instead of uv-vis. 

The method put carbon black in a cellulose soxhlet thimble with a filter on top, then extracted for 24 hours.  Sorry, but I don't remember the solvent we used. Then the solvent was filtered and scanned from 400 nm to 700 nm.  

We had a reference on file.  Since the plant closed, I can't pull that up to help you.  Sorry.
