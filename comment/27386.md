Looks like the zwettstein image  is NOAA 15 2020-09-12.  I have a capture of that pass, but it's noisy.  Aligning the time marks, it's interesting that both images have similar noise features, but offset by half a second(**correction: half a minute**):

Not "local" noise, since it's in both images; not noise in the satellite, since that would be synchronized on the time track to the left of the images.  So what is it?  Starlink interference?

Hour and a half later, NOAA 18 came up.  The land detail is nice:
