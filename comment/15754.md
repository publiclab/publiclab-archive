Yes - this could be achieved by using the more basic "inline notes grid" system mentioned on https://publiclab.org/wiki/power-tags#Inline+power+tags -- so if each resource were described in a research note tagged with, for example, `related-organizations` (or any other tag you think is appropriate), you could display a listing of all such notes by using the inline tag `[notes:related-organizations]` in a wiki page. Would that work for the use you're thinking of?
