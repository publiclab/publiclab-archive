Issue 3:  PLab 3.0 on Android:
I attempted to use SWB on a Galaxy S4 with the PLab 3.0 connected via the USB port -- which would allow using the PLab 3 remotely; nice idea. However, the interface refused to detect the PLab camera. Yes, smartphone code is much too hardware/firmware/release dependent but maybe ... it's a minor glitch? At least cam selection code is already there.
