Hello Dr. Summers, Thanks for getting back to me so soon.I followed your last instructions and tried 
compiling the Wheestat5_0 sketch.I got an error that referred to the fastdigitalwite.h and
fastdigitalwrite.cpp files located within the new SPI library from the stellarisiti forum.I went back
through the complete Wheestat5_0 sketch  you've written,and could not find any instance where this
library (fastdigitalwrite) is called.(the error simply states;board not supported).So I moved the two
files to the original SPI file(I re-named it OLDSPI),and then tried to complile the sketch; It compiled
successfully!Upon compiling,it shows a sketch size of 8,896 bytes; does that sound about right?
If so...it would appear that we're good to go.Please advise if I've commited some "digital sin" by
performing the actions above,otherwise,I'll assume for the time being,that I can move on to building
the hardware(I have 2 Stellaris Launchpad boards on the way;as well as 14-pin PDIP versions of the
digital pots.I already have a number of rail to rail opamps that can fill this projects requirements
nicely). Well, that's about it for now,again......thank's so very much for both your help and patience!
