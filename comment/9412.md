good work amy, I like the thinking.

I've had the optic fibre tactic on the backburner now for a while, I have the fibre, just need to work on a lens to make it all work. I have used the vernier labquest and spectrovis apparatus with a fibre cable and it adds a lot to the capability of the machine.

I'm not sure that using a filter is that useful in what you are describing though. The great ability of the spectroscope is to act as a filter itself, by spreading out the spectrum of a range of wavelengths spatially. If you want to filter, then you can simply chop off the sides of the display that you don't need. Putting a colour filter in would be needed if you have a simple photometer, say in AAS. The spectrometer gets around this by virtue of its design. Let me know if I have misunderstood your technique or if I'm being obtuse !

well done again
