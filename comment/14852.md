I like this; what about also photographing a GPS or taking a picture of an android device which is itself taking a picture of a watch (and gets the GPS stamp) or something like that -- a kind of "sync" like the clapping board to sync audio/video in film? Questions like this may be part of the project I'm going to be working on the next few months on evidence and authentication/chain of custody, so I'd love to share notes as we each progress.
