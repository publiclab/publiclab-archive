[@warren](/profile/warren), [@stoft](/profile/stoft), [@david-days](/profile/david-days), Hmmm...seems like there are instances where 2.0 is appropriate;

"Typically, scientific notation is used for this purpose. If 200 has two significant figures, then 2.0 x 102 is used. If it has three, then 2.00 x 102 is used. If it had four, then 200.0 is sufficient. See rule [#2](/n/2) above."
