I'm not positive it will work. My arduino kit came with a small photoresistor, pictured here.

I asked my advisor, Charlie Schweik to purchase an adafruit datalogger shield. Myself and my peer, Daniel Smoliga have soldered the datalogger shield onto my arduino using Daniel's solderer and materials in the UMass Amherst electrical engineering department. 
I'm planning on purchasing a tripod. I will research brownfields (open spaces that have been abandoned) in Springfield. I'm planning on purchasing a GPS shield to track where I collect data. I plan to go to these brownfields on sunny days, prop up my contraption onto the tripod and set it up in 4 corners of the brownfield. I will try to collect data for hours at a time and I plan to to collect data starting next month and ending in April. I will download data off of the datalogger and onto a computer and calibrate the readings it gives me. I will use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map out the brownfields and categorize them with colors that determine great, okay or bad for solar arrays.
