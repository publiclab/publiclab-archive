It looks like a single beam instrument was used for this work.  With a double beam instrument, there is no need for phrases like "OD435/OD415".  The reference beam takes care of most issues like that.  So measuring the absorbance at 435 nm is good enough.  But, with single beam, it doesn't always work that way.
