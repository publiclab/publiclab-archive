Do you have any information on your instrument, how you take the chlorophyll readings?  I see a good bit on how you are wanting to automate the data capture, but I didn't see a description of the fluorometer.
I volunteer with <a href="http://lmvp.org">LMVP</a> (Lakes of Missouri Volunteer Program), and they conduct water quality monitoring.  Their algae sampling is quite formal, where filtered, freeze-dried samples have the chlorophyll extracted and fluorometry is used to measure the chlorophyll.  While the collection and freeze-drying is done by the volunteers, the analysis is done at a lab.  I am interested in seeing what can be done on a local basis, with simple equipment.
Looking at <a href="http://www.ysi.com/media/pdfs/T606-The-Basics-of-Chlorophyll-Measurement.pdf">commercial probes</a>, I do not see that they are that far different from the desktop spectrometer.  LEDs in the 420-470 nm wavelength are easy to obtain.
Have you looked at anything in this direction?
