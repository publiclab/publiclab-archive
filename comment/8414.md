Thanks for your informative comment Chris.

Its interesting to know that you take still photos and later upload them to SWB. It would be great if we get to hear more about this, so even others can try it out!

Yes, there are chances that one or more channels may be overexposed. If only one channel is overexposed, say the value is 255, we can use the other two channels for peak detection purpose (as we know the pattern of how these blue, red and green bright lines should look in those particular non-overexposed channels). If more than one channel is overexposed, then we can alert the user to re-attempt with better exposure. I would like you to help me out to gather these overexposed spectrums from SWB database, so that I can come up with a better algorithm.

Also, how shall we go about giving a quality grade to the spectrum? Which dynamic range are we looking at for this purpose?
