> This lesson is part of a series of lessons designed for educators to facilitate student-led inquiry around environmental topics. If there are time constraints, this lesson can be split into two at the Elaborate portion of the lesson. During Phase I of this series, students work towards identifying and learning about environmental topics.

> \*Your students will need to stitch together the images using [MapKnitter](https://mapknitter.org). To learn more about how to stitch a map [check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=117&v=0h6MBH6f2js), or [visit this website](http://publiclab.org/wiki/mapknitter).

> **Check Out Your Maps**
> 
> Tape the large posters of their maps onto the wall. Be sure that there is space for students to gather around each map. Allow students time to view the large print-outs of the maps they created. Students should be encouraged to get up close to the maps and to write down their initial reactions to share.

> **Gallery Walk: Annotated Maps**
> 
> This can be done as one large groups or in multiple, smaller groups. To split into smaller groups, divide the map into smaller pieces, and assign each group a section of the map. Each group will annotate and present their share of the map. Splitting students into small groups can also work if your group has multiple study sites.
> 
> Post it notes and photos taken from the ground should be used to annotate the maps. For example, if a map doesn’t know an elevation change, write that down on the map. Students should add the notes from the Ground Observation Team as well as their own observations.
> 
> Ater annotating the maps, have students rotate to the different maps with their group, adding their comment as well. At each map, ask students to pay special attention to whether or not the annotated map they create answer the questions from their need-to-know charts.
> 
> Take Photos of their Annotated Maps to Share on Public Lab as a Project Update.

> ## Explain
> 
> **Time** : 15 minutes  Revisit Your Study Design
> 
> Take another look at the study design the students created before the mapping. Students should be asked to:  - Identify locations for sampling/photographs/monitoring.  - Encourage students to duplicate their monitoring efforts across multiple locations at the study site. For example, the depth of more than one puddle can be measured.  - Review the tools and methods they aren’t using. Do they seem more or less applicable now that they have a better understanding of the study site.  - Which methods will best allow the to answer their research questions.

> **Create a Workplan**
> 
> As a group, you’ll move from your study design to a workplan. For each method, you should determine:  - Where the monitoring will take place  - Who will perform the monitoring  - When and how often the monitoring will take place.

> Have students form pairs, and ask students to summarize their environmental study (what they’ll do and why they’re doing it) in under 60 seconds to another student acting as a member of your community. After summarizing, students should identify why the community member might find the project significant, spending no more than 2 minutes on the summary. Students then switch roles, with the former community member providing their summary.
