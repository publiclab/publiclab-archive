Chris,
I suspect there is more attenuation gradient to be gleaned from the images than first meets the eye (as there was more than I'd suspected in the one sample I picked). That said, yes, I think some optimization of the slit is possible and could easily enhance this effect. I build some stepped-slits (about 0.4" long and 6 steps from 8-20 mils). The theory was 3-dB steps but in practice (laser-photo-printed) were not so well defined. However, I think there is room for improvement. -Dave
