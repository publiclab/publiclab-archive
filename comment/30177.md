There's some work needed to modify this research protocol so it can be done in regions like Ohio that might not have the exact species listed in the paper. A good place to start is this [US Forest Service table](https://gis.nacse.org/lichenair/?page=e_sensitivity) that indicates lichen sensitivity to certain pollutants, and you can use it to get a sense of what lichens are most common in the region and how much they are impacted by pollutants
