I think that set still has error since some of the important band is still below the dim light area eg red if they are using the same light source and we can only minimize error as much as we could. Actually, I just cut off the important spectrum in the spectro to do analysis and discard the unwanted spectro bit due to the artifact of the lens of the camera. It does not mean that it recorded in a different angle. Currenly, it can only operate at 0 degree angel.But in the water part, the unwanted band cannot be cut off anymore. Besides,the pattern match the literature(pattern such as slightly blue/all have the same transmission are acceptable IN RESEARCH PURPOSE). It is still not diagnostic stage. Therefore, the data is validated. Therefore,it does not require to be the same run. And I don't know whether is due to the equipment only allows single run or due to other issue. By the way, i will redo the data set and will further test with different H2O XN time to determine the precision after a couple week(may be a couple of weeks since QC is very time consuming) later since my PCR tube has been broken ! Thx for your recommendation anyway.
