 Hi: It looks like you are using "Auto" mode when taking the photo. I don't have this camera but I found this web site that might help: https://support.usa.canon.com/kb/index?page=content&id=ART105422&cat=4254B&actp=LIST

You need to follow the instructions for setting a "Custom" white balance except instead of using the white piece of paper use the card that came with the kit. Once the custom white balance is set you need to make sure that the camera's white balance setting is set to "Custom" before taking a photo.
