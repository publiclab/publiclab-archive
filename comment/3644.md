Man, Chris, you really have the obscure references down -- i haven't seen ST:TMP for over a decade...

The reason I thought of just "smoothing" (more generically) was:

a) empirically that's what it does to the graph line
b) we could say vertical, but on live capture, the Y-axis is time, so there could be some confusion: what does "vertical" mean to the user?

We'd have to have a warning message that if your spectrum is curved or sheared, this won't work.

I'm hoping to finish up the macro saving system on the train this morning (quick round trip) and maybe I can try this as a first macro.
