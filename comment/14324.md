The camera is listed here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0#Parts+List

I think a B&W one would be great, but I really don't think they're sold anymore (at least not affordable ones). We're currently limiting to 640x480 capture resolution, but trying to remove that limitation: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/issues/104

This might also be addressed in the new Node.js library, as part of https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/issues/16

> Could I write Public Lab into a grant so that you get some grant money to do software development?

Well, that sounds really awesome, but I have to direct you to Becki Chall who leads our fundraising: https://publiclab.org/wiki/funding-partnerships-with-public-lab

Whether or not you do that, we can always use help to get the word out about our software platform and where folks can get involved to help drive it forward. There's a lot of info at https://publiclab.org/wiki/developers

Thanks!
