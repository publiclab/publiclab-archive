Yes,I see what you mean. Got a weird approach for the problem.  First, please become a little familiar with rtlsdr dongles by going to rtl-sdr.com.  The dongles cost about $25 and the article isbfrom tech minds ( Sept 1,2020). It talked about using an rtlsdr and an gps patch to decide gps signals.  It would also take a computer. But...  Might be a start.
