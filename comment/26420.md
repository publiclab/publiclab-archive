purple air is different now, you have to click the very obscure download link on the map page

They also discuss selecting an AOI on the map, but it's unclear how to do that.

How to access this tool
There are two ways you can view sensors in this list:
From the PurpleAir map, click the download button in the bottom right corner after selecting an area of interest.
Or click on a sensor on the PurpleAir map, then mouse over the 'Get this widget' link. A download link will then be displayed for that individual sensor.
For information on the data and the API's provided by PurpleAir, please see this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ijz94dXJ-YAZLi9iZ_RaBwrZ4KtYeCy08goGBwnbCU/edit?usp=sharing
