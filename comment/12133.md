This was brought up several times during the Barnraising also.  There were so many awesome people there with great ideas and lots to say, yet I haven't seen them on the Wiki.  So we are losing them somewhere.  Maybe it's not in the process of posting Research Notes; maybe it's in the process of actually just getting to them?  What I kept hearing was more along the lines of "I went to the site, I got overwhelmed/intimidated, I left the site"... I'm not sure they are even getting to the text editor part of it.  

Lurkers, I see you out there!  Feel free to chime in!
