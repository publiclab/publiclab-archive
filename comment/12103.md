Hi - I posted a link to a very cheap and tiny Arduino-compatible board called the Digispark, which could let you miniaturize everything - http://publiclab.org/notes/kgrevera/07-06-2015/cape-cod-thermal-fishing-bob-field-test#c12101 although it doesn't have enough pins for many thermistors unless you remove the LED -- but you might have to do that anyways if you're recording multiple inputs.
