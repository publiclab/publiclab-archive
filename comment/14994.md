###Improvements for next round:

* shorter tube for top piece, the length that connects to the top chopsticks. By shortening, will cut down weight, but also will cause legs to angle slightly out for better stance.  /----\ as opposed to |----|


* use smaller tubing for top pieces. Point chopsticks for legs in opposite direction: square, fat ends downward, thin ends upward. This will cut down on weight and hopefully improve strength of legs by putting mass where it's most needed.

* Add reinforcement in form of notch/zip-tie to connect top tube to the legs. Don't trust such a critical joint to friction alone.

* add a thin lanyard from camera directly up to the kite line for redundant safety reasons
