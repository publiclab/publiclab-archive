[@ebarry](/profile/ebarry) thanks.
[@warren](/profile/warren) thanks for reviewing my proposal. I want to list some further concerns :

1) ```we could just allow accounts to not have emails and just be sure whenever doing notifications that we check for email before sending```
Sorry I am not at all in favour of this because if a person forgets his password and unlinks twitter because he does not want to use Twitter to sign up anymore, this will result in inaccessibility of the account. Am I clear? What will happen to the forget password and reset password capabiltiy?
2) Prompt for username and email are good. this will result in asking the username password, email and username isnt it?? So, why not the user first registers and then links his account to twitter. 

Am I clear with linking and unlinking of providers to the user accout??
