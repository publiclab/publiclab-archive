Most of what's been shown on TV has been satellite photos and local photos.

For example, many photos were taken of China, as compared to a year previously. The differences were significant.

Likewise with photos of the sky through the l'arc de triumphe in France. The current picture showed a nice blue sky.  Pictures from a year ago were nasty grey.
