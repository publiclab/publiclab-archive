Hi, thank you for posting! This looks like a really interesting project; thanks for sharing. 

I wanted to ask for a clarification -- you mention that the project is open-source, but I went to download the plans, and saw a notice on https://humanetechnologies.co.uk/download-microbemeter/ that says:

`Download for non-commercial Academic, Educational and Personal use.
For commercial use, contact sales@humanetechnologies.co.uk` 

The [Open Source Hardware Definition](http://freedomdefined.org/OSHW) allows for commercial use of open source hardware, so I think it's possible it means something slightly different from how you're using the term? 

In any case, [anything posted on this site](/licenses) has to be open source OR clearly marked otherwise, so we'd appreciate if you could confirm or just adjust the wording here to make it clear what you mean. 

And for what it's worth, the benefits of fully open sourcing your work are incredible! Many projects shared in this way have grown enormously through contributed improvements. We totally understand if it's not for you, but we'd love it if you're planning to adopt a fully open license and join in the open source movement!

Thanks so much, and best of luck on your campaign!
