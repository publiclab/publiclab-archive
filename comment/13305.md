So, I'm making 15 of these conductivity probes to go along with the Digikey order that makes 15 Coquis. Last night cut open 15 plastic bottles with caps, washed the upper parts of the bottles and the caps, and left them to dry on paper towels overnight. Today i started testing whether water leaks through/around the screws in the caps, so i floated two of the bottletops and screw caps on two different cups of water. After 4 hours, the caps did not leak, which is great! 

Although now i realize this is not best practice, I took the opportunity while all the caps are dry to put silicone caulk around the base of the screws on the rest of them. This is no longer advised!
