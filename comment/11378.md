Hello!

This project, sadly, has been put in the back-burner for now. The individuals participating in it have been swamped with other LA River-related initiatives. We are hoping to release the map and videos relating to it soon. 

Lila and Kat are dedicating most of their time to Play the LA River (http://playthelariver.com/) a initiative that seeks to bring all Angelenos to the river. 

I currently dedicate all my energies to co-leading an effort called Futuro de Frogtown (http://www.mas.la/futuro) seeking to mitigate gentrification in Elysian Valley (neighborhood at the heart of all the River revitalization efforts and the 1 billion dollar investment announced last year). I have done some other mapping in the area, such as building perceptual maps of the built environment and balloon mapping a piece of land called the Bowtie Parcel. 

If you are interested in any of the projects I have mentioned, please hit me up at info@mlamadrid.com and I will gladly share more or connect you with Ken, Lila and Kat.

Best!
