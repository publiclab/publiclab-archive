You might want to point out that you are referring to the left sidebar which shows up on a subset of publiclab pages.

1. I don't think I have ever found the "Recent topic contributors" section in the sidebar to be useful.
2. Sometimes the "Recent wiki pages" section includes something I am looking for, but not often.
3. The "Related research notes" section is usually misleading because recent notes are favored. A note about exactly the same topic (same author and tags, similar title) from a year or two ago will not be included.
4. Maybe a section "Recent notes by this author" would be more useful to many.
4. When a map is included in the left sidebar, it never fails to make me mad. When I scroll through the note or wiki with the mouse wheel and scroll over the map, the scrolling stops and the maps starts to zoom. This is terrible user experience.
5. The left sidebar seems to be intended to help users find related content. I would think if that were a priority, the first step would be to fix the search function so it did what most people expect search to do (search titles, tags, and text [separately or in combination] to find the best match).
