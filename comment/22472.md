There is no clear way to conclusively prove PM came from a facility, but there are several inferences that can be drawn.

* Saturation Monitoring may identify a hotspot downwind of the facility: https://publiclab.org/wiki/site-survey

* A chemical assay may detect a product otherwise rare but expected in the facility's exhaust stream, but will have to be targetted to the pollutant.  This list of lab services is largely about silica, but there are a few organics labs that could be contacted about refinery emissions: https://publiclab.org/wiki/minivol#Laboratory+Services
