Yes, I think that makes sense and it's why i like the option of telling people "please enter an email in case you get locked out of your account"

However I think it's partially a matter of thinking of what the minimum steps are before someone can post a comment or question on the site. We can tell them relatively urgently that adding an email is important in case they unlink their Twitter, but it could be /after/ they go through the minimal barrier-to-entry login and get to what they initially want to do which could be to leave a comment or ask a question. It's kind of an ordering thing, and the easier it is to do your first "action" in public lab, the better. [@liz](/profile/liz), that's right, no?
