node: Why do raw RGB values differ from calibrated RGB values? I thought calibration just set pixels to wavelength (nm)?

I'll admit I'm not following your comparisons -- but a few thoughts anyway in case they will help. The second plot at least shows a CFL spectra; although 1) some 'tuning' of the hardware might gain more resolution and 2) the RGB channels are clipping. Clipping adds significant error to the RGB-combined 'avg' result which will likely swamp most other errors. I'd suggest the following sequence: 1) mechanically stable setup, 2) CFL capture w/o clipping, 3) wavelength-cal using the CFL plot. Then... take reference spectra using broad-band light (i.e. through water for example) and then, take spectra with test sample. The wavelength cal's output data (which is applied to other plots as the cal reference) only uses the pixel/nm relationship, not any amplitude data from the CFL cal plot. The difference between the 'water' reference spectra (CFL-Cal'd) and the 'test sample' spectra (also CFL-Cal'd with the same CFL nm/pix data) will be your amplitude difference result and will not contain any amplitude factors of the CFL plot.
