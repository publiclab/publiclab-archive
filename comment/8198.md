Well, reading up on the effect of shadows on NDVI, it certainly doesn't come as a surprise anymore. Here's a page demonstrating C3 technology:

Their page on 'shadows', soil and overexposure is enlightening to some extent.

Another reference on shadows:

Pre-processing images sounds like a good idea. It's also interesting to read how NDVI was started. Because absolute NIR / red reflectances don't provide a lot of info on plant health, the initial method was to relate NIR reflectance to the red visible light channel. This however made it possible to increase NDVI without bounds when visible light became very low, so the values were bounded in the formula of the NDVI formula we now know.

I've read some research where they used something called a "shadow index" to compensate for shadowy areas. They claim that they got reasonable results pre-processing photos this way.
