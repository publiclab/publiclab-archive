A commenter in [@Zengirl2](/profile/Zengirl2)  's adafruit blog post (which is great btw) had a good point. We don't know which is more effective the plant roots or the activated carbon. So overtime the carbon could reach its limit of HCHO sequestering and if the carbon was doing the lion's share of the work the filter would dramatically decrease in efficacy. The carbon in fish tank filters should be changed every 3-6 weeks. so we could follow up with another test in a couple months to see if the kit's efficacy drops off once the carbon reaches capacity. the problem is that off-gassing should also decrease over time but just not nearly as fast. Symptoms have not returned, and other studies demonstrate that bacterial metabolisms increase as HCHO increases, so both of those things bode well for the continued efficacy of this system.  

Thinking out loud: so how long do you think it would take before the carbon would reach filtering capacity? or should plan on refreshing the carbon at certain intervals?

or should we do tests with just carbon?
