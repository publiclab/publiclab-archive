Couple other notes - curvature correction would be great and pretty consistent for still captures, but would it scale to live-capture... and would you do it in JavaScript, so our offline users could make use of it? Just curious. 

Dave - linearity explored a bit: http://publiclab.org/notes/straylight/05-13-2013/using-the-spectroscope-for-analysis-of-concentration-beer-s-law

Personally i feel the ND-filtered variable slit is a strong solution (perhaps with a diffuser in front of the spec to even out all the light?) and I worry that auto-exposure compensation will make any attempt to do separate captures hard to control. But I could be totally wrong, it's just a gut feeling.
