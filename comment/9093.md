Yeah very nice -- for interfaces, think minimalist! Can we have the upload begin automatically, and not require a "start" button? Also, perhaps you could use the Bootstrap modal instead of the old one there: http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals

We'll get you a VM soon - if you want to try Heroku, go for it, though. 

Also, what do you think of just allowing people to drag images onto the map itself, to start uploading them?

I'm making a set of Github issues for you based on this feedback.
