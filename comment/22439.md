>What are the voltage requirements: are there upper and lower limits?

The silkscreen on the Riffle says 3.5v to 6v for the "general" power connection. That's different from typical 328p Arduinos (e.g., Uno, Nano) which can be powered by 7v to 12v. Maybe [@donblair](/profile/donblair) can confirm the range (oops, he won't see this because this is not a comment).

>How many AA/AAA equivalent batteries do you need to use, and can those be rechargeable?

So assuming 3.5v to 6v, the Riffle can use four AA or AAA batteries. Four alkalines would supply 6v, and four rechargeable NiMH (e.g., eneloop) would supply 4.8v (when the batteries are fresh). 

>Can commercial lithium rechargeable batteries like these be charged from the Riffle's JST circuitry?

Don't know. Those require a special size battery case -- they are not AA or AA. You might want a dedicated charger.

>How does JST work with conventional batteries? What are the easy methods and expert methods to attach JST connectors to batteries?

You can buy battery cases for AA and AAA batteries with JST connectors. For the Riffle you want JST ph 2-pin. It might not be easy to find a four battery case with a JST ph 2-pin connector. But cases are just a couple of bucks and JST connectors are cheap too.

4 AA case at Adafruit, $3.00: https://www.adafruit.com/products/830

I bought some JST ph 2-pin connectors but they don't quite fit in the ones on the Riffle. It was easy to shave the plastic so it fit. You can [buy a few here](http://kaptery.com/product/jst-ph-2pin-connectors).
