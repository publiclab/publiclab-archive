I'm curious about the browser-to-browser use case, because as a SoftModem compatible protocol, we could also make this available as a general purpose web-to-web serial library -- imagine sending an email from one webpage to another, or something, or sharing a link or a GPS point -- which has the added benefit of compatibility with an Arduino library. Why do you think it's only working phone-to-laptop, but not the reverse? I'm going to try phone-to-phone and laptop-to-laptop soon (once I can borrow some devices).
