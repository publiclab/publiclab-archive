Update:  I've attempted to incorporate both the fix to the switch, and the new diode-based power management strategy, in the Riffle 0.1.4 schematic.  The key part of the schematic is here:

[![powerManage1.png](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/778/medium/powerManage1.png)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/778/original/powerManage1.png)

Here's an explanation:

VBUS:  connected to 5V from USB

VGEN1:  connected a two-pin header on the board (JP1), feeds into the voltage regulator IC4 -- allowing any battery chemistry (under 6V) 

VGEN2:  connected to a JST connector (CN2), feeds into the voltage regulator IC4 -- allowing any battery chemistry (under 6V)

VBAT:  connected to a JST connector (CNL) for a 3.7V Lithium battery, which is charged by VBUS via U1 and also feeds into the voltage regulator IC4

J1: an on/off switch in front of the voltage regulator IC4

IC4:  a linear dropout regulator --> can take incoming voltage <=6 Volts, outputs 3.3 volts

VCC:  3.3V, powers the board (including the microcontroller)

U1:  the Lithium battery charger

The idea is that the diodes on the parallel VGEN1, VGEN2, VBUS, and VBAT lines -- which all lead into the LDO -- effectively select for the highest-voltage source, and also avoid problems if more than one power source is plugged in at once.  (Plugging into USB (VBUS) and having a lithium battery plugged into CNL will result in charging the battery; if no battery is connected to CNL but USB is connected, the board will still receive power.)

Whaddya think?
