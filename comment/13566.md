How many sensors can a Riffle monitor gracefully? 

Considering that the typical sensors that might be used are cheap and maybe unreliable, does it make sense to have three $2.00 temperature sensors as replicates? Conductivity sensors are even cheaper (a couple of screws), and notoriously unreliable, so why not have three of them on each Riffle deployment? 

If the Riffle and batteries are in a water bottle, can a single cable bundle pass to a separate enclosure that is a sensor pod? The pod could be a simple container of tough material (e.g., PVC) that is easy to drill and seal. The pod could bristle with replicate sensors. This gives each Riffle deployment a rigorous test of the precision of the sensors used, in addition to redundancy in case of failure.

But I guess that sensor pod could be just a little bigger and the Riffle could be in there. 

I have once again convinced myself to abandon the water bottle.

Sorry.
