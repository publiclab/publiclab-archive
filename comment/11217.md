Issue 7: Gain-Correction:
After some experimentation ( http://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/02-25-2015/plab-spectrometer-gain-correction ) it looks possible that a default gain-correction curve could be included as part of SWB at least as an option. While there are significant limits to the PLab devices from the intensity vs. wavelength calibration, as a true calibration, a first-order approximation seems like a major improvement in the direction of providing users with more meaningful spectral results.

[@warren](/profile/warren), I can add items to a tracking list though I've not noticed where such a list is located.
