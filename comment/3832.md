Blown out data should show up as 255 in the csv file and thus would appear in a graph as peaks with a flat top (plateau) when graphed in excel, and presumably this same plateau situation would show up in SpectralWorkbench as well. However, looking at one of my excel spreadsheets shows a max value of 257. How does SpectralWorkbench get that? 8bits per pixel is 2 to the 8th power (2^8) which is 256, so values should be 0-255. What am I missing?
