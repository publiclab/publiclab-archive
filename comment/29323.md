Dear Ag8N,

First.  Use the scientific method.  Try one thing with an idea. 
 Then try another if that fails.  Sum it up.  

What was "very impressive" for you about this experiment in spectroscopy?  And in using The SpectralWorkBench of Public Labs?  What experience have you had with spectroscopes and telescopes?  If you're an experimenter, how have you done so far?  i could refer you to a team better suited to work with you of a collaborative effort.
