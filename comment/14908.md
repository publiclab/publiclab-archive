Here is a timely and apropos idea for drilling holes in the pendulum or Picavet shafts. Last week I shipped a Picavet Hardware Kit (everything but the 3D printed Picavet cross) to a customer. Today he post a [drilling jig at Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1668377) for drilling the holes though the shaft. This would also work for the pendulum shaft. Maybe I should include one of these with each kit. Thanks bluepop4!.
