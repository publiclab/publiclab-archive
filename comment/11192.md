[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) We would probably add a gradient of colors (in the code) to indicate more varied temperatures than just hot/cold. Given how close we have to hold the LED/thermometer to a surface to detect temperature, we would have to add a lens over the LED to blend the RGB colors. We might also look into adding a display of the specific temperature or interface for the user to specify the threshold temperatures at which the LED reacts.
