Hi Liz--this is Daniela Soleri--thanks for the link!  Not sure if this is where I respond to your message.
I had looked at this photo once, hmmm, maybe. I need to check with my coauthors. The timeline is a bit tight--by 1st week of Dec, so while we are mulling perhaps you could ask the gardeners, or put me in touch to ask directly? I can send a synopsis, etc.
Let me know. All the best,
Daniela
