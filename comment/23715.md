 Hi! Thanks so much!!! Thanks especially for the work you've put into MapKnitter already, where we've been very grateful for your input, ideas, and implementations!

I'll cite my notes on [@kaustubh_nair](/profile/kaustubh_nair)'s [proposal](https://publiclab.org/notes/kaustubh_nair/03-26-2019/gsoc-proposal-mapknitter-rails-6-upgrade), which are relevant here too.

I also appreciate this sentiment, which I agree with:

One thing for both you and [@kaustubh_nair](/profile/kaustubh_nair) to consider is community review and input. Often, especially as the team gets bigger, it's tough to get fast feedback from project maintainers, especially on a big PR that takes a while to review. I wonder if folks working on Rails upgrades (and I know [@cesswairimu](/profile/cesswairimu) will also be looking at parts of this) might think about how to open new issues which ask the broader coding community to help test things out and collect input. [@souravirus](/profile/souravirus) and [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano) have done this a bit by opening an issue on `plots2` which ask people to try the new Bootstrap 4 upgrade, and to record issues related to it in the issue for solving. 

Thanks a lot!!!
