Unexpected yes -- it was for some reason much harder to get light into the webcam! But very easy on a smartphone. We're working a bit on this problem now, and the options seem to be: 

* increase UVC webcam exposure/gain (see here: http://publiclab.org/notes/jarrarte/08-06-2014/overexposure-using-yuv-format-and-manual-exposure-settings-with-infragram-webcam)
* increase slit width -- a non-ideal solution (because to double slit width, we half our wavelength precision) -- although maybe OK since we have an excess of wavelength resolution and it may already not be primarily limited by the width of the slit. i.e. we might get the same resolution with a wider slit because other factors are currently more limiting to precision
* print or adhere reflective material to inside of sample chamber, behind the sample, to get the laser to bounce back through, and also generally get light to reflect into the slit
* use a more sensitive webcam
* use a more sensitive smartphone camera (most are better than the webcams we're buying)
* put a larger lens on the webcam? Like the Infragram webcam's lens?
