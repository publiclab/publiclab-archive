Hi [@GreenFrogg](/profile/GreenFrogg)! Impressive work! </br>
We are now testing the potentiometers of the Shinyei PPD42 here in barcelona  using two sensors on the same plastic box to be sure of the variable resistance value needed for the sensor to mesure correctly. Do you think is possible for you to measure the potentiometer values of any of your stations using a multimeter? </br>
You can help us on this research note here ;) </br>
