Good points. I am checking if my University has a spectrometer, I do not think my department does, however our geology people may have one. Waiting on an answer to that. If they do and I can get access to it, I will grab a load of samples from the local hardware store and check them out. However I am in the UK, so the brands may vary, they do carry Valspar here, is that not also available in the U.S.? They also have some Rustoleum paints, so maybe I should check them if this is an option?
