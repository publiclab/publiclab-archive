[@warren](/profile/warren), the black ink looks quite dark in the photo and seems easy to apply. Hope it cures well.

I believe the primary factors are 1) the black color being "flat" as opposed to "reflective" and 2) the surface texture. So, the same black color value but of a "soft" surface will absorb light better than the same black color used to make a "hard" surface paper. The simplest very non-reflective balck surface is black felt. It has the advantage of having a very high surface area which, like with acoustics at a much larger scale, dramatically increases the scattering -- and the light (like sound) looses a little energy (turns to heat) on each "micro-reflection". Also quite good is soft black fabric. However, for simplicity, simple black paper, construction paper and (some) cardstock are often much easier to cut and install.

As for the baffle, the idea came from having some bright reflections from light leakage from the source (lamp) being observed -- as opposed to exclusively light from the slit itself. So, the baffle is of more or less importance dependent on the source of "leakage" light. Since the baffle is just a "helper" it's design is less critical. As for re-purposing the old grating holder, a factor to watch for is to avoid surface angles which might tend to cause any reflected light on the camera side to be directed back at the DVD surface. It also appears very simple to just add another "slit mount" as a baffle support since the pieces are all the same and the baffle is just another piece of black paper; all very easy and cheap.

As for the slit mount position, a half-inch variance isn't going to matter. I mounted it back from the end just to avoid having that part interfere with the paper housing when the assembly is inserted. Ideally, the entire device should be longer to improve the optical performance.
