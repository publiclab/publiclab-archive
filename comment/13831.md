BTW .... the comments about LED 'voltage' perspective do not seem inline with LED parameters. With LEDs, it's not the voltage, it's the current you want to control -- the LED voltage drop is only a result of the current which is set. If you use a direct connect between variable power supply and the LED, you are assuming the supply's current limit is part of the equation -- potentially an 'unlimited' supply of current should the voltage exceed operating parameters which can easily produce thermal runaway. At low voltages, you can 'get-away-with' a voltage source but really, LEDs should always be powered off a  higher voltage supply with a series resistor and then measure / set the current to be within the LEDs operating range.
