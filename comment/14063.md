Hi Jeffrey,
the Bell modem standard is basically FSK with the frequencies 1200 and 2200 Hz. SoftModem uses different frequencies for FSK, but that is just a matter of configuration.

I concur that modularity will be beneficial for the JavaScrip implementation. At the moment I can't see where higher modularity for the Arduino library can be achieved or is necessary.
