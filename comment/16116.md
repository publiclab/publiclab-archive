[@warren](/profile/warren), Here is the link to my latest cam https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/99143# also in Sun sky tags the slit is ca 0.04 mm cam is the MS life cam 1080P. There are many more images with the tags and also cams. BTW, coding is not one of my skill set. Seems with the web cam technology advances (sensor) we should strive to fine tune SW. Thanks for the invite.
