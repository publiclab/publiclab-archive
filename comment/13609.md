The CSV data files have poorly formatted data. The text of the files often looks like this: 206.809,2.55,2.5500000000000003,7.6499999999999995,2.5500000000000003 . Also, since the wavelength precision of the measurements is only 1nm and the accuracy is less, the wavelengths after CFL cal should all be nice integer values with uniform 1nm increments. I'd thought this had been done already -- if not, it should be updated.
