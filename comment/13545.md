Parth,

The dual band dichroic filters are very expensive and seem to work best if installed inside the camera. They should provide better results than inexpensive dye-based filters, but only if all the other variables are controlled. If you are not going to calibrate the process with targets in the photos, the benefits might not be realized. I don't know if the Arduino cameras allow manual control of white balance. If not then calibration might be required to get meaningful results.
