Thank you so much for writing back Katie! Short answer is that Topics are curated "Research areas" that area relevant to environmental justice inquiry whereas tags are simply all tags that have ever been used. 

"water, soil, air, and organizing" are each big, and together they are enormous...essentially the entire website. There are many research areas within each of water, air, and soil, so taking on these broadest categories would exceed our capacity to review in the next 5 months, ad we would fail ðŸ˜… .

I'm wondering if you were to try to narrow down to what part of "water" would be most helpful, what you might come up with? Same for "air" and "soil"?

Thanks again for engaging with this meta question!
