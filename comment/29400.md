Thank you very much [@warren](/profile/warren) for the detailed feedback. I have learned a lot from it. I now understand the noise issue better. I will do more research on fixing that issue. 
Also I have an IOS device, so that is not going to be an issue. I will work on reproducing the issue we are facing.
Thank you. I appreciate your comments
