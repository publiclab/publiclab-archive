Checked on amazon.  Found three spectrometers, similar in function to the spectrum lab.  They are priced at $7, $9, and $37. The $37 is the best. If interested, please look over the data on it, if nothing else.  The calibration lines (for example, the sun) are listed on the front.  The accuracy is an issue, judging on the one previous comment.  The data sheets from the manufacturer are interesting reading, if nothing else.
