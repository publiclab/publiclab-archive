Thanks Chris. This is long but worth it. Lots of tips on kites, rigs and RC control and beautiful images. Also the importance of having an intention of what you want before you fly. More relevant perhaps for aerial aesthetic imagery, than mapping. However, also important if trying to convey an impact of a change through mapping.
