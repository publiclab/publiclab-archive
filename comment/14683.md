Great note and comment thread! 
Thank you [@Ananyo2012](/profile/Ananyo2012) for putting this together and also for very detailed email communications. It's really great working with you. 

I share Stevie's interest in having whatever we create as Q&A being really easy to search for answers and contribute new answers. Basically the "following, sorting, finding" points mentioned above.  

In terms of how Q&A could be displayed, let's start by imagining a future where the abundance of questions and answers that are currently buried in (and repeatedly unearthed/reprised on) our mailing lists are now living on our website. With my limited imagination it seems like "spectroscopy-basics" or a similar tag that groups all "getting-started" questions together into a useful FAQ for first-timers is the critical move here. Would this FAQ emerge and reshuffle over time based on popularity or is it curated? How can Q&A be most welcoming/useful to new folks looking to get started?

While it's amazingly helpful to have StackOverflow as a model, we don't have to follow it exactly. "Upvote" is pretty generic, how about getting directly to the point with a button that says something like "This is helpful to me" or "I have tried this, and it worked". To me, that is a more meaningful "click" that someone could contribute, and related to our culture of empiricism.

I'm still musing on answer "approval." It seems straightforward to have the original person who asked the question be able to indicate if the answer was helpful, and i would want to know if the question-asker feels that they were helped or if they are still stuck. However, i wouldn't want to depend on one person to indicate the best answer, and perhaps the best answer changes over time -- maybe the top answer could emerge from how many people clicked "I have tried this, and it worked". I'm not sure, what do you all think?

We are avoiding badging, reputation, reward, and gamification systems as long-term studies are revealing that they reinforce participation inequality. Public Lab does have a [barnstar system](/wiki/barnstars) for expressing community appreciation.

Wow this got to be probably my longest comment ever. 
[@ananyo2012](/profile/ananyo2012) , i want to thank you again for contributing to such an important feature for the public lab community! I'm still working through the email thread ideas about the Answer model, and the whole structure of commenting on Answers to Questions which is an exact copy of StackOverflow that i'm not sure we need but am open to exploring.
