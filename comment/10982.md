`...if the grooved side of the DVD diffraction grating is either facing towards or away from the camera...`  
I experimented with that once, although I was trying to learn if it made any difference to the [best angle for the grating](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/2-12-2013/grating-angle-dvdr), not the sharpness of the diffraction pattern. But I did not notice any difference in sharpness of the diffraction pattern. It also made little or no difference to the grating angle, although if flipping the grating over also changes the orientation of the curves in the DVD grooves, the height of the diffraction pattern (perpendicular to the wavelength scale) changes. I'm not sure why that is.

If you line the inside of the spectrometer with fabric, beware that some dark fabrics reflect quite a lot of NIR. I think I got lucky when I blindly used cheap polyester felt. The photo below is of two purchases of felt taken with a pure NIR camera. I think this is a good result, even though the felt does reflect some of the camera's flash.
