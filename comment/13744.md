[@kkoerner](/profile/kkoerner), I tried a similar pump when I was researching this and it created too much turbulent/pulsed of the air stream to get a good measurement when restricted to low flow levels.  I ended up using a 3 diaphragm low voltage 12VDC pump, I did a writeup with low voltage DC pumps that work: http://lukeskaff.com/diy-formaldehyde-testing
