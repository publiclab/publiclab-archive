Great conversation.  I don’t really have any experience but have tried to research the topic and follow thru on  amirberAgain comments. 


My comments: 

-Python seems to offer several options  that support Computer Vision processing.  These include pillow /PIL  (Public Image Library)( http://python-pillow.org/), Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/), Numby (http://www.numpy.org/), SciPi (https://www.scipy.org/), OpenCV( https://opencv.org/) and  picamera (http://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.12/index.html#).   Since these different programs can work together and have overlapping features, there seems to be multiple ways to analyze/process images.  I assume the same is true for javascript but have not found  the equivalent code that ranges from camera control to scientific processing.    For example, I have not been able to find  js code  that controls camera functions such as picamera.   

-What may be more  important than js vs python is the ability to maintain image control/integrity.   By image integrity I mean the ability to understand all the preprocessing steps (everything from white balance to image compression) that occur when an image is recorded.  I have learned from  adobe photoshop processing  that post production flexibility works best when there is an unprocessed image.    I suspect the same is true when analyzing images  for scientific data.

-One of the goals of my GSOC project is to understand the benefits of using unprocessed images.   Since “OpenCV uses numpy arrays as images and defaults to colors in planar BGR”  (http://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.12/recipes2.html),  collecting BGR seems like the best initial image  collection approach.  It’s also likely different formats may work best for different applications.   For example, high resolution compressed jpg for microscope images, BGR for infragram (https://publiclab.org/wiki/raspberry-pi-infragram) and bayer images for measuring the color smears produced by spectrometers (https://publiclab.org/w/lego-spectrometer).
