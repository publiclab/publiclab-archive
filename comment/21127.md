Hello [@faithngetich188](/profile/faithngetich188) -- wow, you've made SO MANY contributions already! Thank you for your energy and enthusiasm! 

I love the mockups you've drawn - the one with 6 graphs actually really made me feel suddenly like our stats system is a big and exciting new zone of the site, and it was really brought to life through this mockup :-)

In some places of your timeline, I think it would be great to see a few links to different areas of the existing codebase - to give a better sense of where these features and new code segments would be implemented, and how they relate to existing code. What would go into a model, a controller, a view?  Are you familiar with the MVC model and how to break up code among these parts? 

Thanks a lot! Hope this helps!
