wow, what a useful research note, thanks for taking the time to post it and explain what you did.

Interesting to be able to compare the ocean optics scope.

great spectra too, awesome work.

The main problem I'm having with my rig is getting enough light in to capture the lines on a cheap webcam. Flame spectroscopy doesn't produce a lot of light and I think the autoexposure on the webcam is fighting me. Moving to a decent camera looks to be the way to go.

thanks again
