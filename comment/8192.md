Hi, Thanks.  Answers as follows:
1.  Yes - kit does come with a color card.  Its got 3 states.  Control (orange), Pink (bad), Pink/Orange (so-so)
2.  No - no instrumentation is needed to run the assay (I came up with that on my own).
3.  Yes - I thought that if I could measure the cholinesterase or the substrate rather than watch a color change, then I could improve the precision of the assay.  
4.  Not sure - I tried RGB, and saw some modulation but I was focused on 415nm for the first cycle of learning.
5.  415nm was something I came across in the research I did prior to running experiments.
6.  No - questions are good.  I want people to challenge this, that is why I put it out in a public forum. 
7.  I'm very interested in the washing part.  What I think I know at this time is that washing in water may not work that well, as most of these pesticides seem to have limited water solubility.  If they were water soluble, then why would I need to use an organic solvent to extract them?  What I think needs more understanding is what is the half-life of a pesticide residue, and can that be modulated?
