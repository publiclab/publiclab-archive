If that model is modified to allow for the components and the ribbon, it should be done so the new underside surfaces are not horizontal. FDM printing can choke on large horizontal underside surfaces unless they are the very bottom of the piece. The existing flat horizontal surface in your image (southeast of the rectangle annotations) will not be printed gracefully and should be sloped or domed.

The last known locations of the other Makerbots are listed here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/makerbot-machine-logs. If any of these are no longer in use, I would be happy to pay for shipping a few to me or print some parts in exchange for shipping.
