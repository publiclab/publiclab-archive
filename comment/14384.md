[@Warren](/profile/Warren), yes, I do acknowledge your points and [@viechdokter](/profile/viechdokter) 's. I would differentiate by noting that I'm not suggesting to disable or remove the existing 'new research notes' posting area. What I am promoting are separate, but directly accessible pages, which contain material that qualifies as material that is more focused, more scientific (or engineering, or construction, ...) which have been "accepted" as meeting some basic criteria.

I agree, that there is the concern about wishing to be welcoming to anyone expressing an interest and about not being 'too exclusive'. However, science (ideally) is not about feelings; it is about curiosity, learning, observation, data, and verifiable fact which should not be diluted by illusion. Science is also all about learning -- which is at a unique stage for everyone. However, that is orthogonal, to this topic, for PLab. PLab's outreach is already organized to be wecoming -- now it's just time to organize what arrived as a result of that effort and that organization should be on the basis of science. Make sense?
