[@code4maine](/profile/code4maine)-- certainly, doing bluetooth coupling  with a home-built Gps unit and the rest sounds like a bit of a pain in the field.  I'd just take two photos-- one of the thing you want, and a second of the GPS unit, and then manually place the images upon return.  Its not ideal, but its dead simple.
