dhafnersr,

I was particularly interested in your Molar Absorption Coefficients vs Wavelength.

The values seem to be a liitle peculiar to me, but I am not familiar with the calculations that you must have used to get the values.

If you can let me know the calculations that you used, I will then be able to compare my results with yours.
