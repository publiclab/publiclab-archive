Yah I'll happily uploaded them and post the links on here when I get them all together, This is the first time i've ever shared one of my builds so kinda new at it . I didn't change any of the widths so its just like it came from public lab. Now my light modules were built out of a cheap laser pointers that I bought at dollar general I simply took them apart and used the frame to build all the different types. To make like easy I also designed the cuvette holder with a drop in frame to hold the light module . This way you can remove the frame and insert the module and then place it in the cuvette holder.
