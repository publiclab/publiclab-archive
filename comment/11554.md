Hi abaker, I forgot about that wavelength file. The wavelengths in the file will be incorrect and a calibration will need to be done to get the correct ones. However, so the GUI will work, the wavelength file should be in the same location as your Sketchbook. In Processing go to File->Preferences, here there will be a path to your "Sketchbook," just copy and past the wavelength file to this location and it should work. As far as the Java error, I get those at random times, it's an issue with Processing. I just stop and re-start the GUI until it loads without the error.
