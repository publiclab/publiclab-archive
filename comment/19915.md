Ok, visualizing the spectra helps.
1 - The calibration (wavelength calibration using a CFL source) does not require an amplitude change (though SWB is likely doing this).
2 - Using a Calibration result doesn't alter a measurement spectra's amplitude -- it only corrects the relationship between camera pixels and wavelength (nm).
3 - Once calibrated (wavelength), additional measurements can (should) use that Cal reference.
4 - Remember, the wavelength calibration is only valid if the mechanics of the spectrometer doesn't change (this is a mechanical issue where it is best to leave the spectrometer physical device mounted so it doesn't change for all measurements which are based on that calibration.
