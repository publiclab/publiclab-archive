Hi Jasja,

I think the stereo photography and other synchronous photography done with SDM requires that an external signal be sent to the multiple cameras.  That is often done with a switch or timer (or fancy timer for bullet-time sequences).  Our goal is to have the cameras receive this signal while they are aloft, so a circuit of some sort is required.  SDM or CHDK can trigger a camera at any interval, but it can't synchronize two cameras without an external signal.  We have figured out how to use CHDK (which has the same features as SDM) to precisely sync two cameras (http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/4-14-2012/good-shutter-synchronization). We are now working on doing this with a $5 timer (http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/5-2-2012/no-output-signal-ir-kit-timer).  That is mostly resolved except for finding an appropriate battery. Up soon will be syncing the cameras with a $10 transmitter/receiver pair (http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/4-22-2012/tiny-remote-control).  So it's kind of like all circuits, all the time!
