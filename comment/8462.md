Adding this to the comments of the post too, but i also recommend: 

* cotton swabs
* bring rubber gloves and plenty of mineral oil! and extra AAA batteries! 

Also worth it:

* following the procedure described here: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/12-11-2013/spectrometry-sample-extraction-at-the-parts-crafts-toolshed-raising
* checkin' out the drawings here, which I hope to cut up and turn into a more structured guide soon: http://publiclab.org/wiki/oil-testing-kit
* seeing how incredibly bright you can get fluorescence here: http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/02-25-2014/mobile-cuvette-holder

One big question it'd be great to answer is how concentrated you have to get the mineral oil with your sample before it fluoresces brightly enough. And how do you measure it? I've been saying add more sample until it's "like weak tea". but maybe comparing it to a % grey reference or something...

Take good pictures of each step so you can share what went well or poorly!

Some pure oil references you just pour in from a bottle (instead of dissolving from street residue around the edge of a drain or from a tar ball) may need to be diluted quite a bit with mineral oil because the laser doesn't go all the way through it. I found this was true for motor oil and olive oil.
