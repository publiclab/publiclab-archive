Thanks for the feedback everyone! I'd been traveling a lot lately and then catching up, so most of the equipment has been just sitting around.

I've done some basic testing of the camera, and to put it bluntly…it's crap. The reason it was so cheap — free now, actually, once I filed a complaint with eBay! — is that it is a much lower-end model than advertised in the listing.

I did pick up a cheap-but-decent reel and rod too, after staring at the fishing line and deciding I didn't want to ever wind it by hand even once :-P

Where I'm at with this:

- kit cost probably twice as much as hoped (change to $40 for an actually maybe half-decent keychain camera, add $20 for basic reel and rod)
- have keychain weight: 15.6g total (7.5g for the PCB+battery, 5.1g for the plastic case, 3.0g for the metal "keychain-y" part)
- haven't actually tried the 2ft ballon rig (well I did test if an even smaller balloon could lift it — nope!)

Going camping for a few days this weekend though and planning to bring the kit, so hopefully more interesting results soon!
