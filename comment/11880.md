Looks like a nice setup!  For bubbles, the cheap ready made option would be any liquid bubble--the kid's toy to blow bubbles.  [@danbeavers](/profile/danbeavers) I think a pipette is a great idea for this low flow measurement.  This is a very old, proven method for measuring flow but like all primitive methods it takes some tinkering to perfect.  I also prefer to use an actual stop watch--not a phone app, which can be slower.

RE: breaking the tip at the tube consistently shouldn't effect the flow if you have a strong enough pump.  If you have a pump that normally runs at 5 lpm without a valve and then you add a valve to restrict it to 0.3 lpm I think you'll find the flow is fairly consistent even with moderate loading.  The high differential pressure across the valve creates a critical flow situation.  Not all pumps designs can be restricted though--some will over heat.  What is important though, is to warm up the pump before you start testing or measuring the flow.  Often the pumps need a few minutes to settle into a constant temperature.  Some pumps never reach a constant flow and will ever so slightly cycle in flow like a sine wave.

A sampling protocol might look something like:

1. Turn on pump and let run for at least 5 min
2. Attach dummy tube (a used tube) and set flow rate
3. Attach sampling tube and record start time
4. Measure sample flow and record start flow rate (don't bother adjusting--should be close enough to previously measured)
5. (optional) before the end of the sample, measure sample flow and record end flow rate.
6. Remove tube and record end time
7. Turn off pump

then sample volume = (start flow rate + end flow rate) / 2 x (end time - start time)

for flow field measurements I would use a glass rotameter that was calibrated in the lab with the graduated cylinder technique.  the glass rotameters aren't cheap but they're less expensive than the automated methods and they're quite durable (and never require charging!).  There are many makers of these and the better ones are sold by Matheson (order without the valve):

They do make tube tip breakers though.  I used to use the Drager version and while the $50 cost is shocking, if you're doing a lot of testing it makes it much easier and safer.  It's basically a shallow hole with a ceramic edge that you stick the glass end in and twist the tube to score the glass.  Then you stick the end of the tube in a deeper, crooked hole and snap off the end.
