Thanks for all your responses! They are all exciting! Especially,

> even publishing as a draft and soliciting input/review as discussed in the comments of this post

I love the idea of posting a work in progress! This way others can comment on what you're about to do, and hold you to doing it! It could potentially come with the ability to set a deadline for yourself -- that's either public or visible only to you.

There's a research note that I want to write, but haven't yet because I haven't done the work. Something like this would help me get started by planning my project in a research note, give me feedback on what I'm planning on doing, and help me get started by breaking up the effort into smaller pieces.
