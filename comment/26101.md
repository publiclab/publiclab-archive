Thanks a lot, Jack! Considering the prices, I'm wondering whether adding a MID-IR filter to some cheaper detector, and strongly amplifying the residual signal could do the job ( ... but of course signal/noise ratio will be the limiting factor). And such filters are not cheap by themselves!
Anyways thanks for your help.
