Thanks for the question. My apologies that all of the graphs appear to have vanished (they have for me). Not sure why, maybe a hosting issue.

Anyway,  I am not sure about the -log(I/io) relationship. I simply used the difference between the baseline and the sample as a measure of absorbance (A=I-Io) at particular wavelengths as you deduced, and then simply converted this to a percentage absorbance.  Then plotting absorbance vs concentration, obtained the linear (Beer's Law) graphs. My understanding of Beer's Law is that absorbance is directly proportional to concentration.

I am not a chemistry major, so I am not sure about the -log(I/Io) relationship. I would be interested in learning more about this ! Sorry I can't help any further.
