Hi, Vidhun - can you add your profile links and github fork link here: http://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc-2014 

Thanks!

I'd love the codebase to be at least Rails 3, and it wouldn't be too much work, but I think it may be a distraction from this summer's work for you. But tell us if you keep having trouble with 2.3.x

Please take a look at the code I linked to from your proposal page, in the https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/ codebase, which is a working jquery-file-upload system integrated into a Rails 3.2 site. I'd start perhaps by creating an empty page with an upload area, with a dotted region just like http://publiclab.org/post and just seeing if you can upload a single image. That'll really be the first big task of your project and you'll then be able to include that template (view) in other page layouts. 

Thanks for the update and for posting it as a research note!
