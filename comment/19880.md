This is interesting, did you try to re-focus for the NIR LEDs? It's very likely that the lens wasn't designed for these wavelengths and re-focusing would let you capture images as sharp with those LEDs as well. 
Also, IDK about those insects specifically, but using a <400 nm LED could show some fluorescence.
