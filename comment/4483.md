thanks Brian,

if you cut a big hole in the side of the bottle and pass the bunsen in through that. Then feed the gas hose in through a smaller hole in the neck of the bottle. I use insulation tape to hold the bunsen in place around the top of the bunsen and top of the bottle. The salt solution is then sprayed through the big hole, underneath the bunsen.

no photoshopping ! :)

the other correction I have to add is to *not* clean the DVD plastic grating. The lines are imprinted on the purple dye, cleaning it off all but destroys the spectrum.
