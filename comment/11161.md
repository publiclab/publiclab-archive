[@stoft](/profile/stoft) - that would be **so great** and I've tried it with a cable like this one; unfortunately it's up to Google and the handset and browser manufacturers to actually make such peripherals show up as USB webcams to the browser; I haven't seen any browser that can do it yet. Maybe we can file an issue on Firefox's bug tracker?
