Wow!  That sounds great!  I'll try to add some more information to the wiki to give people a better idea of the general project parameters and what are current limitations are.  Currently the biggest challenge we're having is the limited network coverage in the field sites.  Even if the iPads the kids are using had 3G, it wouldn't do any good as there's no service anyway.  When I first wrote the wiki we were looking into Rhuus for its cross platform/offline compatibility.  We eventually realized that there are other options available now, like Mapbox, that weren't possible yet when Rhuus was first created.  Do you think this is accurate?

  The annotation feature on Mapknitter would be a great way to view the geotagged field data on its own layer.  Especially if we're able to capture aerial imagery simultaneously with the field collections.  Although, there will likely be days, as there was today, when samples are collected without companion aerial imagery.  We would have to make sure to clearly identify orphaned data that may be overlayed on an earlier basemap.

Is it against the TOS to use a .kml from GE as a reference?  If not then maybe I can try it out sooner rather than later?
