Hi [@SBucic](/profile/SBucic) ! Another community group in the past monitored formaldehyde at natural gas compressor stations using an electronic meter. There's some info on that in [this research note](https://publiclab.org/notes/nshapiro/05-08-2015/community-formaldehyde-monitoring-at-natural-gas-compressor-stations-protocol-and-data-sheet) by [@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) and [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke). There are also some chemistry-based methods for formaldehyde outlined [here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/formaldehyde-test-kit#Existing+Methods).

For monitoring other gases, one option is the [air bucket monitor](https://publiclab.org/wiki/bucket-monitor), which takes individual air samples ("grab samples") in a special bag that's then shipped to a lab for analysis. The need for lab analysis can be challenging (cost and time-wise), but multiple gases can be detected with one air sample. In case it helps, here's one resource I found that lists the [kinds of gases that could be emitted from a compressor station](https://www.nocompressor.com/air-quality).

[@jjcreedon](/profile/jjcreedon) might have some advice to share?
