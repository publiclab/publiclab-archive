The default app `raspicam` can be used to take a picture from the commandline, and then you could use Image Sequencer to do the NDVI -- 

https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer#cli-usage

something like:

```
    $ image-sequencer -i image.jpg -s ndvi-red
```

So all together:

```
    $ raspistill -o image.jpg  && image-sequencer -i image.jpg -s ndvi-red
```

Or to take images regularly, you can use a `$DATE` variable to name the file: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/raspistill.md

[@tech4gt](/profile/tech4gt) - what do you think of this use for Image Sequencer?
