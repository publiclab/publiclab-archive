Quick additional questions -- for ethnicity, was there an important reason the Community Survey doesn't allow "check all"? (I usually check more than one)

And does the Community Survey say anything about how data will be used, whether it's private or anonymous or where the results could be shared? I'm trying to craft a sentence about that for this.

Thanks!!!
