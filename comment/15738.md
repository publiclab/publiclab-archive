You are correct that Things are very different from STate to State, that is the deal with US "Federalist" philosophy of government.

There are national associations that try to describe how things are different.  Water law and USACE policy, for example is a mess.  

ASWM is drafting a guide to state by state wetland regulations, for example.  remind me to post that by end of year?
