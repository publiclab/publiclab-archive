Some of the research and insights I studied with people and visited some cemeteries and burial grounds to observe and check the Area covered.

I created Google My Maps, https://bit.ly/2XgSHX2 , https://bit.ly/30YF6pV  to check the Total Area covered at 3 different places. It occupies nearly  1 Lakh sq.ft(includes office, dead bodies, gasifier etc).
