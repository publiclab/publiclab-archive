Wow what great resources on soil testing! I run a local concrete company and honestly you'd be surprised how many times we need to do some form of soil testing for concrete work. Especially when we're involved in building a new home with a foundation. Typically, we've contracted an outside company to handle this, but I was curious what it would take to bring the soil testing in house. Very interested in looking more into this. Also check out our [concrete contractor](https://concretecontractorsmilwaukeewi.com) service if you want to learn more on that!
