 Building on this in the thought of a classroom setting, students could wear simple air sensors, manually log their data, then compile it on a map to identify spots in their school where they'd like to install other, more permanent sensors. manually logging the data when the simple air sensor goes off can also add info you wouldn't get from a purple air, like what it smells like, what's going on at the time, what is the weather like, etc. It could help determine what qualities of the air you'd like to investigate more thoroughly.
