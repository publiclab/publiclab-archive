[@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) - I think this is a provisional "yes" -- thanks [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)! Which is to say, a good follow-up question for the company is "how much resolution does your logger offer" so we have a sense of how an Arduino's ~35 possible values from highest to lowest compares to what they offer.  

[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) [@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2) - does that sound right?
