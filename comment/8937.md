Dave - Thanks a lot for the insights...As you said, when I add oil sample, intensity decreases and since the plots above is the difference between the baseline and the spectra of oil sample (baseline - spectra of sample), pure olive oil has the largest difference (i.e. high absorbance). I do not have chemistry background, so, I am not sure which molecules are causing this behavior. 

I did not try the experiment with water. Also, I guess, it is not easy to say what type of oil is used to dilute the olive oil without having set of spectra for candidate oils. One way to solve this problem seems to be repeating the same experiment with other oils (sesame, hazelnut, canola etc.). Another option is to collect pure spectra from different oils and come up with a pattern recognition algorithm (clustering/classification with some soft decision rules) to figure out the unknown mixture.

Jeffh - Thanks a lot for the info. I am using the original bulb and I am sure using little more expensive (better) light source will help a lot.
