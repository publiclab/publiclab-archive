 [@Tomp](/profile/Tomp),  I'm not sure I understand your question but "particle counters" are basically counting particles and converting the counts to densities. The ones I know about allow you to get the output as either densities, such as µg per cubic meter, or counts, such as particles per dl. Hope this helps.
