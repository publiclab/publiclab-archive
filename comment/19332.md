I'd like to try to get input from some of the many people at http://publiclab.org/contributors/datalogger who have almost certainly interfaced their Arduinos with a sensor with these requirements. 

I think we could loop many of those people in here, OR we could post a follow-up more specifically asking "how do I connect and program this ADC" -- i'll send you the list of usernames we can `@mention` in a sec.
