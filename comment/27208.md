For the bucket monitor I think we want to be looking for air labs specifically. We may want to use the a2la certification to try to narrow it down.  Here is some recent information I got talking to the folks at Atmospheric Analysis in CA:

- In the United States, not every lab that does environmental testing will automatically test air samples and there seems to be significant variation in terms of the type of sampling that air labs will do.  For instance, air labs seem to make individual calls as to which methods they support.  Not all labs are planning to roll out the new TO-15a protocols; some will do both TO-14a and TO-15- test specific chemicals within that method (so it's important to ask)
- Within a given method, labs may only test a subset of chemicals (so it's important to ask)
- in the United States there is no national air accreditation; labs are accredited state by state, environmental labs that want to do air work have to go through states (Oregon and Florida both do it) for air certification.  
- it's not a given that a lab will do air, soil, and water -- and in some cases, the testing thresholds for labs that do all three or two of three may need to be higher because of potential cross-contamination
