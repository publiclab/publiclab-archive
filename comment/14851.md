Hi, I haven't heard of someone doing this sort of analysis in our community, and since at least ethanol and methanol are optically clear (not familiar with KHCO3), this could be difficult. I'd start by doing some searches for the range of wavelengths typically used to detect/distinguish these. I don't believe ethanol or methanol fluoresce, so I guess you're thinking of absorption spectroscopy? It may be that they don't have measurable spectral features in the range (~400-900nm) of our spec design.
