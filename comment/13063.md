The link above to the Python code for converting photos to NDVI images is not a link at Public Lab. However, a version of this Python code is available at the Public Lab Github repository: https://github.com/publiclab/infrapix/blob/master/README.md. It appears that the code is intended for blue filtered cameras only and has one color mapping scheme. Rutvij found this code and used it to make the NDVI image below.

The two GitHub repositories with code to convert Infragram photos to NDVI are nice resources for those who know what to do with them. They are not intended as resources for beginners and don't have comprehensive user manuals. If people find them and want to use them they should be able to contact the authors to ask questions, but Public Lab probably does not have any obligation to make this resource any more user-friendly. The fact that this python code produces different results from infragram.org or the Fiji plugin is confusing but not surprising.

The path of least resistance for new users of infragram cameras is probably infragram.org. I don't know what the user experience is like there for beginners. People seem to be doing lots of interesting things there but it's hard to tell whether they get what they are trying to get.

If I were selling Infragram cameras so that customers could learn something from NDVI images, I would hesitate to send them to infragram.org to process their photos without supplying an explanation of the limitations and alternatives.

I guess it's not possible to know how many people use the Photo Monitoring Fiji plugin or what success people have with it.
