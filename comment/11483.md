These instructions are really great, except I feel like there's a gap between the laser attenuator and the completed assembly.

"Place in front of the spectrometer", which I assume refers to placing the laser attenuator in front of the spectrometer, is a fairly ambiguous instruction. The completed image doesn't show a laser attenuator (at least not obviously). Could you clear up where the laser attenuator goes?
