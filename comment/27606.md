Hi Liz,

Thank you for your comment.

Yes, you are correct. I meant PurpleAir rather than Pure Air, well spotted.

I tried 3 times to politely chat to my neighbor about the issue (over a period of 6 months) and on the third occasion he blatantly told me "It's my home, I can smoke when and where I want".

I have also tried to think of other methods to communicate the extend of this problem using the PurpleAir sensor (if it can show a detectable change in air quality during when they smoke).

One idea was to send them an email once a week/month highlighting the spikes in air quality that is caused by their smoking. However, I don't believe it will make a difference as they don't care that the smoke is causing me an issue and simply believe I should shut down doors/windows if I don't like it.

Will keep trying to think of a way to resolve this issue.

Regards
