What a perfect fit! I'm really impressed by your design and appropriation of materials.

I was just thinking-- Jesse Breen used a CD -sized "milk crate" for her picavet--

I bet the techniques used in the FABArig would work with a milk crate as well.  Because the milk crate already has holes in the bottom, it would be a rig that could be assembled without drilling or cutting the container, lowering the required skill level of the rig.  The crates can also stack next to each other for easy alignment of multiple cameras.

unfortunately, the crates with holes in the bottom are almost $10 each shipped:

the cheap crates don't seem have holes in the bottom:
