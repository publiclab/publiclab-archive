Hi [@scotttees](/profile/scotttees) ! There are a couple people I've been talking to recently who have been working with the Purple Air: [@dswenson](/profile/dswenson) [@jiteovien](/profile/jiteovien) [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) [@ramseysprague](/profile/ramseysprague) They might be able to help with insight on that tool. 

Also sulfur is a pretty noxious pollutant. Might be interesting to loop in with people who are working on odor reporting: [@imvec](/profile/imvec) and [@sarasage](/profile/sarasage) 

And just for the topic in general [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) and [@a1ahna](/profile/a1ahna) might have some ideas!
