LIDAR is possible by drone, but it's a much more expensive technique and if you don't have a trained pilot and an excellent quality UAV you are putting a lot of money at risk.  In most situations you are better off using expensive LIDAR equipment from a helicopter or fixed wing aircraft.  

At this point I'd say photogrammetry is much better fitted to low budget operations with relatively high risk platforms (kite, drone, balloon).  It also has the benefit of giving you color and texture data in 3D.  LIDAR is used on drones by some professional groups though and provides unambiguous data that involves a little less processing and fewer stray 3D points.
