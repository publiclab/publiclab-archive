Hi, [@coight](/profile/coight)! This looks like a spectacular (for real!) project and I'd love to learn more. 

There are two ways of smoothing that I know of. One is "time-averaging" which can reduce noise and preserve finer features, and that's available via the "More tools" menu in the current version, as in the screenshot below:

There's also "rolling average" smoothing, which instead of averaging repeated spectra over time, just averages neighboring pixels along a single line of data. This is fast, and useful for some things, but does destroy data and smooths indiscriminately over both noise and finer non-noise features. This is [going to be featured](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/issues/176) in the new v2.0 which we're hoping to launch a preview of this week.
