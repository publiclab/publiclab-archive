[@stoft](/profile/stoft) - great start. I guess implicit is that anyone could go down a checklist like this as part of reviewing. Obviously lots to discuss, and may want to hold off going into too much detail until the OpenHour (so there can be broader discussion of these ideas by the community), but just to think ahead, how might we prompt people to take on this kind of "checklist"? 

And what are some things we could do to some of the risks [@viechdokter](/profile/viechdokter) highlights, which I take very seriously -- that there'd be further stratification of "insiders" and "outsiders" -- potentially in language, communication channels, implicit/assumed authority (liz probably has more to add here). I think we could do something like this, but want to think through how it could play out and plan ahead for such dynamics -- and consider all alternatives.
