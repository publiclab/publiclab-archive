[@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) Wow, clearly I need to look at Kickstarter more often. I'm pretty stumped about the soil and how they passed air so readily through that. I wonder if they thought that was lower maintenance than having a water based system? Or does the soil lend itself into helping to break down the pollutants because of micro-organisms? I do like the computer fan because some tech recycle places often have them. I'm already thinking of how you could create a magnetic ring or some screw on gasket to attach onto a plastic carton that you've cut a hole out of. Even though I'm a huge fan of microcontrollers, I feel like the more complicated the system is, the more ways it can break down, including app integration. It makes me think that for testing it is a nice option, but when it comes time for people to take care of it, it would be nice if it was simple.
