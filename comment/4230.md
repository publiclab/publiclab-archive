Hey VonK,

First thing that comes to my mind is I don't know what you mean by "disc tape", so I suggest first taking the disc tape filter off and see if the camera can see any picture.  If it can see without the filter, then the filter you're using doesn't let through any light the camera can detect and you need to try another filter.  Also, the camera has a little green light that comes on when it's sending information to the computer, does that light come on?  If removing the filter doesn't give you a picture, open the camera back up and see if there is anything obviously wrong with electronics (maybe you dropped something in there or bumped something that broke loose, etc.).  Keep in mind you can also plug the camera into your computer when it's taken apart, it will just have a blurry image if the lens isn't in place, just don't touch the circuitry with anything while the camera's plugged in.  Try those things, and let me know how it goes.
