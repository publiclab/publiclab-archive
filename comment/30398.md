In North Carolina is a military camp called camp Lejeune. For 30 years millions of marines and their families that lived on or next to the camp were exposed to carcinogenic chemicals in their drinking water. These chemicals in the water were fuel, benzene, TCE, PCE, CE, etc. and could cause cancers like leukemia, liver cancer, lung cancer, and many more. The camp then was sued for its detrimental effects to these families and marines as well as their knowledge of the quality of the water but their lack of action. About two decades later, in 1972 Congress passed the Clean Water Act (CWA). This act removes toxic substances from water and keeps the water clean. These two things relate because many other places were most likely affected by the same thing as the families of camp Lejeune. And camp Lejeune was probably one of the catalysts for making such an act because of the important of clean drinking water.
