One word of warning.  Solvents ( like acetone) and plastic cuvettes do not usually go together.  The worst case is the plastic melts, but the plastic will also smear, which also makes the cuvette unusable.  So the other choices are glass of quartz.  Quartz is the better choice, since it is good through the entire Uv/vis, but you will usually pay for the honor.  Glass should go below 400 nm without any problems, but double check the vendor specks to be sure.
