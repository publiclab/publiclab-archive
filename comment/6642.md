Tom,

Both [WarnerLkVis7075.JPG](http://fastie.net/Bin/12WarnerVIS/WarnerLkVis7075.JPG) and [WarnerLkVis7136.JPG](http://fastie.net/Bin/12WarnerVIS/WarnerLkVis7136.JPG) are there (case sensitive). Their NIR matches (2214 and 2275) are there too.

The NIR images have been passed through Adobe Lightroom, but only to add metadata -- the pixel data should not have been altered. The NIR camera was custom white balanced but was capturing color photos. So all three histograms (RGB) are completely overlapping and the photo appears as grayscale. The camera has a Wratten 87 IR filter, so only NIR above 735 nm made it to the sensor, but the Bayer filters had already done their thing.
