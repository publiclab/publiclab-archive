The alignment of the blue and red spectral response below 850nm that you are seeing is consistent with the spectral response curves that have been documented for other cameras, for instance at http://www.maxmax.com/camera_technical.htm. The low spectral sensitivity of the the green band is also consistent; however, note the comment on the maxmax page that the spectral response is different that the published spectral responses of the RGB-filtered channels at the sensor; that "may be due to other processing that occurs in the camera after you take a picture." For a stab in the dark, and to the best of my shaky understanding, the Bayer array has two green sensors in every 2x2 block to take advantage of the solar spectral maximum in the green for luminance (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter).  I *guess* that in the visible that using green as a component of chromaticity might require scaling down the relative contribution of the green pixels, e.g. by approximately 1/2. In the infrared there is no reason for doing this, and it seems to throw away useful spectral information.   If, as I understand the situation, the raw image literally contains the raw sensor readouts, it should be possible to recover more spectral sensitivity from the green band.  However, the de-mosaicing software for "developing" raw imagery was developed for visible images, so getting a better green channel requires more software modification than I know how to do.   (I've spent some trying to figure out how to fool Raw Therapee into giving up a better IR green band, without success)
