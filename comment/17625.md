Hi,
For the hardware you made, use the firmware here:https://github.com/SmokyMountainScientific/D_SeriesWheeStatFirmware/tree/master/WheeStat6_d.  You will need the program Energia which you can download from Energia.nu.  You will also need the altSPI library from our SmokyMountainScientific github page.  The user interface you want is the WheeStat6_e program which was written in Processing.  It looks like I failed to post a compiled version of this on GitHub.  If you are comfortable downloading Processing (processing.org) you can compile and export an application yourself.  If not, let me know and I will get an application for windows on the GitHub page when I get back to town (probably Tuesday).  Let me know how this goes.
