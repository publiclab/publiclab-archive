Chris, I'm not a expert user of the two cloudbased services, Dronemapper.com and Pix4d.com. I've only processed test cases. Pix4d.com, used to want the orientation data, but has relaxed the requirement. So both now accept images with the gps info coded into the EXIF info. Both make geo-referenced 2D mosaics and 3D surface models (with additional charges for the 3D models). These are not for everyone, but to me indicate where the professional surveying approach is going - fly the site, autoprocess the images, produce the map and model. There has been some discussion with Stewart and Jeff about whether our tools like Mapknitter could exploit the gps info, but not toward autoprocessing. To me, it's just another tool in the kit.
