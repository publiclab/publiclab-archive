[@amirberAgain](/profile/amirberAgain) - a friend just posted this question, and I'm curious if you think any of the steps you wrote out are applicable to that kind of analysis as well -- https://publiclab.org/questions/jlev/02-01-2018/how-can-i-identify-bits-of-plastic-from-the-beach-in-an-image

[@dakoller](/profile/dakoller) it'd be great to hear more about your interest in pollen too -- would you like to post it as a related question using the link under your comment? 

In general, I'm trying to think through how these steps could be laid out one by one, for potentially solving in a modular way, like using [ImageSequencer](http://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer), in parallel to what [@amirberAgain](/profile/amirberAgain) has done in Python -- with an eye to reusability across different similar challenges -- pollen, microplastics, dust. What do you think?
