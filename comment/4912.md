[The Rosco 2008](http://www.rosco.com/filters/SED.cfm?titleName=C2008:%20VS%20Indigo&imageName=../images/filters/cinegel/2008.jpg) should be one of the best filters for making NDVI because it blocks all the red light better than others. It has only 40% of the overall transmission of the 2007, so exposures will have to compensate by more than one f/stop.  It blocks a lot of the green light too, so false color Infrared (NBG) might be harder.

The first thing I would do is to make a floating point NDVI image, open it in Fiji, and apply the lut of choice to it. That might look different from the color NDVI produced by the plugin.
