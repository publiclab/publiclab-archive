[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) Thanks for your detailed explanation, that helped a ton! I do have the calibration targets from Mapir, unfortunately I need to assemble our own calibration system as theirs is not open and not useful for automated processing :)

If you don't mind, let me ask you one more question: is there a systematic way to evaluate channel bleeding? I would like to see if and how much of it happens with my cameras.
