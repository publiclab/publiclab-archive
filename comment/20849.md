Just going through here to offer a bit more input on the evolving design!

> Do you know who I ask about the copy (the text under the images)?

I think you could probably take the top line of each topic page - so try [#air-quality](/tag/air-quality) or [#water-quality](/tag/water-quality) -- although some of these may need editing to be honest. They could be pretty short text, though - the images are powerful.

On the tools, one reason to emphasize /methods instead of the store is that it highlights many more projects than we have in the store, but includes the ones in the store. I think we should emphasize "finding a place to get involved" or "a project to help out with" perhaps in directing people to this listing. 

+1 "we're in it together"! Great! ❤️ 

This has come some ways and I know you're eager for input. I'm going to ask a few others to pass their eyes over it and offer some input!

[@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2), [@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro), [@ann](/profile/ann) -- might any of you have some thoughts on [@edie_blues](/profile/edie_blues) design work here? Thank you if so!!!
