This looks helpful, i think it was the one we used: http://bildr.org/2011/02/mlx90614-arduino/

> To complicate things even more, the i2cmaster wont run on the Arduino out of the box, some files need to be renamed and changed, and an extra txt file is needed to get it working. But… because it is open-sourced I can make those changes, and redistribute it. So that’s what I’m going to do, I’m just giving it to you here in its working version to save you some time and headache. You will need to drop the library into your Arduino library folder for it to work, but we will get there.

> To make this code work, before you load the code, or even open the Arduino program, we need to place the “I2Cmaster” in your Arduino Library. If you don’t know where that is by default, Look to the right.

> Once the I2CMaster folder is in there, you can just go ahead and open MLX90614.pde in your Arduino software, and upload it.
