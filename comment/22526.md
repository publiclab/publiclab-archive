Hi Jeff and Everyone - 

Two papers you may want to look at, both open access.  One by Steve Hankey in EHP summarizing efforts that used bicycles and other methods, one by Joshua Apte using Aclima sensors on Google Street View vehicles.  Including the latter because the technology could presumably be adapted fairly easily for bicycles.  Both are pretty new, thus the references may also be interesting.  The Hankey paper has embedded live links back to the papers with more details on bicycle based monitoring.  Additionally, you may want to look at the presentations made on sensors at this year's annual Health Effects Institute conference.  

Cheers, Wig
