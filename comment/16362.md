I love this idea! It really highlights that this kind of intervention could be a way to make the diffuse impacts of indoor air quality quantifiable in a robust way, but without having to quantify which toxins are present (although we can do that as well).  These symptoms have been remarkably hard to tie to homes and toxicants. Knowing what plants and growth media foster which bacteria which degrade which toxicants will be important for making the results of this study even stronger. 

It's a whole kind of study design that is almost more like pharmaceutical trials. I wonder if we could do this in an analog way where we just puncture the diaphragm of a pump so it goes put pumps no air.

I'm not sure those fans will be able to move enough air to sufficiently diffuse the roots. The Andrea (pictured below) tried to do exactly that and consumer reports found that it really didn't do what it was supposed to. That's why i'm such a fan of the fish pump.

I wonder if there is a possibility of an arduino that is between the pump and the plant that allows air to go into the plant root or not, after the occupant logs their symptoms online every week. this is one way of doing randomization without massive scale called the N of 1 trial, an often overlooked model. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_of_1_trial

I think the ethical considerations are really important here, thank you for underlining those. Having a quick way to turn on the placebo devices should we find them to be conclusively effective seems like a vital consideration. 

What do we need to do to help move this idea closer to reality?
