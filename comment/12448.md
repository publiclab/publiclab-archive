[@Mathew](/profile/Mathew) and [@Danbeavers](/profile/Danbeavers) : Here is our balloon on its last legs. This is the best photo I could find of the balloon with the two patches (the pellet went straight through it), but by this point the balloon had lost a lot of the helium. Also the camera case in action, after many attempts with bottles and different fins. 

Hope this helps explain how we tried to solve the problems we had!
