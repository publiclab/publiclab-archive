 This is great, thanks so much for your proposal, [@lit2017001](/profile/lit2017001)! We've really appreciated your contributions over the past months. 

> I will begin by writing a manual for step by step usage of image Sequencer in regard to all its feature. This will ensure that people actually find and come across Image Sequencer and Public Lab. I will also work on spreading the word by writing Quora answers, making blog posts on platforms such as Medium. The main part of this improvement is making Image Sequencer as much performance-efficient as possible and to make it more and more user-friendly... Maybe next GCI we can make more and more themes for the project.

I love these ideas. Because modules are so compact, GCI has been a great way to grow our community, and also in general the architecture has been great for newcomers -- contributing just one module is not so hard. 

I'll note some of the same things I did in [@aashnaaashna](/profile/aashnaaashna)'s proposal! (https://publiclab.org/notes/aashnaaashna/04-03-2019/soc-proposal-image-sequencer#c23719) -- some priorities I think you have touched on and might add to as well --

> stabilizing the underlying image-sequencer project through testing, code coverage tracking, standardization. This will be critical as this project matures and you're right to see it as a prerequisite for more complex end-use cases!

> UI testing will have to be part of this too, as the increasingly complex UI work (which is sooooo useful) is also more brittle, and has been breaking more often!

And finally i wonder -- the optimizations will be awesome but perhaps you'd be interested in, towards the end of the summer, working on a real-world use case? 

> a real-world use case. I think that as we get more stability, these will increasingly tell the story of Image Sequencer to a wider audience, and people will start to see why we built it. There are lots of really interesting things that have become possible now that it has gotten so powerful, and this is a great opportunity to solve some real-world problems and ALSO show what IS is good at!

In any case, all of these will require collaborative work and a bit more structure and consistency in our library. I think they'll lay the groundwork for things like you mentioned:

> I believe this project can be helpful to small scale farmers and peasants where the health of their crops and soil can be analyzed and especially in a country like India where a majority of the people cannot afford to buy expensive equipment and pay loads of money for analysis.

This is a great vision, and I agree that our project has gotten to the point where we are moving faster in that direction!

I also appreciate that you are focused on different performance improvements. I think these will be really critical for many of the real-world use cases. 

Thanks for your proposal!!! 👍 👍 👍
