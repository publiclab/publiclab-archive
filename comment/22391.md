Hi [@wlkwong](/profile/wlkwong)!</br>
I've built my personal mini spectrometer using a 1" PVC tube. The collimation slit is attached to a 1" cap so I can pull it out and rotate the orientation of the slit. Here are two pictures of the same source of light reflected on a white surface. The first one has the slit as the foldable mini spectrometer. For the second one I've  rotated the collimation slit 90 degrees.</br>
I'm not an expert so I leave the analysis to the senior spectrometer fellas ;)

ps: Sorry but trying to change the picture, now I'm having troubles with the uploader. Find the PICTURE HERE
