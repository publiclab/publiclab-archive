Hi guys, I´ve been reading this posts and they are very helpfull for me as well, but I am having some problems also with the PhotoMonitoring. When I go to the "Dual Image NDVI Processing" I don´t have the option of "NDVIBLue2Red.lut" option on the output color table. 
already thanks for any help....
