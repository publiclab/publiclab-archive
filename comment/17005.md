I checked on the Mini Pearl logger in the compost pile today and swapped SD cards. It was still logging after 7.5 days, so that's a new record. I need to start using the compost, so I removed some of it to spread on the garden. The rest of it I mixed with fresh grass clippings and weeds I pulled from the garden. The sensors are back in the center of the pile and the Mini Pearl is logging again.

*Above: Four temperature records from the Mini Pearl logger at the compost pile. Two sensors are in the center of the pile and one sensor is in the air next to the pile. The real time clock (RTC) is in a Nalgene bottle with the Mini Pearl logger. The logger is under a white styrofoam cooler, but it is in direct sunlight for several hours and apparently can get hotter than the official air temperature would.*

I have not measured the sleep current of this logger with this array of sensors, so I don't know how long it might last on a set of four AAA eneloop batteries. I did not change the batteries today, so we might eventually get an answer.
