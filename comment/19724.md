The coming Monday doesn't work for me, how about Tuesday, June 5th at 13:00 EST? Maybe a bit later and just before the openhour? The esiest option for me is to use the Hangouts, but we could also set a zoom meeting.
The main subject I want to discuss is the plan and goals for the rest of the summer and see if there are any questions you might have that I could help with. [@icarito](/profile/icarito) does that work for you as well?
