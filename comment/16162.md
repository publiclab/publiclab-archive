This is so exciting to see. [@stef](/profile/stef), would you be willing to post a response using the "Document your attempt to build this" button above the [builds](#builds) section above?

[@rthalman](/profile/rthalman) and [@stef](/profile/stef), how long do you think this took to make, and how difficult was it? There are some extra tags we can add to flesh out how this build is shown on the site.
