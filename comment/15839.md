I note that 1) your spectrum does "fit" though it is 2) "offset" a bit from center which is likely related to the angle. (Just to identify what is seen; not that the effect is huge.) The broad "hump" in the 'blue' background level suggests possible light leakage, optical path skew, or some distortion -- the background (between the spikes) ideally is close to zero.

As for camera focus, the practical answer is: where the resolution of the green double-peak is the sharpest. When the distance from the slit to the grating is "longer", the slit behaves more like a 'point source' so the camera focus is closer to infinity. But these tiny, polycarbonate lenses are poor, have significant aberration and large DOF so the focus point will be just a guess at best (the effect of focus adjust on the clarity of the spectral won't be dramatic) and so final performance will be limited.
