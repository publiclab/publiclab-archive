Well, someone will be able to publish the procedure, but many people will use it. To store the current state of the procedure, so that people can "return to it" and we can store aggregated data generated by the procedure, we'll need both the procedure template and the procedure "run", which stores one copy of someone having actually run through the procedure, make sense? 

I guess we'd just want to be sure there's a consistent design between the "inline capture" you're proposing and the overall capture interface. We might want to start just by redirecting to capture with some parameters (like 'procedure_run=32432'), and redirecting back, so that we don't have to refactor the capture interface to work inline. Later, we can refine that to be more seamless. How about that?
