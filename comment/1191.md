Hmmm... I'm trying to remember what the differences would be with an absorption experiment.  Maybe I'm missing something, but as far as I can think, the equal-area/normalization feature would be useful for any time you're comparing two or more spectra.  The purpose is to compare the spectra as if the total amount of light were the same for each one, making it easier to see or calculate the differences.  This is especially helpful if you move your experiment or take it apart and reassemble it between taking the spectra, or even more so for us to compare spectra with each other.  I think this would be useful for absorption spectra as much as with fluorescence, it just depends on what you're looking for in your experiment.

So, for example, if you want to see which source emits or absorbs the highest amount of yellow light, you don't want to normalize the data, that would skew the results.  If you want to compare which source has the highest percentage of yellow light compared to other colors in the source, regardless of the total output of the source, then you definitely want to normalize the data.
