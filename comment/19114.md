My first reaction is that I don't think repeating questions is that bad: our community is built around providing ways for people to actively engage, and I think that stepping in to a conversation by asking a question is one way people choose to do that. I also don't think it's necessarily a bad think to have multiple posts/questions on the same topic: the content on our dashboards scrolls by pretty quickly and I have a feeling that there are different people seeing and responding to questions at different times: our knowledge base is growing all the time, so it's likely that even simple questions might have new or better or different kinds of answers from month to month. We provide the "ask a question" field *before* the "view questions by topic" option, which may suggest to some that it's a first step. 

That said, I think our search function has some nuances to it that might not be intuitive to a new user, so even if a person *does* perform an initial search for what they're looking for, fine-tuning or searching within groups of results can be a challenge, especially if you're not familiar with the site/community and might not know off the bat how research notes, activities or wikis differ. 

I *would* love to see a way to merge closely related questions so that great responses can be colocated. That way I think we could start building out an FAQ that might be a great first-stop for some users.
