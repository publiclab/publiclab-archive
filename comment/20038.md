I absolutely agree with your concerns about putting human health and safety first, I guess I'm thinking more about cases that a lot of us have experienced (like in the aftermath of storm events), where people are going to be spending time in proximity with the immediate and ongoing effects of a disaster because the places where they live or work are feeling the impact... I too would be wary of advising anyone to collect samples without an informed understanding of what they might be getting in to. I suppose part of what I'm interested in is what people would have wanted to do differently, or wished they had been aware of in cases where they've  been involved in some form of disaster response.
