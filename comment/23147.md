Although I am having problems with the geometry of the spectrometer, I was able to use a split DVD and get a spectra.  No purple.

Once I get my spectrometer working, i will post a bit more of details.  I ended up getting some DVD-R also, to insure my problems were related to geometry, not DVDometry, lol, my new word.
