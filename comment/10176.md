Hi Matthew..  I don't see why not... It might take a slight adaptation, one that I had already considered doing anyway... using the raspiCam instead of the CCD Array... The only problem I can think of would be using Spectral Workbench on a raspberryPi.. I haven't tried very hard, but I wasn't successful last time I tried.  
I plan on releasing several (about 3 or 4) versions of the spectrometer that are graduating levels of complexity... Such as the first using a raspiCam or webcam, the second using something like a photo-diode array and the third, which you see here using a CCD array..  One might also use a PC instead of a raspberryPi.. There's really no reason the spectrometer portion cannot be plugged via usb into a host PC..  
In addition to that, I am taking requests...  :)  I want this to be as open and easy for people as possible, if anyone has suggestions, I am all ears!!
