Thanks for the links!

Epilog: after pricing out individual filters for doing a filter wheel, I don't think I could beat the price of this one pixel sensor, which also doesn't require all the labor that a filter wheel would require.  A company or organization might (?) be able to make filter wheels at a lower cost than the pixel sensor through bulk orders and such, but I doubt an individual like me could beat the cost by procuring filters individually.  So, ixnay to the filter wheel.

That being said, mounting a monochrome camera behind a filter wheel would produce pictures, not just one pixel, in different spectra, and so you could potentially harvest a lot more information.
