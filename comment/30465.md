A hydrosphere is the total amount of water on a planet. The hydrosphere includes water that is on the surface of the planet, underground, and in the air. The hydrosphere is made mostly of saltwater oceans and seas and is the largest biome on Earth. Its environment consist of biotic organisms such as whales, manatees, and seahorses, and aquatic plants. Marine plants provide more than half the oxygen on earth. Freshwater biomes are filled with water that has extremely low levels of salt. Fish, frogs, otters, turtles, beavers, etc. live in freshwater biomes. About 71 percent of the Earthâ€™s surface is covered with water. However, 97 percent is salt water. This year 538,250 deaths were caused by water related diseases. This is an concern that Public Lab is greatly invested in.
