Mathew, that diagram is a little misleading. A lens with a 45° field of view (focal length of 44mm equiv.) would capture a photo with a long side equal to 82% of the camera height. Most point and shoot cameras can be zoomed into 44mm and that would improve resolution. But most Powershots have a lens with about 24mm to 37mm focal length widest zoom which produce 74° to 52° field of view (respectively). 

In your Answer text I think you meant 45° not 90°, but the proper range is about 52° to 74°.
