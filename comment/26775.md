My question is really about current workflows for gas chromatography / mass spectrometry for environmental monitoring.  Part of what we are trying to do is evaluate current options for testing grab samples, with the goal of sharing an updated resource list of labs that will perform gc-ms for community groups using the bucket.   In my research so far, it looks like 1) most gas phase sensors that the EPA is looking at aren't even using gc-ms for testing, but at the same time 2) gc-ms *is* commonly used as an option for environmental monitoring, including tools that can be used in the field for forensics and emergency response  (which sounds, at a minimum, like maybe things have become more cost-effective?   that would be a big deal, sample analysis is expensive)

TLDR: I'm trying to get a handle on gc-ms is used for air sample analysis and the workflows involved.   I'd love feedback on either question!
