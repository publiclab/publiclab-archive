[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) It is possible to use binary ICA if only the peaks are known. However, in binary ICA all smooth continuous spectra would look nearly the same, it throws away a lot of information so I would expect the results to be much less accurate.
Calibrating the camera's image sensor so the the intensities are at least proportionally correct seems feasible, but I think it would require being able to photograph something with known intensities, which might not be easy to find. Maybe this could be accomplished by including standardized glow in the dark rainbow strips with the public lab spectrometers? Thanks for the fluorescent bulb suggestion. Are the emission peak databases you mentioned behind a pay-wall? And do they only include the peak locations?
I'm glad you're happy with the macro :)
