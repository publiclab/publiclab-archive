If it was my house, and no one was listening to me, i'd attempt to create an odor log: https://publiclab.org/wiki/odor. I'd get whatever was ready-to-hand, either a piece of paper or an online spreadsheet. As the link above recommends, I'd make a row for every day, don't skip days without smell, but definitely do list dates and times/duration of the smell. Also list any health symptoms like fatigue, headache, irritation to breathing or eyes, etc.
I'd also put the dates of flooding in the basement, maybe highlighted in a different color.
