Hi, Don - sorry, you never wrote back so I hadn't changed the title until now - it now says "Coqui" only - thanks. 

The conclusion you draw: 

>  it seems like it can push us around the typical range of tap water by as much as 15% of the expected range.

is great, even if you have since drawn a more precise conclusion. And the graphics are super helpful! Could you add them to the Coqui page, which is a bit sparse on these kinds of limitations at the moment? It mentions "conductivity" but not whether it's absolute or comparative, and not how it's affected by temperature etc. I added a [Status and Limitations](/wiki/oil-testing-kit#Status+&+Limitations) section to the Oil Testing Kit as we talked about on Wednesday; maybe these could be part of such a section on the Coqui page, too. 

Hi, [@GreenChemist](/profile/GreenChemist) - I don't know - do you have more information about that? If so, I don't think this would test for that, just the metals.
