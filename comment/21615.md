 Ah, it doesn't look like this poster has shared anything else on the PL site, but you can try contacting them directly (if you leave a comment on the research note and @ their name, they should get an alert).

What are you hoping to count? I see that there are some other open source cell-counting projects out there-- would something like this be useful? http://opencfu.sourceforge.net/
