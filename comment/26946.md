_The histogram of one of the channels was probably stretched (one or more extreme points at either end removed and the rest stretched to fill the 0-255 range)._

Sorry I don't really understand this one, how can I fix that so my result can be as vibrant as yours?

You ever said that the red channel is contaminated by NIR, how can I solve that?

When I point my camera to the card using auto white balance, nothing changed. And when I change it manually, the plant's color couldn't be like your example no matter how I change it. Could you please explain how you usually do the white balancing?
