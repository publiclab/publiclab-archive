Pascal,
These are some really good ideas you are proposing. I am very interested in multiple, bracketed exposures to get more dynamic range. This would lend itself to my workflow which involves taking still images with a Canon Powershot and uploading these later to SWB. It would be easy to instruct CHDK to take 3 or 5 bracketed photos of each spectrum. If SWB allowed dragging in 5 bracketed photos of one spectrum and did the analysis to make one spectral graph, it would add lots of power to my workflow, and produce much higher quality spectra.

I don't know how this could be applied to a more typical SWB user sending a video feed to SWB for capture. Unless the browser can control the web cam, the user would have to vary the exposure manually and the browser would have to capture frames of varying brightness.  Can the user's computer adjust the exposure of the webcam? Can this be done remotely through the browser?  I don't know enough about the system to understand how this would work. If it can be automated it could result in a fantastic improvement of spectral quality for most contributions to SWB.
