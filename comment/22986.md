Some colleagues from Australia have been working on AirRater (https://airrater.org/) and we're working towards adapting it for specific projects.
It's goal is to support asthmatics in Tasmania to deal with pollen and woodsmoke issues but as a platform to record your perceptions on air quality is a good starting point.
My team have been trying to get this information from the participants in our community-based air quality project (http://www.niwa.co.nz/cona ) and we did that with a simple survey that we asked people to respond every day ... mixed results.
Happy to share what our questions were and to collaborate with anyone interested in gathering these kinds of information.
