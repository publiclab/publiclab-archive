Hi [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) - thanks, i'm thinking of an activity which young people could do in a group, over the course of a month or so, to create a map of a waterway, using only pH test strips. And whether such a detailed timeseries-map (given that it's pretty inexpensive to test lots of sites on the map periodically) would be useful in identifying some common pollution types as well as linking them to a source. Thanks!
