Following an initial brief posting in early December (cold snap conditions), I re-posted the camera the third week in February attempting to precede warm-ups and snow-melt runoff events.

Since I've set-up a single daily time lapse photo format, I'd anticipate a 4 month battery shelf life.

I'll provide set-up photos along with additional stream/wetland photos this weekend.

Thanks for the interest -- additional feedback is most welcome!
