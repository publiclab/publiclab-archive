This comment on a question about wastewater (including sewage) has some info on odors: https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/07-28-2021/what-are-some-observable-tell-tale-signs-of-wastewater-pollution#c29094. 

And this research note about identifying odors commonly associated with different compounds might offer some clues? It breaks down different smells and their health effects: https://publiclab.org/notes/kgradow1/10-31-2020/smells-that-kill-how-to-identify-odours
