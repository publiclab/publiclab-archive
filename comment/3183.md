AH! FINALLY GOT IT!

Calibrate must be done on the PC.

Step 1:  Before the begin step, there are instructions! This warns that NEXT, we will click on the highest blue point.  So this should be step 1

Step 2: After clicking begin, there is no prompt.  We get the same image as before we started, tricking us into thinking the "begin" operation failed.  In fact, we are expected to preform the action we were prompted for a step earlier. Clicking the blue band moves the progress forward.  

After this, the process follows the similar pattern. 

Maybe this should be put in the actual sequence?

OK, on to see if it worked....
