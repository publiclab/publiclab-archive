I just took some colored pieces of paper I found at the office. The paper squares was only added to show other people that I didnt just re color the image but actia√∂ly took images of different lightwaves than pne can be used to see from consumer cameras. 
I also did the calibration by using my gui application where I could manually set the properties of the camera.
