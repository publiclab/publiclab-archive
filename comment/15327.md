I see [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)'s point about expecting Observe to come a little later in this list. Could we change the order we list it in?

Also [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie), i agree it's a lot to ask people to tag this to their own notes. There's a "tagging support" interface being worked up to help people understand these and see their research in a larger context. I'm guessing we'll probably be working up some orientation materials as well in the posting form and in the signup confirmation. 

In terms of most notes fitting multiple categories, maybe now and moving forward, people can be more modular about how they post, so that it's clearer to others what can be built upon, and how. 

What do people think about that?
