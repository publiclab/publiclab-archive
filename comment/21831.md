Hi [@kahlilkochiyama](/profile/kahlilkochiyama) and [@shannonkmcalpine](/profile/shannonkmcalpine)    Some suggestions for beginning questions for air monitoring in the Los Angeles area: There are many government air quality monitors working in the LA area, see
https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=dd4a15deed8647edacb14f140ca83d05
for instance, in addition to the many people with Purple Air Monitors with data shown on the PurpleAir map:
https://www.purpleair.com/map#1/25/-30
with data publicly available.
 So to get an indication of what you are interested in and possible solutions as well as your own knowledge I would ask: what do you find lacking in the data from these monitors? and what more would you want?  One more initial question would be: are you also interested in using air quality in a community organizing project?  Detailed answers would be helpful. Thanks.
