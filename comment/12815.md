hi [@guolivar](/profile/guolivar), thanks for the suggestions, i had a look at the ODIN and PACMAN and see that you use the Sharp sensor, which i believe outputs a voltage proportional to micrograms/m3. i will add one to my DustDuino to see how the 2 sensors compare. i'm not too optimistic after reading your article https://www.niwa.co.nz/sites/niwa.co.nz/files/The%20Outdoor%20Dust%20Information%20Node%20(ODIN)%20-%20Development%20and%20first%20tests.pdf (day time 30% correlation only!)
