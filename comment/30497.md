The Burmese Python is a dangerous species who has spread across the Florida Everglades. This species is 23 feet long and can consume something as big as an alligator.  The impact these pythons have on the ecosystem is crazy because they have now become the apex predator due to their size and what they consume. The average female Burmese python lays about 122 eggs, and is the bigger species compared to the males. These pythons are being hunted down so they can become extinct and experimented on because of how dangerous they are to the ecosystems.  Thanks to public labs for letting spread info.
