Hi rfdave. To my knowledge the only requirements is that the electrodes be inert. I chose graphite because I had some laying around and its cheap. I would think a high grade stainless steel would work fine for low salinity waters and probably higher salinity waters for short periods of time. High salinity waters usually tend to be harsher, and I think if you want to deploy a sensor for an extended period of time stainless steel would start to corrode.
