Perfect summary, [@warren](/profile/warren). Now that OpenDroneMap can handle ortho generation for images with GPS ephemeris, the next step is to look at Leaflet.DistortableImage as an interface for ODM for referencing. I have an upcoming research note specifically on georeferencing, because it's a really interesting problem for this use case, with some deviations from the Leaflet.DistortableImage / MapKnitter solutions.
