Nicely done. I love the old beat up Kodak packages ([but check out this one](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Kodak-Wratten-24A-Gelatin-75mm-Square-Filter-NEW-UNOPENED-/111060134934?pt=Camera_Filters&hash=item19dbb32c16)). Did you get it on eBay? How much? You must have a lot left over for doing internal conversions.

It's probably okay to white balance in direct sunlight, because the more red the better. But your photo looks good. Here is the histogram. Good separation of blue (NIR) and red:

I think you processed the Wratten image like an infrablue image. Here is an NDVI image using the blue channel for NIR and red for red:

Infragram.org does not have an easy way to process Wratten 25 (SuperRed?) photos. I couldn't figure out how to do it at the new and improved Infragram sandbox.
