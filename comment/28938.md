While inexpensive tests will always be the need ( as in test strips) the group should transition to more sophisticated tests, as possible.  This would include tests using the spectrometer and other instruments.  Please note though, a spectrometer is the base component of a number of other instruments.  Some of them have already been touched on by public lab ( aa, ae, etc).  Whether these would be acceptable to a regulatory agency is possible, but doubtfull.  But they would be good training tools and allow testing for much less than a commercial lab. We cant escape the commercial lab testing. We can  just  minimize it.
