What is the status of this project/ how can I potentially participate? I just found Public Lab today and joined and would love to learn more about participating in particular projects like this! I am a high school teacher and wouldn't mind getting kids involved. Plus, I really want to augment my own routine by participating in ecology-based research. I live and teach near the LA river and I would love to find out more about what you need help with!
