Thx for the information!

-Really like the interface, just fine tuning its application.
-After a little experimentation,  the interface can capture/load large format images if the Quality setting is adjusted to 100.  its buried in the [RPi-Cam-Web-Interface](https://elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface) link you provided above: 

"There are 2 settings to control quality and compression. Quality (1-100) controls the quality of the live image preview, and image_quality (1-100) controls quality of still image captures. The number does not match normal jpeg Q factor as the Raspberry camera compression software Q factor is quite non linear. The default 10 is approximately equivalent to 75 in normal JPEG usage and gives a decent trade-off between quality and file size. 7 is about Q 50, and 20 is about Q 95."

-I have been able to download large formats from v1.3 and 2.1 with no problems (with the Quality setting=100).   I plan to post some pictures soon. 

-The only problem I have now is that the my pi-zero  locks up after about 20 minutes.   Its behavior becomes  erratic - the WiFI may not connect, may not store images or can't access commands).   Have you ever had any problems with overheating?   Since the camera mount prevents adding the supplied heat sink, not sure how to fix? 

Thx again  for your detailed response.
