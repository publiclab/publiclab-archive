Dry fog technology utilizes a chemical disinfection process: the system vaporizes the sporicidal chemical, producing very fine droplets of disinfectant which are dispersed throughout a room, without any manual efforts. ... The dry fog solution is evenly and completely dispersed in the room or rooms. We need to be able to determine that the CFU (n microbiology, a colony-forming unit (CFU, cfu, Cfu) is a unit used to estimate the number of viable bacteria or fungal cells in a sample. Viable is defined as the ability to multiply via binary fission under the controlled conditions. ... Expressing results as colony-forming units reflects this uncertainty.) has been reduced to predetermined level of either 3-Log or 6-Log reduction i.e. 99.9% of 99.9999%
