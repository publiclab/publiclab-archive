This answer coming in from [@wicca](/profile/wicca) :  Look to the side of the roads/taking photos over time and see the sand increasing over a few days. Where there is sand there is dust. Too simplistic? People need to know that where there is the sand there is the dust; the sand drops but the dust travels for miles. I would think a simple filter would work ... paper filters? Like those used in coffee makers? OR ... of course the gold standard would be set up a monitor. 
Question: Why would dust accumulation of a roadway be highly significant? What are they trying to prove?
