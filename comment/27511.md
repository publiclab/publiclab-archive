Markos, thanks for your interest! If you're wanting to explore potentiostats I'd recommend looking at the WheeSat (by Prof. Jack Summers and Smoky Mt. Scientific) which is what we're using. If you have interest in embedded AI applications then we could talk and see if there's a way for this to fit with your studies.
