Hey Mathew - based on your feedback, I put together a shorter amount of text which touches on the main steps but is more an introduction than a guide. 

I agree about interpretation, but at this point, we're not there yet in this tool's development. I think the most we can confidently say is that "low red color correlates with crop stress" and the same with "cool" areas of an NDVI image. Part of the New Hampshire cropcover trials project is to get better at interpreting infrared, so I think we'll make progress on that soon, but we just aren't there yet (beyond simply reading and regurgitating the remote sensing literature, which is typically not on the same scale as our data).
