I have had a similar issue.
I have built mine, and it works.
Have downloaded to the computer, no problem.
But cannot seem to be the program to process the results.
Have tried many times, with no results.
However, it is a pretty cool thing, and feel that I will be using it a lot.
Thanks, Rob C.
