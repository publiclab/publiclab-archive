Will Macfarlane ([@wmacfarl](/profile/wmacfarl)) kept working on this and has a more compact version which we're not quite sure works. There may be a problem with the 555s themselves, but I like how compact this is. It doesn't have the features of Don's more complex version here: http://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/10-18-2014/coqui-pcb-audio-jack but Parts and Crafts has been using it. I'll upload a photo soon.
