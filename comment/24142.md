 I just noticed that at least some of the 2000 era Olympus Camedia cameras did not have an effective IR cut filter installed. For normal photography I don't know how they compensated for the NIR that reached the sensor, but [some people](https://aaronel.com/aaronel-and-the-olympus-c2020z/) used a filter that blocked all or most visible light and did infrared photography with Camedia cameras. I think the exposure times were 1 to 20 seconds. This is probably a poor solution for aerial photography.
