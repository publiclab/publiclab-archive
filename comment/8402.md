Hi everyone. 
   I just wanted to post an update as I have done some major code development for the Cave Pearl data logger recently, and a weeks worth of power draw tests have given me a real world idea of how much power it takes to buffer your sensor readings to an I2C eeprom. 
   Essentially 192 block writes(&reads) on an AT24C32 eeprom + 1 SD card write, uses twice as much power as 8 SD card writes.  I really did not have any sense of what these numbers were going to be be before trying out this little experiment. Anyone interested, and using an arduino based datalogger, might want to look a the scripts for some ideas for their own project.

Cheers!
