 solaria, great work, much kudos deserved. A rigorous experiment. 

Like david_uwi, I wondered at why sucrose is absorbing visible light (VL) at all, being colourless. Bit of digging and it seems sucrose is a big player in the IR (https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C57501&Type=IR-SPEC&Index=0#IR-SPEC) and has detectable absorbance in the near-IR. Likewise in the UV it is detectable. The ResearchGate sucrose absorption graphic is linked to another method for determining sucrose concentration (viscocity) and I wasn't able to quickly verify that data. 

The water samples showing a log absorbance of 0.005 (about 1% relative) for 0.3mol/L are cool. 1% is not a lot to go on to detect a "hella lotta" sucrose in a beaker. 

The fact you have got such consistent data showing an absorbance of around 0.06 on the log scale (or close to 15% relative ?) in the wine confounds me a bit. Anthocyanins (colour compounds in grapes) are a complicated beast and I have a suspicion that they are reacting to the large increase in sucrose. They are an excellent predictor of acidity/fruitiness (wine tasting 101). I don't think the yeast/fermentation hypothesis is correct. Even "Double Dog Dare Cabernet Sauvignon" would not have residual viable yeast, as rough as it sounds :). Try the whole experiment again using increasing amounts of tartaric acid instead of sugar to see those anthocyanins at work.

A few thoughts on this. Putting 6-7 teaspoons of sugar into a tumbler (250mL) of red wine doesn't need spectroscopy to detect ! I note what I said 4 years ago, dry red wine (so almost all) doesn't have residual sugar. Certainly not in the 0.3mol/L range. Wine grape sugars are fructose and glucose anyway. Why are we confusing the detection of sugar (sucrose) by using a wine sample ? If it is to detect the addition of sugar (legal in the EU, illegal here in Australia, but plenty of ways around it, concentrated grape juice being one) then the horse has bolted, the sugar is no longer sugar but alcohol after fermentation.

Lots of research about measuring sugars (all types) in soft drink, honey and blood. Different strategies, really interesting stuff. With the recent publicised honey contamination issues analysis of honey seems very worthwhile

but mostly it seems they use IR or UV.

Interestingly, the blood sugar level in blood (for diabetics) can be done using spectroscopy.

Thanks again solaris, great to read and ponder on your work.
