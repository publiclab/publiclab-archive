Hi [@purpleairfan](/profile/purpleairfan)! You might find some ideas in this related question and its comment section: [https://publiclab.org/questions/eustatic/01-20-2021/how-do-we-get-relevant-pm-data-to-residents-in-under-10-minutes](https://publiclab.org/questions/eustatic/01-20-2021/how-do-we-get-relevant-pm-data-to-residents-in-under-10-minutes)

There's also a comment here from a community member who set up push notifications from Purple Air data: https://publiclab.org/notes/jiteovien/08-28-2018/download-analyze-your-purple-air-data#c26424 

Hopefully something in there can help and fit with the time resolution you'd need!
