Thank you so much Chris , I try to take some new photo with MOBIUS and then publish it .
Sorry again the same question as before: in this case , which color sccale should I use to evaluate and measure the results ?
In your experience , which modified camera, it is more efficient to get NDVI images ?
Thanks again for everything that you share! 
Monoxyde.
