Thank you for the suggestion. There seems to be a catch-22 with every GSM option.  The SIM900/900a solutions are more common but seem to have different many libraries which may or may not be well maintained.  The advantage of the "official" GSM Shield made by Arduino is it is supported by a default GSM library that comes bundled with Arduino IDE since 1.0.4.  Perhaps most importantly, it comes with its own SIM Card/service plan. The main issue with this option seems to be less of a hardware problem and much more of a programming concern.  Something that could probably be overcome if I had more expertise in the very specific area of programming for software serial communications.  I posted about the issue on the Arduino forum about a year ago- http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=187278.0 but nobody seems to have come up with any workarounds yet...
  In any case, its looking more and more like mesh is a better networking option for our demo project.  GSM will be useful as a backup in the future.
