Hi, i think your message somehow got deleted? But i got it by email. 

Actually the Pi camera doesn't connect to a computer by USB as a webcam in general, although we've tried to make progress on that via linux kernel modifications: https://github.com/publiclab/pi-builder/issues/56

In the meantime, the software available at https://publiclab.org/pi-builder can let you connect to a Raspberry Pi via a webpage, and save images from it. We are trying in the Spectral Workbench Capture project to make this integrate with Spectral Workbench itself, but it's an ongoing project. 

In the meantime, you can save images, then upload them via http://spectralworkbench.org/upload

This isn't ideal, but it's what's possible with a Raspberry Pi today -- hopefully soon the open source community will come up with some better solutions, and we're doing what we can to push that forward!
