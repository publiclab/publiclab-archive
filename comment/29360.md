Hi Contributors!!
I want to add some information regarding the project of the Public lab "Spectral Workbench". Spectral Workbench is a separate Rails app at [https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/), but it's linked in to share the same login system as PublicLab.org, since it's a specialty tool for users in our community and we didn't want separate logins.
And, it has its own pure JavaScript library containing much of the complex part of the UI and front-end, at [https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/), which is an NPM module too, and that is "installed" into the Rails app, so as to keep the JavaScript and Ruby code distinct. I hope it helps you when you start contributing to this project. Thanks!
Happy Coding!
