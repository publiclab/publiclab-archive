Do you mean that the probe you used for testing your device (borrowed from UMass CEE dept.) was the Accumet AP85 or do you mean that you bought the Accumet AP85 and have incorporated either just the probe, or the probe and meter into your arduino device? Specifically I am interested in the circuitry that you have your probe (the arduino based conductivity meter) hooked up to, and the probe itself. Is there a post about your work designing the conductivity meter? Perhaps it is this (http://publiclab.org/wiki/555-conductivity-meter) one? Thanks!
