Hi  tagorecaue.
I did not try different lenses any more. I checked my camera result with a farmer who uses a ndvi camera of a university and my result where close to his. But I stopped this project. Reason I want something smaller and lighter for my drone. And I do not need 12-16 mega pixel resolution. 
I'm currently working on a cape for a beaglebone black which will house two 5 mega pixel camera. The idea is to house it in a 3d printed housing which will hang under my drone.  Working on using opencv for image overlay. My idea is that my new camera system should be stiff enough to not to do a image matching every time. Only need to do a calibration once. This will make the software much faster. Also did not use a gimbal to save weight. But watch out with very strong winds. The result will not be uniform.

When I have some results with my beaglebone will post it. But still alot of coding to do. Linux kernel space can be a pain in the but.
Grayson.

When I have some results I will post it here.
