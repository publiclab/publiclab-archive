Hey  mlamadrid, the "freezing" method can work as long as you you drop the temp down to -20C, or you can use a  clevenger apparatus, which is a glass separating pear shaped funnel. 

Pass the oil through a bed of sodium sulphate in the funnel, the water will be absorbed by the sodium sulphate and the oil will pass down thru the funnel.
