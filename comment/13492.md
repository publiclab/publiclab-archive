Glad this note is helpful. Between using a "clean" CFL spectrum for wavelength calibration, a sharp narrow slit, performing a gain-correction and building-in mechanical stability I think the present webcam's hardware performance is limited to 400-650nm with 2-3nm resolution. I don't know the SWB's algorithm criteria for "quality fit" to know if the limit is resolution or noise.
