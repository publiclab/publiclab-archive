Thanks, do you have a link? I don't know, but I wonder if local community orgs may want to be extra vigilant about the EPA's data on these incidents. At least we should be sure we know exactly what the EPA says they know, and be able to compare with on-the-ground reporting from folks doing grassroots organizing to monitor incidents. 

Thanks, [@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2)!
