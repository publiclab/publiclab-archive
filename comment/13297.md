Ok, if you look back up above in THIS research note, you will see an Update I have added which includes a single combined plot set using my PLab-3 proto with the new camera and shows the 4700K Solux Gain-Correction curves. The curve data is also included as a set of .TXT files. I've included the 400-650nm correction; although the errors "blow-up" at either end of the webcam's wavelength sensitivity response curve. To use the gain-correction curve data (which is listed for 300-800nm in 1nm increments) just multiply:  corrected_val = int16( double(PLab-3_val) * GainCorrection ) for every wavelength of interest. The result can be re-scaled if necessary. I used an arbitrary 530nm as the point to set the gain-correction to 1.0.
