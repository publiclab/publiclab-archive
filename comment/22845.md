The signature of ripe coconuts might be distinguishable from some of the other things in the photos, but not necessarily everything else in the photos. Are ripe coconuts brown? With a good red channel and good NIR channel, a brown coconut can probably be distinguished from a live palm frond. Palm fronds are geometrically complex and will cast shadows and have bright highlights, so will not have a simple VIS/NIR signature. Dead or dying fronds, stems, and sheathes might have a signature which is very similar to ripe coconuts, and tree trunks and ground surfaces might also be similar. If it is obvious to a human that some trees in a photo are loaded with ripe coconuts and others are not, image analysis can probably be used to replicate that observation. Including near infrared information might make that analysis easier.
