Warren, looking at your post (and specifically the size of the camera you are referring to, you could easily interface that by just attaching it to the end of the camera port in my design (I did something similar with one of my prototypes with an older webcam that I had removed from its case - I just taped it on). The Microsoft cam was a good one because it has a ruond body (and I have read about this camera being used with a telescope, so its optics are pretty good: http://dslrmodifications.com/lifecam/lifecam1.html).
