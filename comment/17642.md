Hi [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke)!  Sorry for the much-delayed reply :) and thanks for the comment.  I, too, liked this approach -- basically, using the difference in the amplitude of back-scattered light, between the 'LED-on' and 'LED-off' states as a measure of turbidity -- for how simple it was.  In retrospect, however, I might worry whether that measured difference would remain the same depending on how much stray light is entering the system. One problematic scenario, for example: if there is so much stray light that it 'maxes out' the sensor -- in that case, the 'LED-on' case wouldn't even register at all (though I suppose one could detect this condition in software, and simply report an error in this case).  There's also the possible issue that the measured difference might not be remain the same as the stray light amplitude changes -- perhaps due to some non-linear response of the sensor, say (though this could be tested -- and, if it's a problem, perhaps some calibration process could account for it).

Anyway:  as you point out, the setup is indeed on the 'simple' side (just buy the sensor from Adafruit, and an LED) of things, relatively speaking -- so it might not take too much effort to test it out in different stray light conditions, and see whether my worries above are well-founded ...

Cheerio!
