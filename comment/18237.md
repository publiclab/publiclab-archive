Hi dannysmith - I’m glad to hear the note was useful to get you started. I find it helpful to plot both red and blue channel regressions but I expect you would be fine with only one. You need to calculate the regression for both red and blue so plotting the two isn't that much extra work. Having two is a bit of a reality check that things are working as expected. In your case the red channel will be recording NIR and since the camera wasn’t designed for NIR I figure there could be some unexpected behavior. As far as using a an incident light sensor to bypass the target calibration I think that could be possible but I would do some tests before making that jump. With rigorously calibrated research-grade multispectral detectors/cameras that approach is used but there is an assumption the the sensor is quite stable, especially with regard to changes in air temperature. With an inexpensive point and shoot or pi camera that is likely not a valid assumption. At least that’s what a lot of folks seem to think. It would be great if you could do some tests and report back.
