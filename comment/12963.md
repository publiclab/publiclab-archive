OK, revisions:

* thinner
* shorter (but short enough?)
* on a millimeter grid
* curved tabs for easy insertion all around
* side flaps designed to fold backwards for getting even closer to the edge of the box
* no punch-out pieces (makes for easier waste management on Cameo cutter, and presumably on the die cut) -- all are flaps now
* 1cm square on design files for scaling double-check
* added 2 slit cards with easy-insert rounded bottom edge

I'm having some issues in Inkscape where the 1px stroke messes up the dimensions, even though it's on a 2mm grid. Will try for "hairline" or something, but it's a bummer. 

I have to attempt a print and test.

Not sure if DXFs can be uploaded for some reason? Will double check this too.
