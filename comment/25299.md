The Hanby test kit and others (yes, there are other portable units) should only be used for screening purposes, per EPA.  Nothing can be comparable to results from a certified lab. Hanby method also has some other limitations: per epa document https://clu-in.org/characterization/technologies/color.cfm
"The limitations of the Hanby Field Test Kit may include inaccurate comparison of color if the sample is dark in color. Further, concentrations may be underestimated for highly refined petroleum fuels (those that are lacking in aromatic compounds). Interpretation of results may be inaccurate because of interference from other petroleum fractions."
