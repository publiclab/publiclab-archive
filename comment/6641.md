Chris, some questions for you:

1) Is there a full resolution version of WarnerLkVis7075.jpg and WarnerLkVis7136.jpg somewhere for me to download?  It's not available at http://fastie.net/Bin/12WarnerVIS/.  That large patch of Trapa in the large circle at bottom center of 7075 is useful for grabbing Trapa color info, and I want to include NIR, but would like to avoid potential mismatch pitfalls in compressing/downsampling the NIR photo myself.

2) Are your NIR images as they came off the camera? (if so, did you set the NIR camera to record as B&W? Often it's possible to get red edge spectral info if you record NIR as color, depending on the characteristics of the Bayer array on the your camera)

Thanks!
