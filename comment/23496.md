 Hi [@Getty](/profile/Getty)! This looks pretty neat and the `stats` revamp is really amazing! I'd love to use this feature on the website as soon as possible! ðŸ˜ƒ 

Quoting myself from [@gautami_gg](/profile/gautami_gg)'s proposal,

> Just a question though, how does your model cater to the engaging needs of the newer members of PublicLab, both technical and non-technical?

Quoting myself from [@tonchuks](/profile/tonchuks)'s proposal,

> Can you share with us some code snippets (map integration, tests, etc.) and designs to have a more "in-depth" idea, so that we can visualize things better from your perspective? This will also make your proposal undoubtedly more convincing. These don't have to be much, just the least number of illustrations you believe that clearly communicate the message across. ðŸ˜ƒ

Thank you for sharing your proposal with us! This is fantastic! ðŸŽ‰
