I think linking to other files would be alright. In that sense, you are emulating a graph by issuing pointers as opposed to trying to copy-by-value important details like license into your copy of `contributors.json`. In the git comparison, you're enumerating previous commits or branches but not their contents.

There are some issues here, though. Here are two I came up with by thinking about what git does and how this fails to replicate it.

Cloning a repository maintains a snapshot of the entire history up to that point, but not necessarily after it. If `contributors.json` is changed upstream, that link doesn't mean the same thing it did when it was created.

Cloning a repository maintains a copy of all commits up to that point, including all user contributions. If the pointer to some upstream `contributor.json` becomes a broken URL, you lose that all historical context and previous contributors from that section of the tree.
