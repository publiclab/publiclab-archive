That's great to hear, [@tayreed](/profile/tayreed). 

I'm also asking around where I live to see if some folks are interested in putting together a guide on setting up these trail cameras, to try to get a lot more people doing so. I know some folks have had trouble with getting them into timelapse mode, so maybe we can make a video of that sequence to help.
