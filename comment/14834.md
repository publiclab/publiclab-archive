[@stoft](/profile/stoft) hey dave, I did remove the laser line from the plot, more so, when I subtracted the blank from the sample, part of the laser line was still there, the blank ( ethanol,) had a peak at 526nm and the laser line had a peak at 531nm? 

I also re-averaged the RGB channels of the signal to try and get rid of some more noise, was that a mistake? it did work and made the signal much easier to work with, especially with the new value of the bandpass number, but I see your point about the power point presentation parameters as a perfect senario, that was just the best example i've found so far, but your formula is makes more sense in this type of set up.

So I have two DVD gratings I can use, the 4.7g abd the 8.4g, right now I have the 8.4g at 277o lines, so I just inputted the values from your formula R = 1 X 0.12 X 2770 = 332.4
R = 532/332.4 = 1.60. I also noticed from the pwr point presentation that they were referring to a rotating diffraction grating, that certainly would be ideal, but I'm not sure how practical that would really be to construct. 

So what real steps can we take to side step some of these webcam limitations?
