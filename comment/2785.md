Well, not really, but we just took 25ml of each sample and scanned it with a xenon (halogen works too) source light. Bryan from Mystic said it's common to look at 600nm as the reference point for yeast quantity. Maybe he can comment further. But there remains work to be done -- like doing counts and correlating the spectral reading to the counts. Then perhaps yeast counts could be done every few days instead of multiple times per day.
