Hey [@chmooze](/profile/chmooze) 
Any progress on your project? I found this link from the OpenStreetMap community that another German city, Bonn, has made a CC0 dataset available containing the location, type and age of urban trees. The coordinate system does need a little conversion, but that is described here https://lists.openstreetmap.de/pipermail/bonn-rhein-sieg/2016-June/001928.html by Josef Schugt. http://opendata.bonn.de/dataset/baumstandorte
