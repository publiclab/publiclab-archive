I thought today's video was rather informative because it gave an in depth look into how nanoplastics enter the body and where they would reside. I also learned that nanoplastics plastic particles can increase cell count exponentially. Whereas polystyrene particles can enter the placenta and disperse into the liver, lungs, and brain.
