To add to [@liz](/profile/liz) 's answer, the "criteria pollutants" are lead, ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are the upper limits of ambient air concentrations for each of these pollutants based on risks to human and ecological health. More information about the NAAQS can be found here: [https://publiclab.org/wiki/frac-sand-legislation#National+Ambient+Air+Quality+Standards](https://publiclab.org/wiki/frac-sand-legislation#National+Ambient+Air+Quality+Standards).
