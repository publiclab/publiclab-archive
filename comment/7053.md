I pointed the camera at a very dark sky-blue sky, standing in the shade. It was a completely clear day, and I got the very orangey images as a result. 

I redid the white balance, this time using a standard blue bag outside in the early evening. The sun was still up and I took the photo in shade. My results are better, with blue, green, yellow, and red showing.

Would you mind taking a look to give me your opinion? I'm trying to get it accurate enough to show how it can be used for a demonstration. Thanks.
