Hi, ckmurt - i double checked by going through the build process from scratch again, and you're right -- 3-5" is too close. For whatever reason it is much more successful when focused approx 9" away from the lens. I'm not sure why this is, but try refocusing one more time (sorry for the trouble!) at 9" and tell me how it goes! See these images below:

Default focus:

Focused at 4" away (resulted in blurry spectrum as above in ckmurt's data):
