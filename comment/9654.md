I'm in Texas and am faced with an impending big fracking operation near my place. The TX Railroad commission, who manages the frackers, does post some chemical disclosures on their site. See 2 examples here on my fracktracking site: http://clafayette.com/fracktracking/  (at the end of the slideshow).
