Hi there, jbest!

Did you get usable images?  Sounds like you had a good flight.  Just a couple of notes:

1) I use electrical tape on the neck of the balloon to get a good seal and not let expensive He escape.  I thread the flying line under the tape.  I then use zip ties as a back up.

2) Nice use of traffic cones.  I have used orange speed squares that are exactly 12 inches each way.  http://www.sears.com/johnson-12-in-glo-orange-plastic-rafter-angle/p-00981569000P?sid=IDx01192011x000001&kpid=00981569000&kispla=00981569000P

3) Great thought about minimizing the amount of helium.  I usually just clip the camera on and see if it floats.  I try to use as little as possible too, especially since our prices are about $200 for a large tank here in NC.

Good luck!  Got any maps in the works?
