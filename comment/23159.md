Very cool! I think you could find some at [#mobius](/tag/mobius), or potentially just look through some old MapKnitter maps -- the Images tab should let you download full res versions of images... or if it doesn't, we can fix that!

Have you seen the fisheye distortion removal tool at [#lens-distortion](/tag/lens-distortion) as well?
