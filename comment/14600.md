Hi ggallant. To answer your questions: 1. Yes, the unit is intended for submerged operation. So far I have only had it submerged in beakers in the lab, and I'm not sure what sort of depths the design will hold up too. It would probably mostly depend on the quality of epoxy used.  2. I hope to do some field test in the near future, but so far I have only tested it overnight in the lab without any problems. With extended deployments you would have issues of bio-fouling and instrument drift. The stability of the instrument seems good over the course of a few days, but I would probably want to check for drift at least once a week if I had it deployed in the field. 3. Since the instrument is designed to be submerged, the water is circulated by the movement of whatever body of water the instrument is in. Although a flow cell could be easily made from some PVC pieces and a water pump. 4. The lab I'm in has some turbidity standards that were ordered from Fisher Scientific. The response is pretty linear, so a two point calibration seems sufficient. I used a 100 NTU standard and distilled water for my calibration.
