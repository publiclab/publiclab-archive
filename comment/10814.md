Finding a sensor that can do high-speed sampling in the range required is looking pretty expensive.  Thor Labs has [a series of amplified, cooled sensors](https://www.thorlabs.us/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=7182) in the right range-- for almost $4,000.

This [chart from Hamamatsu](http://www.hamamatsu.com/resources/pdf/ssd/infrared_techinfo_e.pdf) is helpful.  Indium Galium Arsenide (InGaAs), Lead Selenide (PbS) and Indium Arsenide (InAs) seem to be the high-sensitivity options.  All of those sensors seem to require cooling.
