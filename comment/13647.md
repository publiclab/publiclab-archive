Oh, sorry, i didn't look at whether it was a good calibration, just if the calibration itself seemed to save. Checking now... 

So, two things stand out to me:

1. I don't see any calibration operation in the Operations table. I'd think that means you copied an existing calibration in the Capture interface, but we recently deprecated that feature, so that doesn't seem likely. I'm not sure how your data got calibrated, actually -- any idea? Maybe somehow it got calibrated but the tags didn't save, but ... how'd the data get saved? Mysterious. See for example, this spectrum: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/71660 which has a `linearCalibration` operation (actually it has two, so you should probably delete one of them).
2. I see two `crossSection` operations. This is just not typical, so i'd remove them and just do a single crossSection. 

You know, I wonder if somehow the `range:` operation is causing it to think you have calibrated data. Could you maybe remove that for now? I'd work on a fork of your data but that seems to be erroring for some reason. :-(
