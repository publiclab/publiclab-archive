 Hiya [@liz](/profile/liz) and [@joyofsoy](/profile/joyofsoy),

Thank you both for sharing your vision! :) 

I think we would solve some of the issues by adding required fields (ideally with smart suggestions) when posting projects (as well as any other content). 

Once things are posted in a proper way (with info about location, time, tags), it will be much easier to display the right information in just a couple of clicks. So I could say: climate change -> filter by region -> filter by type (question, project, research note etc). 

And a navbar with tags on top - like joyofsoy suggested - could also be a way to go. We could add a dropdown menu with the way of participating. Donate and Store buttons could be somewhere in the sidebar, and the rest could be moved to the footer. 

My contract finishes today, but I'm confident that we will cross paths in the future :)

Keep well!

Eva
