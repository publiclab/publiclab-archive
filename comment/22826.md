This may not be a project to determine the quantities of the subject of your concern. The spectrometer in question is at an entry level and the analysis  of the sample in question is not at a level sufficient to give an adequate  level of confidance  to determine a valid diagnosis,.. from a legal viewpoint. The software used needs to be upgraded to reflect  the current level of image resolution available to the V3 spectrometer kit as well as to the other technologies. Perhaps others may wish to chime in with their viewpoints.
