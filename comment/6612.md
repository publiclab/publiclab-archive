Hi drabanus,
The time span between each spectra was less than 30 seconds and the LED light had been on for quiet some time before I began the tests.  I never tried to repeat the experiment with hours in between. The spectrometer I am using is the same as in my other post, "New spectrometer build and CFL lines", it is a box with black filt inside, the camera was never moved through out the testing, all I did was replaced the bottles. I had an idea to use a laser instead of a LED, then I would just get one curve and could measure the difference in clarity between the different water samples that way. Thanks.
