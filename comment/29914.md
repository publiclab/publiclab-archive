“Ghost Fishing,” catching deceased fish or fishing in the absence of fish.

Not too long ago I seen a video of a turtle having some fishing gear around its neck, nearly died before I person set it free. Lost or thrown away fishing gear have been killing marine life, around 640,000 is lost year. That is not the only problem, ghost gear creates problems for navigation when ships get their propellers caught in it, causes litter on beaches, is dangerous for birds and health and safety hazards for beachgoers. The question we should be asking is What can be done?
We can improve reporting ad recovery, stop illegal fishing, give economic incentives for prevention, Improve collection, and disposal and recycling schemes.
