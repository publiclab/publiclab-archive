Do you think it would work to just fix them right in the containers, if they were just cut big enough to not overlap, you could dry them in the containers too? That way, if there was a map of where each container was located on site, once the strips are fixed you could just either write with sharpie on them or just document them and mark the number/location in the documentation.
