Hi ned. Thank you for posting your work.

I was wondering, and I just want to check, for flying a small UAV with a single NIR camera, with the calibration method you propose:
 - The white balance has to be repeated every flight on the same target?
 - A photo of the same targets with known reflectance must be taken every flight, for computing the reflectnace vs. pixel value regression ?

If this is right, this adds some extra effort to the take-off procedure. Do you have any idea on how could this be reduced?

Thanks again for your posts :)
