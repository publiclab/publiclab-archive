Yes, resolution is affected by slit width; though much less than the intensity change which is related to the square area. I'd had some success in printing slit-image films and found small stepped-slits easier than graded-intensity slits so I opted for allowing a small effect on resolution. The slits were narrow - 8 to 20 mils, 3dB steps and I was including the gradient within the same film. (Yes, I prefer a couple of razor blades too...) Unfortunately, the camera images are much less well defined so I could not obtain a clear advantage. Then, when I measured the edge attenuation of just a regular slit and found a reasonably smooth curve, the option to use the existing hardware appeared more practical. There's now a lot of that hardware out there.....

Controlling the exposure is a difficulty -- I seem to recall it's all internal to the camera and no accessible. I was not able to find a way to do it with the little app that came with the camera. The camera has an active AGC which runs at full gain because most of the field is dark. So, high noise and sensitivity but at least the gain is constant.

There's been some chatter that camera's are non-linear but it's the post-processing algorithms that are that way. The sensors are linear and simple tests I've done suggest that the webcam, in it's present default mode, is relatively linear within the intensity range it is being used. My point is that we could go a long way in improving the basic capture process by 1) grab the full image, 2) auto-detect the full spectral band, 3) auto correct for band curvature, 4) run HDR on the band (where some clipping is good) and lastly, 5) auto-cal CFL spectra.
