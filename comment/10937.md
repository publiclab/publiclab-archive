Greg, that’s very exciting progress. Your new [summary](http://blog.photosynq.org/what-you-can-measure-with-your-multispeq/) of all the measurements that can be taken with a MultispeQ is excellent. It’s the best description yet of the MultispeQ’s capabilities.

One of the statements there relates to a discussion Robert started at the Public Lab Barnraising in Louisiana. You say:

 “…here’s a cool infra-red filtered image showing fluorescing trees and grass – notice that the brightest objects (most emitted infra-red) are the leaves!”

Robert was also saying that “most” of the glow of foliage in the near infrared (the Wood Effect) was due to fluorescence. This was new to me, and I have not been able to confirm it. In the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_photography) where the image you cite is used, it says:

“… the "Wood Effect," an effect mainly caused by foliage (such as tree leaves and grass) strongly reflecting in the same way visible light is reflected from snow.[1] There is a small contribution from chlorophyll fluorescence, but this is marginal and is not the real cause of the brightness seen in infrared photographs.”

Robert was going to look into this, but I thought I would nudge you guys a little. Below is the photo you refer to. My understanding is that maybe one or two percent of the NIR radiating from sun lit foliage is due to fluorescence and the rest is just reflection. Lots of NIR is also transmitted through thin leaves.
