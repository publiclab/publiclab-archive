Here are two pieces of evidence that are consistent with the failed relay hypothesis.
1) When I first got the timer working (with nothing connected to the output block) I noticed that the entire device moved every time the relay clicked. It just skittered a fraction of a mm at each interval.  It does not do that anymore, and I cannot feel anything when I touch the relay as the timer is running, suggesting that the physical switch is not moving.  I can still hear a clicking, but it is very faint (too faint for my recording equipment).

2) My first test of the output circuit was with two SD1000 cameras.  I think both cameras triggered for the first few cycles of the timer.  Then they never did again, so I started testing with a test lamp which produced the results above.

So the output circuit worked originally, and might have stopped working less than a minute into my first test.  That could be because the power from the A23 battery dropped too low, or because the relay failed, or because some other component of the timer failed.

I can pick up another relay at Radio Shack for a few bucks (and get more soldering practice).

Good idea?
