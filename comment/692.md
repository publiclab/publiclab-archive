Excellent air photos!  I agree that oblique shots can be really informative.  The ISSUU presentation is fantastic.  I finally understand what Gowanus is all about.

We are working on some tips for taking mapping photos with the PLOTS IR camera tool, but some of the information applies more generally. One way to keep the shutter speed high is to use shutter speed priority set to 1/800 second if possible. If the camera does not have that feature, CHDK adds it to Canon Powershots.  It is described here:

To eliminate burned out highlights on sunny days, most cameras have an exposure compensation setting.  Setting that to -2/3 is common for aerial photos on sunny days. It just instructs the camera to figure out the exposure, then reduce it by 2/3 stop.  More here:

I like the photo of you paddling up to rescue the kite.
