The lack of differentiation really surprised me. The fact that hornworms fed a leaf-free diet turn blue is consistent with the idea that ÃŸ-carotene in the skin is mimicking the Infragram signature of leaves. Carotenoid pigments look orange because they [absorb blue but not red](http://publiclab.org/wiki/ndvi-plots-ir-kit). Without the carotenoids, hornworm skin reflects more blue. Although my hornworms were apparently absorbing blue, like leaves, they should not be absorbing so much red (chlorophyll in leaves absorbs both blue and red) . So I hypothesize that a two camera infrared system that uses red light instead of blue for the visible band will distinguish hornworms from foliage. If someone would like to fund this research project, I will send you my PayPal info.
