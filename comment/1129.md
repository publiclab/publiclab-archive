cool... i wonder if people will actually refine it.

The PVC one is really working well; i made it point upwards rather than sideways, and could def. see a foldable one working. Also putting a tube of black paper in as a liner helped keep light leakage/reflection down.

I'm very tempted to try to make one which can be laser cut from either thick black cardstock or a foldable rigid black plastic sheet.
