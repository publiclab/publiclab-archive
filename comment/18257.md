I just got a lego spectrophotomer "kit"  a bag of some lego pieces, a slit, and a CD.  Directions are online I guess and the buyer must supply the raspberry pi I assume.  
   $ 50 dollars for the above seems a little steep (actual cost $ 2 - 3?) and mailing cost of ~ $7 hard to believe for such a light package.  
   Am I missing something here?
