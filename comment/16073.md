Hi, [@mathew](/profile/mathew) and [@SimonPyle](/profile/SimonPyle) -

Terrific work!
After seeing the demonstration mathew  gave at the barnraising in November '16, and then looking at Cambridge's design, a question comes to mind.
The Cambridge site says they use a white LED from below to illuminate the object you're viewing.
Would a laser LED, rather than white light, give better image quality and get rid of chromatic aberration? As you're viewing it on a screen rather than peering through a lens, then, no worries about retinal damage. It might make visualizing the particles easier.
If you're interested in the refractive properties of silica, this paper is useful:
