My background is mostly industrial- specifically pharmaceutical.  So much of the testing was guided by something like The USP. The instruments were usually moderately expensive ( ph meter about $2k usually using a ross electrode in the $500 range).  Turbidity, conductivity, total organic carbon (toc), uv/vis, were routine tests.  Other more expensive tests were done on extracts less often.

As for storm sewer testing, we pulled those with an isco sampler.  P h was tested routinely, before preserving the sample and sending it to a certified lab.  We would do some other tests , in house, since the the lab wasn't certified ( for info only).  Some were wet chemical like oil and grease.  Some were biological. Occasionally we would have a problem that would require extra testing with something like a gc/ms. 
Which was an instrument we were lucky enough to have, probably because of the pharmaceutical business we were in.
