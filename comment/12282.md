Standard for an extra carriage return in Markdown is [leaving a single blank line between two blocks of content](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#paragraphs) - that may more sense, or be easier than the "double spaces > linebreak" trick. [Discussion here](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/26011/should-the-markdown-renderer-treat-a-single-line-break-as-br)

This is very cool; is it possible to have the targets arranged in a standard way as squares around a central QR code? Or even two QR codes separated by a series of squares? That would let us eventually automate the identification of the targets in the image, so if we can agree on a standard, that'd be great.
