My understanding -- based on very limited reading! -- is that remote sensing solutions are mostly geared toward oil sheens on water and won't be particularly helpful for detecting adjacent spills on land.  You can test soil vapors using a PID detector but that requires you to have a sample and to know where to look.  

Here is an article describing that process: **[Real time monitoring of soil contamination with diesel fuel using photoionization detectors](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25765299.2019.1670464)**. Victor Bocos-Bintintan, Ileana Andreea Ratiu & Hossam Al-Suod (2019)

This is "real-time" -- you can test the vapors yourself if you have the detector vs. taking a sample and sending it away -- but you still need to be able to go out and collect the sample, which might be hard in this case.
