On the raspberry pi camera there is no real focus, so you either unscrew the lens assembly (google macro lens / macro photography and raspberry pi camera) or you buy a pi camera with a different lens mount which allows for better focus control. I've discontinued the project so you won't see any finished product I'm afraid. Due to good detective work I don't need the spectrometer to characterize the raspberry pi sensor no longer.
