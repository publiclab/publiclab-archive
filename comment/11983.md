Thanks [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie). 

I have processed some RGB images with fiji using the NDVI variogram you used for this one, getting good results. However I never could process filtered images, for this reason I want to know the method you have used for make the corrections on this image, and the tool you used for get NDVI map on fiji (I have inastalled the lut and the plugin mentioned in another publicLab forums)

Thanks for your help,
