I wonder if there are ways besides simultaneous editing to achieve healthy wiki growth -- that is, unlike Google Docs, wikis were not designed (on our site or in general) for simultaneous collaboration. Not that there aren't advantages to simultaneous editing -- such as the good shared energy of doing something with a group of other people -- but are there also ways we can get better at encouraging periodic iterative improvement, which is what wiki technology was developed for?

Perhaps we could also think about:

* the "edit here" feature seen on the common water contaminants page 
* "resolvable" comments like in Google Docs that allow people to comment and critique inline in the margins
