the [#3](/n/3) stopper just barely fits under a bottle cap. I'd mentioned trying vulcanized rubber stoppers and that they were too hard-- the problem was pushing the stopper in far enough for the cap's threads to hold. 

Grease might help. With the softer natural rubber, its easy to push it in far enough for the threads to take a bit, and screwing the cap down firmly sets it in place.  turning the cap gets difficult because of the stickiness of the rubber, and some grease may let the cap turn smoothly. If the stopper is too greased up I'd worry it would be susceptible to being pushed into the bottle. 

Now, all the tests I did involved fitting a tube into the stopper's hole.  The elasticity of the stopper will change if its pure caulk in the middle. We'll see how that works.  If the caulk bonds well to both the wires and the stopper (and i expect it could) I think the idea has some real traction.  if we're having bonding trouble, putting something rigid back in for the caulk to hold on to ought to work.
