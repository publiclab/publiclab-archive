Hi [@Akinkunmi02](/profile/Akinkunmi02) thanks for your proposal - i'm glad to see you're digging into the complexities of this cross-application role system. The hourly polling of status sounds great, however I have a suggestion -- ActiveJob depends on a queueing backend, which I don't believe we currently have installed in MapKnitter.org. So I wonder if we could do a lighter weight approach where we record a timestamp for the last time we checked a given user status, and as part of the "current_user" check (which is where we see if they are logged in, and is called regularly), we see if that timestamp is more than 1 hour old. If it is, we update the status and, if necessary, ban them. This could avoid increasing back-end system complexity, and isn't so much logic to manage. What do you think?
