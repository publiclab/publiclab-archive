This is so fun!.  I've been starting to reproduce the Matlab code in a Jupyter notebook, in order to understand the algorithm ... it's still a mess, but here is is in case it's interesting: https://github.com/dwblair/fsk-fec/blob/master/fsk_test.ipynb

My interest at this point is in modifying both SoftModem and WebJack to implement Forward Error Correction.  The simplest form being:  send every bit 3 times from the Arduino side, and then do a 'majority vote' on the WebJack side.  Then, could move onto more sophisticated codes ... but that'd be a really cool start, and might be enough to reduce error rates significantly ...

[@rmeister](/profile/rmeister), does that sound like a plausible modification?  Or am I just  to be  simple because I have no idea what I'm doing yet?  :)
