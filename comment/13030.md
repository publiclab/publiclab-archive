Thanks [@danbeavers](/profile/danbeavers)!  The PDF you just linked to seems empty -- if you get a chance, could you link to a URL with the part?  

I have share your feeling about the "socket" designs -- very easy to prototype, as with the Arduino UNO.  

### Power

What about this as a simple solution:  


[![switch.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/190/medium/switch.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/190/original/switch.jpg)

I.e. the switch decides whether we are connected to USB or Battery.  It both serves as an "on/off" switch when only on battery (useful so that, with only a battery connected, you can switch off the device when not deployed), and could serve as a "reset" button of sorts when connected to USB and not connected to battery (when you're programming and run into those bugs that really make you wish you could easily just reset the board).  

Seem like a good idea, or am I missing something?
