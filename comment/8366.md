Thanks Jack! Great to hear re: your surface mount experience.  I'm looking forward to trying it out myself.  I haven't ordered a stencil -- but that'd definitely be the way to go if the design works out ... there are all sorts of things I may have done wrong at this point :) so I might need to iterate a few times before a stencil is worth it?  But maybe it'd actually help assembly so much that it would, in fact, be worth it from the beginning? 

Jeff -- yep, it's a 32u4, which has built-in USB!  We could certainly add the PCB-USB plugin thingy design, for sure -- but, actually, the experience that folks in the MCHCK have had using such a design with the MCHCK (which has had a similar pcb design) is that a regular USB + cable is a less finicky, more stable (not as cool) option.  The MCHCK project is probably switching over to the standard approach, too (and that's what we're using on the Riflfle).  But not much cost to modifying the design if we wanna give it a shot!
