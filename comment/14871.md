Oh yeah -- actually that's an open source method too, by Joshua Pearce's lab; you can find some of the parts here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:958405/

[@stoft](/profile/stoft) and/or [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke), i'm curious about your input on this -- does the beer lambert law hold for opacity of a reagent? I guess it depends on if the reagent color change is linearly related to the concentration of the target compound (nitrate).

If it does, this is another reason to push our [#cuvette-frame](/tag/cuvette-frame) design forward, as we'd likely be able to do a similar photometric analysis of the reagent color change using either a fixed-exposure camera or two or more standard control samples at known nitrate concentrations.
