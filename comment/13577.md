Hi Chris,

Yes ,they are the castor beans.

I converted previously discussed image into NDVI image using infragram 's web server utilities. 

[![download.png](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/014/242/medium/download.png)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/014/242/original/download.png)

using infragram web server converted images.

Using fiji software converted NDVI.

My query related NDVI image is below,

Which programme is more reliable for NDVI image conversion from fiji,python script and infargrame's web server ?
