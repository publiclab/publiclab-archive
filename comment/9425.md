Hi Don,  I see no reason why graphite would not work for measuring conductivity.  In fact, I think it would work better than most metals since it does not tend to support production of H2 or O2 as well.  I have bought mine from http://www.graphitestore.com/ both directly and through Amazon.com.  They sell all kinds of carbon products in sizes up to 9 inch diameter by 6 feet. 
Hope that helps.
Best,
Jack
