Looks like there is an issue with reply by email, or possibly the list => email system, but Alan Marchiori responded on the `plots-waterquality` list with:

> See appendix 2 of this doc for creating the turbidity standards with Formazin: https://www.hach.com/asset-get.download-en.jsa?id=7639984480.

> With that said, those turbidity sensors aren't very accurate or precise. More info here https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/14/3039.

> If you get good results, please report back.
