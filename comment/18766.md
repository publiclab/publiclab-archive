Hello [@mridulnagpal](/profile/mridulnagpal),

[@warren](/profile/warren) told me to coordinate with you, regarding the geographic APIs we are discussing in this proposal, for a team up. I also proposed to make a v2 API in my proposal. So I think it would be great if in v2 we can also add your project, and for that we need to work together, which will be fun.

Whenever you are ready, let's begin this thing.
You can visit to my proposal here: https://publiclab.org/notes/Raounak/02-21-2018/gsoc-proposal-v2-api-development

Thanks
