Winds were light, but with Delta kite, was able to fly iPhone/CHDK triggering A490 (IR) and A495 (visible) in jpeg format. This was with original macro. Processed and other images are at: https://www.flickr.com/photos/coylepdc/sets/72157630108709086/

Got updated macro, it registered all pairs. Processed images are at:
