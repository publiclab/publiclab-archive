 I've been experimenting with the Input Capture Unit on our pro mini's 329p processor, and with it you can  [make ‘High-Resolution’ Sensor Readings with DIGITAL I/O pins](https://thecavepearlproject.org/2019/03/25/using-arduinos-input-capture-unit-for-high-resolution-sensor-readings/)

I've been using this to read garden-variety Thermistors, and this new method easily outperforms the 16bit oversampling we've been using up till now.  Works with any resistive sensor, and a similar approach should work with ANY processor provided they have schmitt triggers on their digital IO pins.
