Hi [@MaggPi](/profile/MaggPi)! 
Actually the easiest way to reach the PublicLab chatroom is thru https://chat.publiclab.org/ .
While we support bridges to other chat networks, our "home" chatroom is hosted by matrix.org and reachable with Riot https://about.riot.im/ - a libre messaging system.
I will be helping with co-mentoring - also I am PublicLab.Org's sysadmin. My strengths are systems programming, web, and Python.
I hope you will have a great summer project! Please ping us if you feel stuck at any time. Any community channel is good!
