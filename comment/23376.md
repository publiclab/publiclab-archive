 Thanks for this design work, it's really cool to see!!! 

I'm curious if you're interested in taking a look at our search pages, both the search page itself like https://publiclab.org/search and also results pages like https://publiclab.org/search/balloon-mapping -- they could use some design work! Maybe riffing on some of the new styles in the [#ui](/tag/ui) postings, using Bootstrap-like styles, you know?

Thanks a ton for this, it's very cool to see!
