Goodmorning everyone.
This is a first test of NDVI dimensional mapping from aerial vehicles (UAVs ) . I took only a small portion of the map , not load gigantic images . In blue , a small stream of water and a dirt road ( dirt road for agricultural vehicles ) . The rest ( green , yellow , red ) are all active plant mass .
If the weather will allow me , in the coming days , I will prepare a new and better aerial mapping NDVI .
