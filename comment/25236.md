Hi!
Pi Builder itself is the recipe for building the customized Operating System image that we distribute, a version of which bundles the [RPi-Cam-Web-Interface](https://elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface).

You may be running into the hardware limits of the Pi Zero W. My guess is that the RAM may be insufficient. Check available RAM from the command line with the command `free` or `top`.

Here's a couple of things that you could try (please tell us if either helped!).

1) You could login to the Pi and edit the file `/boot/config.txt`: It says "gpu_mem=128" but I believe you could tweak this to say "gpu_mem=64" or even "gpu_mem=16" might work. You need to reboot the Pi after editing the file. You could edit the file on the microSD card directly too.

2) To handle a brief memory spike you might add some Swap Memory (Virtual Memory). Log into your Pi and as super user (`su`):
   - Create a new swapfile:
           $ sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile
(alternatively if fallocate isn't installed:)
           $ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1048576

Note: This will create 1GB file on the microSD card to be used as virtual RAM memory.

   - Change permissions: `$ sudo chmod 600 /swapfile`
   - Activate: `$ sudo swapon /swapfile`
   - Check available memory with `free`. Test if high res works!
   - If so make change permanent, add the following to `/etc/fstab`: `/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0`

Hope it goes well!
