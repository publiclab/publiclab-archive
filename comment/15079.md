Tony's deployment just came back from the roof, I thought i'd share some details.  The weatherproofing appears to have held.

The external battery is drained, but I'm not sure if it re-charged the Mobius. The mobius was set for 5 minute intervals, and ran for .  The camera ran for 11 days.  Previously Tony had stated the camera could run for approximately 10 days on its internal battery.  Given that the external battery is supposed to be 10,000mAh and the internal battery is 820mAh, I'd say that the external battery
had a negligible effect.
