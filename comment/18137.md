I'm specifically looking at tracking carbohydrate metabolism in bacteria. Early on I'll just be using phenol red which is a clear indicator when acidity changes - but the changes in color are subtle enough that I wanted to actually see a clear response from the phenol red crystal and hopefully detect other types of by-products. 

I'm using a halogen for the light source and while I have a number of leds at specific nm ranges I almost think the CFL is good enough.
