> The general rule of thumb I have used in the past is that the hight of your camera will be about the width of the photo it will take. Not sure where I heard it from, and maybe it could use some calculations and rethinking, but that's generally what I've thought. Also, the closer you are, the higher resolution they will be, but the higher you go, the less likely you'll have to stitch too many photos together and you can get your site in 1-2 photos!
