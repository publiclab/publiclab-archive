I just did everything again, same problem... clean instalation of fiji and download from github....
and i just realize that there are 2 installation methods,,, coping the .jar file to the directory...
or drag and drop the jar to the fiji gui... this second one worked just fine!!
Now i got it working! :)

I will start processing some images and upload them so we can see the results! Thank you guys!!! 

Edit > Im uploading 5 examples to my dropbox, but its taking a long time,,, ( slow internet... ) https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zvtyke3wpdtw4pt/7Yt9_qYcGW/uav

Chris I use all the same settings that you used and it made a huge change on the aligment,,, i also try adding some extra time when i create the list, on the max difference between offset... in my case its 0 because the cameras were sync,,, but if i leave 0 sometimes the pictures are not align,,, i will keep experimenting with this.

I have another question,,, i have 2 go pro hero 2, one with a broken lens, i will be getting the spare part maybe next month,,, this procedure can be done with cmos cameras?  i found this,,, seems to be working... http://publiclab.org/notes/gonzoearth/07-02-2013/multispectral-gopro-at-cloverleaf-farm

and last question,,, is my dual camera set up the best thing to do ? because i see lots of project with 1 camera setup an similar results ...
