Love it! Maybe we should offer these parts in the store for early experimenters? Just the stopper and some sealant? 2.8oz tubes are for <$4 on amazon: http://www.amazon.com/00684-Corning-Silicone-Sealant-2-8-Ounce/dp/B000AP6CGQ/

[@tonyc](/profile/tonyc), what do you think? If we put out on the lists as a special maybe we could gauge interest?
