Yes Sunspot is running on top of solr search engine. And we have to install [solr](https://rubygems.org/gems/sunspot_solr) gem. But when we discuss with compared to ransack, very basic issue with ransack is, it recommends ruby version 2.2+ according to their [documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ransack/1.7.0). Sunspot support for all the ruby versions and rails 3+ versions.

Since Publiclab is text based (research notes and wiki pages) system and be supportive to Q&A tool 
which is going to implement in near future, we can use advanced text searching facilities provide by sunspot. And by using one text field (like the search box in publiclab.org) we can query easily from sunspot. For the nested (or recursive) searchings can be fulfilled using its [Faceting](https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot#faceting) feature. 

From [Ransack_demo](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack_demo) we can have good idea about how ransack works. It has quick implementation for the sorting. But I think its segmented searching fields and detailed categorization may not be suitable with PublicLab. As Jeff mention ransack has no external dependancy requirement. But as I guess after the installing phase, we can have more advantage from sunspot in our publiclab scenario.
