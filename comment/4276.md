Thanks Mathew, I'll give it a try. I had such good results with previous Delta without tails, I'd prefer not to have to use them. However, with the Sutton FF 16, I don't even try to fly without fuzzy tail.

I forget how, but I stumbled into a nice surprise on http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/hiddenecologies/ when saw a nice image of your Tyvek Delta in the January 13th, 2012  post, A trip to the Mojave Desert.
