Oops, i sent this before finishing it up! Too many tabs open, i guess, got distracted. [@ccpandhare](/profile/ccpandhare), can you post a checklist as outlined above a bit? I see you've done plenty of planning, I'd just like to see the final URL where it's all organized in a checklist on GH. Much appreciated!
