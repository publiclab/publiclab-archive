The Snowy Egret is the only south Louisiana wader that is constrained by both water depth and prey density. Maybe water depth could be inferred from high altitude photos given time of day and tides or other factor? How is prey density measured? The Great Egret and Great Blue Heron, which apparently do not share the Snowy Egret's feeding constraints, seem more abundant to me these days but that's just an observation.

Having this sort of info might help build a simple decision tree, a first step in automated counting.
