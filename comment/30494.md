The alligator was the biggest reptile native to America. Since the introduction of Burmese Pythons, their population has exploded. It has been found that they prefer swampy lowlands, making Florida have the perfect conditions. Infact, people have compared the temperature of their origin, and many of the southern states have the perfect conditions. New Delhi, India, which is the Burmese Phyton’s homeland, has an average temperature of 14.1° C. In Orlando, Florida, the average temperature is 15.9° C. It is a danger for them to spread in the south because they make a meal out of alligators. They grow many feet long, longer than humans can be tall, which is concerning because they might come for us too. Florida has beautiful features with amazing animals in its habitats, and they are under a threat now. In 2012, native racoon and bobcat populations dropped by 85-99%. If the Burmese Python keeps affecting the food chain, the balance will become corrupt and affect us too.
