Great question Chris - indeed, built up areas are often spectrally very high diversity as one would expect given the myriad of surfaces we use.  If I want to limit a Diversidad analysis to wild lands I mask out the urban or developed areas.  But typically, I run everything as the results are always interesting to me.  In some cases, biologically speaking, developed environments can have high diversity too though there are usually a lot of invasive species that occupy built environments.

Thanks!
