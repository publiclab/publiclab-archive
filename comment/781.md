To share, feel free to upload the .zip, but you're right, once that's done we could try to unpack it a bit and create some images and wiki pages from it. How about uploading first and we can discuss and see how to adapt it for web presentation. The uploading will effectively release it under the CERN OHL. (although of course Tommaso has already done so)
