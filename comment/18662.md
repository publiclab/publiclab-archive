This is so great. I don't even have one in front of me, and I can follow along. Nice work! 

if you're switching out the objectives, do you have thoughts on how to keep dust off the sensor? 

Great questions on the "why the shorter tube" section, wondering if [@warren](/profile/warren) has ideas on pulling those out for some sort of top level design challenge questions?
