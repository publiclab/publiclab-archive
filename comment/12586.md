"An online tool used to help identify which California communities are hit hardest by environmental hazards reveals significant disparities by race, according to an analysis by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA)."

"[Editor's note: New Jersey has developed an environmental justice screening tool similar to the California screening tool described in this news story.  The difference is that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has kept its screening tool under wraps, never releasing it for its intended purpose, which is to identify overburdened communities.]"
