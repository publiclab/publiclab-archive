This looks great! I will try this at my next mapping on Wednesday - I used the plastic bottle rig in the mapping handbook so would be good to experiment with different rigs!! I'll get the group to think of ways we can combat spinning/incorporate a bottle and try some things out together. Will let you know how it goes!
