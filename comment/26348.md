Yup, that black stuff is a really low-temp adhesive-- like hot glue. It should snap off when you twist the lens, but if it's too difficult you can cut it with an exacto (just be careful not to poke yourself in the process).. you should be able to lift off enough of it to make turning easier. If you're still having trouble try using pliers to get a little extra leverage.
