Replacing the camera's IR block filter with exposed, developed, color print film allows only near infrared light to be captured. These IR photos are not Infragram photos and cannot be transformed into NDVI or false color IR images for analyzing plant health. To make an Infragram camera, the IR block filter can be replaced with a red filter like Wratten 25A or Rosco [#19](/n/19). Producing meaningful NDVI images directly from Infragram photos requires that the camera has a custom white balance feature. Most web cams and cell phone cameras probably do not have this feature.
