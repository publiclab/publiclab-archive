Andy Baker Beautiful! This Saturday 6/21 we built the sand bag breakwater in the mid upper left, just below the bridge. 
These pictures really capture the waves of material washing in from the dredging contractor's surreptitious dumping under the bridge. I think we are going to have to get another day with a bobcat to move around some of the excess that's impacting the wetland.

Marilyn Eyer So cool to see our breakwater at work so quickly. Thanks Scott!
