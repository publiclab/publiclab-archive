Hi [@nwokichaamarachi](/profile/nwokichaamarachi) , it would be good if you could include more on the approach you plan to take.... pseudo code, data flow, mockups screenshots of any existing bugs you have seen or even libraries/tools you will use would help. 
Also on the timeline you maybe you could bold the phases headings or make them  them h3 or h4 headers. Is it just me or does using italics makes it seems as if they are not important parts of the timeline?   
Thanks for posting
