This is a so beautiful personal experience. 
Personal experience is same like shuttering for building[https://cementconcrete.org/concrete/formwork-shuttering-for-concrete/2259/], it enables us to handle the tough time in our life. Our life is full of disaster so, we have to take good experiences in our life.
