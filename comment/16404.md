Hi, Mayank - thanks for your proposal! A few questions, but I'm happy to help you think through them.

I'd like to think about how the tagging interface for the Rich Editor (could you include a screenshot?) could be adapted, but note that while on a Node page, we see "already created" tags, while on the editor, it's more like "yet to be created" tags, in a form. Would the Rich Editor style tagging (which uses an existing library, check it out -- it isn't custom code we wrote, so could you link to that library here?) just replace the input form below the tag listing?

Also, I would love to see some ideas for how the advanced tagging menu could work. Would it be an expanding area, or a modal window, or what? Maybe you could sketch out some options in wireframes, and if you want to know the kinds of UI elements we have available, please check out https://getbootstrap.com/

Finally, if you could start thinking about the stages of work, and how you'd break up these tasks into a checklist where you could submit completed work each week, that would be great. You'll end up with somewhere around 12-15 weeks, isn't that right?

Thank you!
