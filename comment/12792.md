This is very interesting.  May I suggest checking out the guide published by NIST which has some guidelines for performing image analysis by SEM including the number of particles to count to ensure the data is statistically valid.  You can find it [HERE](http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=850451).  It is called NIST Special Publication 960-1.  You can even order a hardcopy for free.
