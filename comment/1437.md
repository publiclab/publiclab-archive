That helps, and explains a problem I was seeing with a laser;  I could easily see a very bright spectrum when observing the image on my computer, but was not seeing a reliable spectrum on spectralworkbench.  I was hand holding the laser and the spectrum would come and go in spectralworkbench, and now I figure that was because my aim of the laser was moving around.

  This also brings up a point: is it best to sample one row of pixels or a range?  The advantage to a single row that I can see is that it would compensate for the spectrum not being perfectly aligned to the camera detector axis, while using a few rows of pixels might reduce resolution while perhaps increasing sensitivity for low intensity objects.

I also notice that bright areas on the spectrum as seen visually may be offset from the peak of the curve drawn by the software.  Do others observe this? and do you know the explanation?
