One way to get a rough idea of whether a foam is naturally-occurring or potential pollution is to poke it with a stick (much like the “[stick test](https://publiclab.org/questions/stevie/01-24-2020/how-can-you-tell-if-a-sheen-on-water-is-bacterial-or-petroleum-oil)” for surface water sheens): “Poke foam with a stick and see if it breaks apart. If so, it’s probably natural!” (From this [guide to spotting pollution](https://www.re-sources.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Water-Reporter-manual-final-2019-08-26-copy.pdf) from Re-Sources for Sustainable Communities in Bellingham, WA).
