Thank you [@warren](/profile/warren) for the feedback and suggestions.

As you've noticed, design mockups for all the suggestions are missing as they're still in progress.
I shall update the proposal with them as soon as I'm done with them.

But I'd like to have the time-point vs time-range concept clarifed.
If we select a time-range, what images should we fetch?
All images that were uploaded or updated in that time range?

My intention with time-point was, it would fetch all images that existed on the map at that point of time. Along with the correct version of the image that existed at that point of time. If the images were updated at a later time, it would be a way to see all the images as they were in that past point.
