I think this frac sand mine in western Wisconsin want quarry the rocks for the [manufacture of cement](https://cementconcrete.org/cement-concrete-applications/manufacturing-of-cement/2192/), because as demand of the cement for [concrete](https://cementconcrete.org/concrete/how-concrete-is-made/1269/) construction is growing day-by-day.
