A pair of doubts:
In the equation in the image, it should say (IR-B)/(IR+B) (like in the video) instead of (IR-R)/(IR+R), Shouldn't it? 
Is the (IR-R)/(IR+R) equation the which one employed to get the NDVI with the RGB photos made by satellites? (the photos we get with Publiclab's Infrared filter are NBG). 
Thanks!
