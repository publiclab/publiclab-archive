This is great information. In the first GIF, the second largest circle, near the top, has a nice large patch of pure Trapa that appears to be similar to the bigger patch you used for training. I guess it's a bad sign that the upper patch was not flagged very well. In the second GIF, it looks like a lot of the white specks in the chromaticity plus luminance image are the flowers of white pond lily. I guess that's a good sign. 

Except for the big pure Trapa patches, when I drew all of those circles my brain had to focus on the repeating pattern of leaves of Trapa which are smaller than the leaves of other plants there. Maybe an algorithm is going to have to do the same thing.

Thanks for explaining this approach. This is really good progress.
