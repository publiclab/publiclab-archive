Hallo! 

I haven't had great luck with Digikey shopping carts sticking around, so it might be better to put direct links to parts in e.g. a wiki ...

Re: burning out the timer, haven't had that happen myself (I don't think?) but I guess you'd just want to be careful to stay within the voltage limits of the 555.  There might also be ways of applying a reverse voltage to the wrong pins which could make the 555 decide to curl up and die.  

E.g., for [this version](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/TLC555CP/296-1857-5-ND/277502), looks like the voltage inputs need to be between 2V and 15V.
