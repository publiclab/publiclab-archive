Sure. I won't say I have the best way to do it but that works for me for many different lenses.

Take a picture of that screen : http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0zx-4pM8HnA/TSltkqjXscI/AAAAAAAAAI0/45MJoCS5-f8/s1600/OpenCV_Chessboard.png

Go to Gimp, open that picture, use filter=>distortion=>lens distortion, and play with settings until you have the picture square

For batch treatment, go to Bimp, click on the Add button, open the "open other bimp procedure", then choose plug-in-lens-distortion and use the same parameters as for gimp, then select directory or files, then Apply

My gimp is in French so options may not have the exact same wording but you should get the idea. Let me know if that works for you too.
