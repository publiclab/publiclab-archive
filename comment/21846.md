The ICE auto alignment and  fill in features are impressive and super cool.  Still, I like MapKnitter since it lets you zoom in/out.  I think that's really important since  microscope lenses force you to pick between resolution or field of view.   Once you make the mosaic you  can have both by scrolling thru the image.   Of course, you could probably do the same thing with an ICE Image by adding a separate viewer.

Right now, I am trying to compare different stitching programs to see how they work.  My list so far is MapKnitter, ICE, ImageJ, Adobe photomerge and  opencv stitcher.    If you know of any  reviews that compare performance  of different stitching programs I would be interested.  Thanks again for your help.    


Also added some more frames to the initial mapKnitter post so  you can see more of the bee  leg.
