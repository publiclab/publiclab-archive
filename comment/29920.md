In this area of Ohio many municipalities use water wells to serve the local cities.  As the demand for the municipal water increases, private wells dry up.  Meaning new wells need to be drilled ( an expensive task), usually much deeper than the original.  Often, the deeper water will be of worse quality, requiring water treatment.  And since the wells are deeper, the pumps are more expensive.  This ballet could get more complicated with the cyanobacteria(a toxic bacteria ), often found in many water sources. This could put additional immediate demands on groundwater.
