Very interesting line of inquiry. I've always been a bit confused about the role of the filter material itself in focus -- my assumption has been that the focus algorithm may be "confused" by monochromatic images; i.e. it may use a combination of channels to calculate focus, and have trouble focusing if one or more of those channels has very little light. 

But I hear people talking about filters having physical optical effects, and you mention:

> the glass filter should preserve the optics of the original IR block filter

If the filters are not curved at all, how can this be? They also don't change the geometry of the existing lens/sensor arrangement; and since it's rubber-gasketed in place, I had guessed that the precision of its placement was not very important. 

Chromatic aberration seems like a reasonable possibility though -- especially with infrablue, where the span of wavelengths (blue vs. IR) is quite wide. With Ned getting good red-filter infragrams, the two channels would be much closer in wavelength, and maybe the lower chromatic difference would make for better overall focus. But even in infrablue images, we should be able to see some difference in focus between the blue and IR channels, unless the focus algorithm just focuses quite evenly halfway between the two channels, in which case they'd be equally blurry.
