Hi [@planet](/profile/planet), it's always fun to hear this kind of feedback.
Please note that I only used the desktop spectrometer as a "reference design", you can use it as is while filming many frames, or a video you will later need to split to images.
If you find that you want to have a wider FOV then rebuilds the enclosure such that you could image the full width of the slit. If you want images with better optical quality and without the curviness which is caused by the DVD material look for a grating with the same number of grooves, if you get a slightly higher or lower lines/mm you may need to adjust the angle between the slit and the camera.
It is most definitely possible to show images from outside the visible range, I didn't put is an option in my SW, but you could either change it to suite you, or use the generated RGB image and post process the unwanted color channels out.

Please write back if you have questions, or if you were able to do anything cool with it.
