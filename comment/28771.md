A [toxic tort](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/toxic-torts-overview-32204.html) is a legal claim for harm caused by exposure to a dangerous substance â€”such as a pharmaceutical drug, pesticide, or chemical.
Sometimes substances which are thought to be safe turn out to be otherwise (asbestos is one example). Other times, substances known to be dangerous accidentally leak into the air or groundwater.
These claims are sometimes brought on behalf of a group of people, in what is called a class action lawsuit, or as consolidated lawsuits known as multi-district litigation (MDL), but an individual may also bring a toxic tort lawsuit.
