You're right, the effect of humidity would be to change the "apparent" size but it's not just increasing the number of particles that now fall in that bin but also growing some particles out of that same bin and onto the larger one.
How much it's "small particles becoming visible" against "large particles moving up a level" is not easy to estimate (it would be related to the available surface area that comes in contact with the water vapour).

That work in fact doesn't say anything about humidity because we didn't find anything relating the concentrations with relative humidity. That is not to say that effect doesn't exist, it just means that for the conditions we observed and the sensor we used there (Sharp gp2y1010au0f) the effect was not significant.
I do have some data in higher humidity conditions but the main effect we always saw with the Sharp sensors was temperature not humidity. The Plantower units we're using at the moment don't seem to show any impact of humidity or temperature ... BUT we've been using them in woodsmoke dominated environments which have their own response to humidity and for other more hygroscopic particles (like sea salt) that may be different.
My group is preparing some publications with the data we got last year so later this year we'll have something out and I'll make sure to include a discussion on humidity.
