Hi [@warren](/profile/warren) and all, 

Following your suggestions, I've changed a couple of things.

1. I've added headers to the "Find a cause" section. I've also added some tags underneath. Let me know if that looks good to you.

2. The methods section is now called "Get the right tools". I moved it down a little bit so it's now featured after the cause section.

3. Regarding the "how do I start something where I live", we could add a banner section that would just have one big button saying "Start a movement" or something like that. Where would that link to? 

I will focus on the text and linking next 😃 

As always, the design can be found here: https://edieblu.github.io/pl-welcome.io/

I would love to hear your thoughts everyone! 

Eva
