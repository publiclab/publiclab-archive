Hello,Sorry for the newbie question, i am trying to experiment on NDVI, i just remove the IR filter on a EOS 1000D so i am looking for filter i can mount on a 58 mm thread. Should i get on filter to get only the IR ( above 700 nm ) and another just for the Red ( 650 mm ( no so sure about his value )). Then calculate the NDVI base on this two value ? Or does it will be interesting instead of the RED filter just a IR block so i still have my three RGB channel ?
