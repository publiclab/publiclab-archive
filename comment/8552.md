I think the scope is good-- better to shoot for something doable and get it done-- there is plenty to do even if the technical work is a breeze. if the bulk of the technical work is done early, then I wouldn't doubt that UX revisions could run through a couple rounds and more than 2 weeks, especially nailing down the narrative functionality (I'm super excited about that).

Remember too that there will likely be other Mapknitter GSoC projects going, so leaving time for interface integration and coordination with the other teams is a good idea.   Having your project start a little later is an asset in that case.
