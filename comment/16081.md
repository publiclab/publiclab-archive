[@warren](/profile/warren) - I love this - "I'm thinking that if we design as if all technology is for newcomers, it's not just the newcomers who gain" and how you are starting to apply this to open source software development. One of the things I've realized as an educator is that my understanding of any topic is deepened by teaching it to someone else. I often have students teach things to the class and to each other. So I totally agree that "oldtimers" can learn a great deal by acting as mentors/guides/facilitators into a technology and/or community.
