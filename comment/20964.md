Applicants who create an application can edit it until the project application deadline. After your project's application deadline, applicants will NOT be able to create a new application. Applicants who have submitted an application cannot edit their application, but they will be able to continue recording and editing their contributions on the Outreachy website until the intern announcement deadline on Nov. 16, 2018 at 4pm UTC. Applicants who have not submitted an application will not be able to record or edit their contributions.
