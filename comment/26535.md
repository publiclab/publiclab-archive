One suggestion I have is to think in two main portions about this project. 

The first is the experience of using this system as a non-programmer. It can be really challenging to create new features in a way that is readable, easy to understand and use. I recommend that you try presenting some of these features as visual mockups in the way you might write a blog post to moderators on how to use them. You can highlight "what problems this feature solves for moderators" and keep in mind -- people are most likely to be able to adopt and use designs that they're already familiar with. Maybe good places to look for such "familiar" designs include Gmail's spam management, or other places people online often do this kind of activity?

The second is the technical "plumbing" of these systems. By separating this out, you have an opportunity to build an underlying system that works, and if the initial user interface (UI) is confusing, you don't have to rewrite the whole thing, just change the UI. Also, by separating out the technical planning from the UI, it makes the UI portion easier to read and respond to by non-programmers. Third, this division makes it easier to specify unit and functional tests for as opposed to system tests which may be best for UI. 

How does this sound? Could you sort your proposal a bit along these lines? Thank you!
