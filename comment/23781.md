 Hi [@samr](/profile/samr).  All the comments above are good and hopefully helpful and your questions are astute.  I'm curious as to what led you to "air quality" as a project?  and in particular what led you to want to use the PMS5003?  When I look at the product manual:
http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/aq-spec/resources-page/plantower-pms5003-manual_v2-3.pdf
it looks like a box to me with nothing going in and nothing coming out.  Are you technically savvy enough to turn the box into a usable tool? Or are you planning on working with something that includes the pms5003 but is already put together and yields an output that you can change? I believe it would also be helpful to know what level of schooling you are at and an approximate geographic location to be able to refer you to an appropriate governmental department that handles air quality.  Thanks.
