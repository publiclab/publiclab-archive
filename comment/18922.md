[@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1), you're dead right - the pitch of the pixels on the camera module (v2) is 1.12um so the fine particles do show up as little dots.  Fun fact - if you use the right illumination (has to be relatively well "collimated", an LED held ~100mm away should do), you should be able to see rings around the particle.  Those rings *should* let you calibrate the particle size very nicely, although given they are hard to remove from the sensor, it's an expensive single-use microscope!

I also had quite a few issues with dust on the sensor, that's why the optics modules are now single tubes - once the lens is in, the whole thing should be reasonably well sealed.  I originally had the camera and lens on separate mounts, but that resulted in a lot of dust on the sensor.
