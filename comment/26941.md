Hi, yes the red filter will capture the red wavelengths and the NIR can be slotted into the Blue channel, NIR will render&nbsp;as blue. You can still calculate your NDVI values by calculating the ratio of the NIR and red pixel values

> Hi there! Ya I did get the idea from your comment and thanks!  Just to reconfirm the concept, so if I use red filter instead, it will absorb green and blue light, in which in this case I have to capture NIR value in blue channel, hence my image will show in blue color?  Can you give your opinion on my result? Does it look promising? I was using one healthy leaf (left, bigger) and one unhealthy leaf to show the difference.  Thanks for your help again. You enlighten me :)
