OP again.
Mine is the standard (IR filtered) V2 camera, as I wasn't sure how the software would handle the non visible end. I've started investigating the focus issue and find that its quite a topic (thanks [@warren](/profile/warren)) https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=145815&start=200 and my version (2.1) is affected most - the lens has to be loosened and then it can be adjusted. Solutions are;
<li>tweezers or needlenose pliers are one way but this risks lens scratches, </li>
<li>a hack using a credit card, a 5mm drill and some filing/cutting https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=145815&start=200#p971545 </li>
<li>a hack using a 2 x 1 Lego(TM) block that I couldn't get much info on https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=145815&start=425#p1259809</li>
<li>a key - 3D printed https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1574661 or available from Adafruit https://www.adafruit.com/product/3518. A similar one is apparently supplied by RS Components with the v2 picams</li>
The last (Adafruit) is available from Core Electronics here in AU, so I've ordered one and will report. I'm also doing some rough tests to establish current focus at about 80mm which is the approximate distance from the camera to the collimation slit on the Lego Spectrometer.
