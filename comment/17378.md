[@KathleenSmart](/profile/KathleenSmart), I never got to the point of fully documenting the build process. They still need some work. Redesigning the sensor body so that it can be 3d printed instead of using a CNC mill, and there are a couple problems with the amount of power the voltage regulator can supply, and the voltage reference for the higher precision Analog to Digital Converter. 
All the design, code, etc. is in a gitlab repository here, https://gitlab.com/Tree_Water_Sensors/dendrometer. 

The way I built this out it needs a custom pcb, etc, etc. 

But it could be rebuilt using an Arduino Pro-Mini, and some breakout boards from Sparkfun or Adafruit. If you want to tackle it, I'd be happy to lend a hand to explain what is going on.
