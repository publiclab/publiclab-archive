Thanks Anish. This was a bit outside the scope of your project, but I'm glad you learned from it. Sharing this might help some other Google Summer of Code students who are working on similar problems, for sure!

I thought the projective distortion was something known in the GIS domain, but I guess Jeff found an implementation of it on some guy's website. The example from acko.net is missing, but he talks about it at a very high level without any mathemathics here: http://acko.net/blog/projective-texturing-with-canvas

Neither Jeff (in his thesis) nor that guy actually discuss the mathematics behind a projective distortion. It is assumed to be already known or a task left to the reader. So, as a reader, let's see what we can find out!

We'll learn this together. Here are some links I have found just now.

"A transformation that maps lines to lines (but does not necessarily preserve parallelism) is a projective transformation. Any plane projective transformation can be expressed by an invertible 3×3 matrix in homogeneous coordinates; conversely, any invertible 3×3 matrix defines a projective transformation of the plane. Projective transformations (if not affine) are not defined on all of the plane, but only on the complement of a line (the missing line is ``mapped to infinity'')."

From that, I get that projective distortions represent a very, very wide class of mathematical mappings. Which means we aren't going to learn much about it for our use case without being a bit more specific.

Here is a related wikipedia article discussing projective texture mapping, which is precisely what we want to do, but it is spoken about in terms of graphics processing. I mean, graphics processors. No math or anything, just pipelines.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_texture_mapping

Wikipedia says that "projective transformation" is another way to talk about "homography."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homography

That same wiki entry has some very arcane mathematics which is sadly lacking examples.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homography#Definition_and_expression_in_homogeneous_coordinates

Now that we know "homography", let's see how homography has been implemented!

Here's some code (in Action Script 3) that converts a homography (defined as a 3x3 matrix) into a rotation matrix and translation vector. The rotation matrix and translation vector are concepts I understand and know how to apply to graphical programming.

Related comment about how to decompose a given homography into rotation, translation, and also shear.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15420693/how-to-get-rotation-translation-shear-from-a-3x3-homography-matrix-in-c-sharp

That above question forwards on to a mathematical answer which I can finally understand, but of course I haven't learned anything more about the original homography matrix.
http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/78137/decomposition-of-a-nonsquare-affine-matrix

It seems like each person referring to a homography matrix either "has one" or "found one", but I can't any information about where the matrix comes from.

Given the mathematics, homography can be represented by rotation and translation (and maybe shear). Here's a page explaining some of the mathematics using computer science language. (Coincidentally I went to school at mtu.edu).

Oh hey, I just saw that the page above actually discusses projective transformations in a helpful way! I missed that when I first posted this comment, but I have edited the comment. Check this out: http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs3621/NOTES/geometry/geo-tran.html#projective

That page says clearly and directly that projective transforms are more general than affine transformations. So maybe we cannot truly represent a projective transform with only affine transformations.

At some point maybe Jeff will hop into this conversation and tell us where to look to find how four points chosen on an image relate to the matrices we are learning about.
