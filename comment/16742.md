Hello! Here to introduce myself, my name is Stevie Lewis and I'm really excited for this year (HI new students!!!) For a bit about me: I enjoy working with Public Lab from the community development side. I'm not a coder, but here to help in some other ways: 

- I'm a "people person" and can help out there for sure! 
- I know Public Lab's site and community work well and happy to provide feedback related to it. 
- I can also assist with design input - loosely! as in, not a great skill of mine, but here if you need to run anything by someone.  

This is my third year working with GSoC and I've seen some amazing projects come out of it from some pretty awesome people. Really looking forward to getting to know everyone this year, and seeing some of these cool projects come online! Don't hesitate to reach out!
