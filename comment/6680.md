I haven't wrapped my head around how to make a DIY hyperspectral image. I guess the idea is to make a photo of an object by capturing only a very narrow band of the wavelengths reflecting off the object. Then repeat that for each of many, many narrow bands. Then stack all the photos, so you have data for each spectral band for each pixel of the image. That is, each pixel is a spectrum instead of one color. That's a lot of data. 

I tried to give Ned's Fiji plugin pairs of RGB and infrablue photos of hornworms to make NDVI from a red and NIR channel, but it would not align the handheld photos. If I find more hornworms I might try it with the cameras on a tripod. The last hornworms are gone now. They are good grilled with an Argentinian Malbec.
