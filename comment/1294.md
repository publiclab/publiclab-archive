Greetings. Resolution is not linear to the used grating or the geometry. The size of the slit is one of the most important parameters influencing the resolution.

Yes, I have build a prototyp using a optical bench and now I am stripping the more or less complex setup down to the essentials - and so far you can seperate the Sodium-D lines with it ;)
(Well - I believe it's the D-Lines but have to reference it at the university)

Edit:
I was thinking about using Blazed gratings or esp. Echelle gratings but its difficult to get your hands on this stuff - for any reasonable amount of money.
