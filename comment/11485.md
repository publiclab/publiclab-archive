Hi IgorS,  Sorry about the slow response.  Things get really busy for me this time of year.  
The maximum and minimum currents that you will be able to measure are going to be limited by the detection hardware and by the fact that all the voltages are limited to between +/- 1.65 volts.  The equations are presented in this Research Note under the heading "Theory"; http://publiclab.org/notes/JSummers/07-04-2014/getting-your-wheestat-set-up.
You can simplify things by assuming that the offset voltage is zero.  In this case, the limiting currents are:

    i = 1.65(R5/(R4*R6)
R6 is 10 Kohm and R4 and R5 are determined by digital potentiometers.  The limits on the digital pots are 75 ohms and 50 K ohms.  This puts the theoretical limits on full scale current at 67 mA to 0.15 uA. 
The voltage resolution is currently at 10 mV per step.  That is sufficient for most electrochemical experiments that I am aware of.  Let me know if you need greater resolution.  it would be simple to change.  This is controlled by a couple of constants in the microcontroller code and I could guide you through it pretty easily.
One thing that I do not have a good handle on is the time resolution.  I usually do rather slow experiments (not more than about 200 mV / second sweep).  This is because most chemical systems don't react much faster.   I understand that there are systems (batteries and the like) where you want to sweep much faster and get time data out.  This is not something I have ever looked into, but if you want help looking at it, I am willing to try.
Let me know if there is anything else you want.
Best,

Jack
