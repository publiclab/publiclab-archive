Since the two main ways to control the sound are the saltiness of the water and the size of the capacitor, it would be cool if this list of parts included some other sizes of capacitors in addition to the 10uF, like a 1 and a 2.2.

Other supplies needed to do the things shown in the video demos include:

* a wire stripper (for the alligator clips used in the conductivity probe: https://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/09-30-2014/making-a-diy-conductivity-probe-from-a-water-bottle-and-metal-screws)
* a small screwdriver to open battery cases and such
* blinking RGB LED
