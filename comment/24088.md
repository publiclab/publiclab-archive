Oh, interesting -- can you share a screenshot? In general, I am wondering if we can be quite sparing with colored buttons so as not to overwhelm people with choices. But I'm open to&nbsp;suggestions and would love to see what you've got!

> Hi [@warren](/profile/warren) I saw your comment in one of the slides regarding blue buttons everywhere. How about keeping blue for primary and main buttons but for other features like tags and all, we can have many more great combinations. I tried this in one of my PR. And this looks great  Bootstrap has many button color classes, we can try them.
