Howdy --- This thread is a bit old but it's left unresolved. I have a little experience in this space, both in my playing with these lead testing strips and also talking to others that have. The overall consensus is that... they're no good and should be avoided. But... 

// COULD they be used? Maybe, if your goal is to determine that a water is not super high in lead count, then I could see a role for these. My sense is that you'd want to do at least 3 strips with the same water sample. If they all show up exactly the same with a clear signal that there's "zero" lead or that there's "a lot of lead", then that could be a signal; any signal that shows a "non-zero". 

// But these things are so hard to read. I'm putting zero in quotes because obviously there's not a true numeric reading. The strips I've tested have shown some amount of lead but not enough of a signal to provide any confidence either way.

Conclusions include "Strip results tend to under represent Pb level (for this specific study water). Also significant variability. Much more testing needed."
