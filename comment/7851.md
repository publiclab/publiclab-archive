Couple quick thoughts on the filter/clarity issue. For starters, I just ordered an a2200 for the infra blue purposes from eBay, so I haven't had a chance to look at the ir block filter myself yet, but:

1.  if the block filter is merely coated with some dye or material to block ir, could it be possible to chemically remove the coating without damaging the filter's glass? If yes, then the ir filter could be placed back in the camera and this should resolve the focusing issue...

2. Alternatively, I read on another thread that the camera developers build in a negative refraction factor into either the firmware and/or sensor hardware to adjust for the known optical refraction of the ir block filter, and therefore removing the ir block still leaves in place this other built-in compensation. If this is the case, and the correction is built into the firmware, perhaps there could be some form of chdk correction to undue the negative compensation?

These ideas occurred to me as I fell asleep last night  forcing me to wake up and write them down so I wouldn't forget, haha.
