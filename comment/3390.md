ICE is free and easy and worth having: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/UM/redmond/groups/IVM/ICE/

You can get a free account at Photosynth: http://photosynth.net/. To get a panorama uploaded to Photosynth, you have to stitch it in ICE, then click upload and its there.

If your panorama has at least 50 megapixels, you can also just upload it to gigapan.com (free account).
