> One change seems to be the desire to collect images by microscope. I have the equipment for this but need advice on what should be test images? I assume a calibration slide is appropriate https://publiclab.org/wiki/basic-microscope but itâ€™s also not a very fun reference and has no color. It may be a good time to try to measure something readily available (like a dollar bill) so that anyone could have a reference without paying $10 for a calibration slide.

Great question -- there are some ideas here; https://publiclab.org/notes/partsandcrafts/02-26-2018/6-looking-at-dust-and-other-things -- i like looking at things that move, but they're hard to keep alive :-)

> One concern is what is the best spectrometer for phase 3. After reviewing the different Public Lab kits, the lego spectrometer seems the best choice. Lego was selected since it was compatible with the Raspberry Pi camera and I could possibly share results with cedarlodge(from Public Lab), https://publiclab.org/notes/cedarlodge/03-07-2018/raspberry-pi-spectrometer-gui#comments, So is this OK?

That's great, yes. And if [@programmer1200](/profile/programmer1200) is willing, maybe we could send you some of the attachments he's working on? ( [#16042](/n/16042)) [@programmer1200](/profile/programmer1200) if you're still interested in swapping some with us, and could include a second set, we'd love to forward it along. But either way - we can just forward ours along too. 

> What is the policy for getting access to public lab kits and parts? Do I need to purchase or can Public lab provide? I would like to use 2 lego kits (one for visible and one for vis-IR ). Note I plan to use my own v2 cameras and Raspberry Pi. (Please tell me if there is there some reason why the lego kit spectrometer comes with v1 instead of higher resolution v2?)

Sorry, we actually already sent you things! I hope there's enough there - we can send you a second lego set. The camera thing is just a cost issue - we know people who want higher quality cameras can get them on their own... they're expensive for us to carry in quantity. But we'll probably start carrying both versions! 

Hope this is helpful! Reading your revisions above now.
