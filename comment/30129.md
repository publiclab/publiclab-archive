_as deadline is near, I do not expect you to implement the feedback now: this is smth you can think about or work on later_

Hi [@SomyaSinghal](/profile/SomyaSinghal), I really likr your mock-ups and that fact that you included the dark mode that looks amazing is really awesome. I am in love the welcome modal mockups -- that you included all the steps  wow! I appreciate your attention to detail, clarity and the work you put in your proposal ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ .
 
1 thing to think about: 
The elements on the responsive mock-up maybe some elements could be hidden/reduced or arranged better : I think there may seem like a lot happening esp on a small screen. what do you think?

Thanks for posting!
