Maybe try this brute force version with an infrablue photo with healthy plants in it:

 1) Select an area of foliage. 
 2) Calculate means for both the red and blue channels for some or all of the pixels.
 3) Based on the difference between those two means, select one of several NDVI formulations.
 4) If there is minimal difference, assume NDVI will fail, so resort to using the red channel (NIR) as a proxy for leafiness.

The difference between an NDVI formulation for good infrablue photos (well separated red and blue values) and bad ones (partly overlapping red and blue values) is two-fold. For bad photos, resulting NDVI values will be below the traditional range (0.2 to 0.8) and span a small range. So the adjusted NDVI formulations should result in two types of adjustment. 

For some poorly white balanced infrablue photos with completely overlapping red and blue channels, using the green channel is called for. So step two above should probably include the green channel to determine if it differs from red and blue more than red and blue differ from each other. If so, an NDVI equation including green may be the only hope.
