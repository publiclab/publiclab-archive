Hi [@mercyorangi](/profile/mercyorangi) thanks for your great work on this app! I have it installed on my HTC One S that is running Android 4.3.1

I see there have been some updates in your personal fork on GitHub, but they have not been merged into the publiclab repo and there is no .APK to download. Do you have plans to do that?

I am headed to Kauai with a balloon kit on Saturday and might try compile your more recent version before then.

Also [@ives](/profile/ives) I have luck getting better Lat & Long values when I open up Google Maps and let it resolve my location for 30-60 seconds. Then when I go back to SkyCam the location is not 0,0
