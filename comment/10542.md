Chris, yes I was holding the Titan rig while it triggered, there was no room for flying there (you can see the power lines in the upper left corner of the picture). Same thing for the panoramic at the top. We flew the Titan II from a balloon at site [#2](/n/2) but it was a bit heavy and suddenly lost altitude. It took a bath in the water but survived after I let it dry off in the sun. A testament to the durability of the Titan II!

At site [#2](/n/2) we flew the Infragram camera at near 1000 feet for some time, there should be quite a lot of data from it. I wasn't able to stay long enough later that afternoon to see final results but look forward as well.
