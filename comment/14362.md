I agree with all of your points regarding peer review (by whatever phrasing).  You're also correct about the term "citizen scientist", in that the term itself is prone to wildly different connotations:  My meaning might be more along the lines of "people with expertise or interest in a subject for which they are not formally recognized", while someone else might take the phrase as implying "revolt against corporate-, academic-, or government-centric control of research efforts".  

Same phrase, completely different interpretations.  I'm all for a better terminology, especially one that leaves the emotional baggage behind.  Sadly, I haven't found one yet.

I tried to navigate that gap a little bit by mentioning "augmenting" peer review processes, as opposed to replacing them.  I think that the work here is important in a bigger sense; having a culture war can flame out a community faster than anything.

I think that is a great idea.  Those points, especially, get to the heart of the discussion, in my humble opinion.
