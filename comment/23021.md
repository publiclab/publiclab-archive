Hi [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie), I'm not sure when EDGI's software website monitoring software will be available for public use (our developers are working really hard on it!!), but eventually you'll be able to use that. Another monitoring software is Versionista, and it looks like you can monitor up to 5 urls daily for free (https://versionista.com/about -- scroll down to the third box). Good luck!!!
