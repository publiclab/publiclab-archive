Thanks Jeff. I guess a handy feature of using a blue filter like this is that the NIR data is captured in the red channel. So with the right white balance setting, the photo from the camera can resemble false color IR images, as these do. Do you recommend a particular preset or custom white balance setting? 

I think you are right that the setting sun punched up these photos some, but the versions above were also passed through Lightroom and I think they got some saturation love. I really like getting the CIR-like photos direct from the camera. If your goal was NDVI, would you recommend a different white balance setting?

Thanks,
Chris
