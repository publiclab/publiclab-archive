The standard (last generation) Arduinos are circuit boards with the ATmega 328p microcontroller chip on them. A common hacker exercise eight years ago was to build your own Arduino board with an Atmega 328p chip and a pile of resistors, capacitors, wires, LEDs, etc. Today, factories in Asia make reliable clones of Arduino boards and sell them for $2.00 including shipping from Asia. If your goal is to exploit the power of a microcontroller, starting with a $2.00 board is a good choice.

Seven segment displays might be the least expensive way to display results, but LCDs, OLEDs, and e-ink allow any ASCII character to be displayed and OLEDs and e-ink allow graphics. A $4.00 display has room for 20 to 50 characters. This can improve the user experience.

If your goal is user interaction (the user inputs information and the device responds), a 328p Arduino might be too limited for this project. The memory limitations of the ATmega 328p might allow operating a sensor, SD card, real time clock, and display, but even those components are pushing the limits of the 328p. Adding an input device and the code that will allow something akin to gamification could push it over the top. This also might push the BOM over $15.00.

If your goal is user interaction (or other added features) you should probably upgrade from a 328p Arduino to an ESP8266. These boards cost $3.00 instead of $2.00 but have four times the memory, speed, and power of 328p Arduinos ([chart here](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/01-10-2019/what-would-you-do-with-sensorship)). They also have integrated WiFi, but you can ignore that when it is not needed. After you have upgraded your Arduino IDE to support ESP boards, the sketches for 328p Arduinos will run mostly unmodified on ESP boards. The extra memory will allow operating additional devices (other sensors, input buttons, sound generation) and also allow any code needed to support user interaction and nice things like cool fonts.

But if you just want to log temperature and humidity and maybe display the current values, you can do it for $15.00 with a 328p Arduino.
