For $25 that hydro generator has got to be a good thing. It is an impartial solution for my spring house because it can't freeze (operating range 4° to 80° C). 

The thingy has a 700 mAh battery, and it charges that battery, so it does not have to be running all the time to supply power. So it can be inserted into plumbing where the water flows intermittently and power a microcontroller continuously. The only plumbing I have where I also have heat in the winter is in the house where I also have power and therefore don't need to generate my own. 

It might be fun to experiment with a long hose in a mountain stream to see how far upstream (how far uphill) you have to put the inlet for the pressure to be sufficient to run the generator. Or we could ask an engineer who understands the Bernoulli and Darcy–Weisbach equations. I'm guessing you would need a couple hundred feet of garden hose and 20 feet of head to run the generator (that's a steep stream). Solar power will probably be more widely applicable, but if someone wants to power Riffles in a shady mountain stream, this might be a solution. 

Or you could just walk over to the stream and see if it looks okay.
