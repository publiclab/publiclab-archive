Chris, your comments are right on the "money" (pun intended). It looks like the best we can do with these budget cams, short of writing a new driver (if even possible given the hardware constraints), is have two modes: high res (1280x1024)/high lag (~0.5 sec); low res (320x240)/low lag(~0.005sec).

I'm not sure if that is possible and cheaper, but maybe we could do one USB camera and one ethernet camera, since on the Model B they are separate hardware controllers. Two RPi's is also a realistic option though synchronization would be tricky, but the money might be better spent on fancier cameras.

I'm mostly in agreement, but I'm going to toss out a hypothetical to the experts:
For the aerial mapping application, maybe the lag isn't as bad as it seems -- remember that the scene isn't moving, only the perspective is. If we take enough shots to get coverage, then maybe the images can be affine-aligned, then stitched into two sheets, IR and VIS, then overlaid. Another problem might be motion blur, but as you know, this could be algorithmically corrected too. We could call it an "IR/VIS point and shoot (and stitch) camera".
