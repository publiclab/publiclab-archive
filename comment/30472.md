Biomes are important because Biomes play a critical role in the understanding of ecology because they help scientists study not only a specific plant or animal but also the role it plays in its community an d the characteristics that it has developed to live in its environment. Aquatic biomes are probably the most important of all the biomes. Their medium, water, is a major natural resource. Water is the basis of life, it supports life, and countless species live in it for all or part of their lives. Freshwater biomes supply us with our drinking water and water for crop irrigation.
