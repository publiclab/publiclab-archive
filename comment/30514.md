     Some animals approach the brink of extinction if the slightest change in their environment because it can disturb nature's balance. They can become endangered from human pollution. The Nashville crayfish is an example. The creek they live in are polluted by people. Another is the Bald Eagle, the symbol of the United States that represents freedom. The iconic bird has unfortunately been affected by pesticides. Another way species are threatened are other species, invasive species.
     The Burmese Python is an invasive species of snake that has caused damage to the Everglades in Florida, especially to mammals and birds. They come from Southeast Asia, can grow to 18ft in length, and can weigh up to 200lbs. The way it kills prey is by clutching them tightly with their body, so the prey doesn’t move and swallow their prey whole. People used to own them as exotic pets, about 99,000 snakes were imported between 1996-2006. As snakes grew too big to care for, snake owners carelessly released them. Raccoons and bobcats decreased by 99.3% and 87.5% from 2003-2011. Foxes and rabbits had declined by 100% too. Inside the stomach of these snakes can be found deer, rabbits, raccoons, opossums, and bobcats.
