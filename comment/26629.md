I wanted to [share this research note](https://publiclab.org/notes/jiteovien/08-29-2018/how-to-evaluate-low-cost-air-quality-sensors) from [@jiteovien](/profile/jiteovien) on how to evaluate low cost air monitors. 

I've also been looking into [this Pocketlab air sensor myself](https://www.thepocketlab.com/store/pocketlab-air), but haven't had the time to test one yet.
