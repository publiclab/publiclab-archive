Update for week five: I spoke with my professor and weighed my options as far as disinfection goes. I have been surfing the web for the modes of UV disinfection as well as comparing them with other methods to determine why UV disinfection is more optimal. I am also currently thinking of ideas for which type of data I want to use my instrument to collect. Seeing as though bacteria are microscopic and are very difficult to obtain data from, it might be difficult to do so!
