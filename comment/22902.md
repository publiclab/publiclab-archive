Hi [@bbutler](/profile/bbutler), How did this turn out? Did you get it tested? Another thought is to go to a local state public health laboratory (general info about public health laboratories are here: https://www.aphl.org/aboutAPHL/pages/aboutphls.aspx). The PHL nearest you is in San Francisco, but from their website, it looks like they focus on human specimen analyses (blood, urine, etc). Here's a link to the state of California Environmental Health Laboratory basic page: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/Pages/Environmental-Health-Topics.aspx. I haven't looked to see how easy it is to locate a specific lab near you that would test soils (or hazardous materials). In any case, I just wanted to check up on how this went and see if you needed more resources. Let me know!
