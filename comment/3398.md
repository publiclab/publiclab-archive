The nearest edge is 59mm and the farthest is about 80. Are you measuring the angle from the line normal to the sensor surface or  parallel? If from the normal, the angle range is from 46 degrees at the closest edge to 59 degrees at the furthest edge. My previous designs used a slit-grating distance of 75mm and I found that 58 degrees was about ideal. Since this design is "universal" in order to fit as many phones as possible, the angle is a compromise of the various camera positions.
