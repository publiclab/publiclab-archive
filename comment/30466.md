Biology is the study of life. 

Abiotic: Non-living things 

Biotic: living things 

Interdependent:  every living organism depends on other living organisms to exist. They work together to establish a balance. 

A biome is a specific ecosystem where a biotic community thrives and relies on each other. Marine biome is the largest biome on earth, the majority is salt water. Home to 230,00 species. Marine plants are important because they provide more than half of the oxygen on earth. Freshwater has low levels of salt. Saltwater fish cannot live in freshwaters and freshwater fish cannot live in saltwater. Both freshwater and saltwater biomes make the Hydrosphere. Ponds/lakes, streams/rivers, and wetlands make up freshwater biomes. 

South of the arctic lies the tundra. It is part of the geosphere. 

The current world population is 7,969,216,492. 

There are currently 779,744,067 people without safe drinking water. About 71 percent of the Earth’s surface is covered with water. However, 97 percent is salt water. Atmosphere: The word atmosphere is derived from the Greek word for vapor. 21% of the earth's atmosphere is oxygen. Human activity is the reason why all spheres have changed.
