 hi! What a great project! I happen to live in the Williamsburg, Brooklyn neighborhood too and am so excited to hear about this. Will this sculpture be adjacent to any sort of flatish horizontal surfaces to collect rainwater off of, and will there be room to store water in a tank that is possibly higher than the sculpture in order to do gravity fed drip irrigation from captured water?
