All, My apologies, my question probably came across a bit harsh. One of those days on my end. 

One other observation on this particular issue that might help: the auto save versions weren't available when I was floundering around the first time. However, when i logged in again and was cut/pasting, I happened to notice they were there. Just a data point that might help track down the problem.

Thanks to all for their time and attention to these questions.
