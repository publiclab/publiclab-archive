SNOTEL uses snow pillows which are devices about 3m x 3m, that sit on the ground and measure the hydrostatic pressure of the snow that falls on them.  They have been around since the 1960s. There are 11 (traditional) SNOTEL sites at various, remote, locations around our area and I'm very familiar with them. As a data point, modern alternatives to snow pillows cost in the neighborhood $17K.  Last winter I used a Weaverboard and I misjudged the length of the stick that would be needed and eventually had to replace it.
