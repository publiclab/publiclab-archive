Great work [@Maggpi](/profile/Maggpi), and I took you up on your offer [@Warren](/profile/Warren).
A couple of relevant resources explaining the differences you mentioned in this post:
Edmund optics on distortion: https://www.edmundoptics.com/resources/application-notes/imaging/distortion/ It's very likely that the webcam doesn't show the same distortion as the pi as it has a smaller sensor and so doesn't cover the places where the main part of the distortion is.
When it comes to comparing sensor sizes (and some other parameters): https://www.edmundoptics.com/resources/application-notes/imaging/understanding-camera-sensors-for-machine-vision-applications/

BTW: if you want a hard copy (and don't mind getting one in the mail for all eternities) you can request them to send you a catalog, those usually have an intro with great explanations and examples.
