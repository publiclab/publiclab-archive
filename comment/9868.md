iframes can cause a lot of problems with SSL, which is in the works, along with some other cross site dependency issues. It's generally a bad thing to use if you can avoid it.

We could "upload" a research note by scraping the contents of the supplied page and putting that into the database, but it could lead to a synchronization loss with the upstream version on github. I don't have any recommendations other than the "edit" button could allow a rescrape of the URL.

Were you planning on exposing the markdown on github pages, or only the rendered HTML? If both are exposed, it should be easy enough for the scraper to look for the markdown text and import it directly.

There are going to be problems with embedding images if they are hosted elsewhere. Again cross-site issues. The internet is getting more paranoid, and as it does so, the web clients are getting more finicky about what they'll accept and from where.
