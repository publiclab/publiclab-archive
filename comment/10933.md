Hi Scott - Using public lab aerial photography for counting wildlife is a sensible idea. In your example image the resolution is probably your most limiting factor. If it is practical to fly lower or use higher magnification that would help a lot. That way you have additional cues like shape to work with. As you note, a tiny white blob can be confused with a lot of other features so you're forced to incorporate additional knowledge like behavior to get reasonable accuracy. At this point the simplest method is to use visual interpretation but automated feature counting is an interesting option.
