Hey jeff, nah man, that's kinda funny though, I might try that! Fluorescein is Ph dependent, the baking soda maximizes the dye's energy transfer. As far as the oils go, the specific regent of NaOH (sodium hydroxide Ph of 12.38) is necessary for the 20 percent ethanol mixture, to break apart the aromatic double bonds. 

I will set up a series of experiments with the fluoresein and oils since this is really my primary focus, very soon, I just needed to get the spectrometer running the way that I want it to. I am happy with it's operation as of now, so it's good.
