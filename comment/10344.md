Aw, shucks :) But yes, it's so cool that we might find some part of design solution space that satisfies all of these!

Before Ben pointing me to trimmer capacitors, though, I did start to feel that it was actually pretty cool, as per Jeff's idea, to have electrodes on a ruler -- so that the user gets a sense for which physical parameters affect the conductivity measurement (the distance between the electrodes in the water being one of them).  Turning a capacitor knob isn't as directly intuitive ... but it still leads down a path to understanding the "RC" part of the oscillatory circuit, and there's no reason we can't *also* do the 'electrode on ruler' idea, too.

In fact, maybe: first you place the electrodes (screws from the hardware store, fixed with paperclips, as per Jeff's idea) on a ruler, changing their separation until you get into the right frequency ballpark; and then you use this separation distance when placing the screws in e.g. a plastic bottle cap (for rigidity / stability), and use the capacitor trimmer for fine tuning.

It'd be pretty rad if doing things in this way, and generating audio frequencies that get sampled on a smartphone / laptop, leads to a more sensitive and reliable instrument than $40 or even $150 conductivity probes on the market.  And those probes don't support 'data logging', whereas we just need to record the audio file (which you and Jeff have pointed out repeatedly).  AND the data is directly intuitive, when calibrated against a standard tone -- "middle C" is always 1200 uS/cm, say.  This is going to be so cool.

Chris suggested at LEAFFEST that we write up all of the 'benefits' of using audio, and the resistance --> frequency setup, for folks who haven't been privvy to all of our mad brainstorming around this.  Let's do that in a wiki / etherpad soon?
