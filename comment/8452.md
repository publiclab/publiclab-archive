Dave,  
This is an excellent idea.  It looks like you are able to get much more information out of typical spectra. A quick look at recent spectra at SWB suggests that many of the images do not have attenuation at the top and bottom (but maybe they are cropped?). I wonder if it would work to have a gradient filter in the spectrometer so any image had variable intensity from top to bottom. Do you think a continuously varying slit width (from top to bottom) would work? Maybe not if you had problems with the stepped slit, and that would also vary the resolution.
Nice concept.
