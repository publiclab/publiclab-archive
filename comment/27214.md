I prefer to construct a light light weight [concrete block](https://cementconcrete.org/concrete/types-of-concrete-blocks-masonry-unit-hollow-solid/2462/) house in which we make a air flow filter, then continuously regulate and observe the air pollution level. Then graph for a regular interval monthly, weakly or yearly is plotted. By interpolating the graph we can find the critical time on which there is high pollution level. [note: here we use [light weight concrete](https://cementconcrete.org/concrete/lightweight-concrete/2413/) because it is less expensive]
