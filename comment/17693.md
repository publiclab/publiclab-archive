Teams? There are going to be teams? Will they have T-shirts?

I'm still not sure overlapping code is relevant. If you have a working sketch for a KnowFlow and you want to start programming a Riffle, you don't start with the KnowFlow sketch. You find your friend's sketch for the Riffle and change what needs to be changed (hardware libraries, hardware initiations, hardware reads, sampling interval, variable names, pin assignments) depending on how your friend's hardware and goals differ from yours. If your Riffle uses the same sensor or RTC as your KnowFlow, you might be able to borrow a few lines of code.
