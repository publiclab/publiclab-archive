Sorry for the late reply, but the Dusttraks and Dylos, to my knowledge, do not have sensor out-ports. If I would be able to see what the connector for the sensor out-port would look like, I could look into the Dusttrak for the same port. We're in the process of buying an environmental enclosure for the Dust trak II which will be very similar to the Dusttrak I environmental enclosure, seen above. Another improvement is that we are planning to buy tripods. As for the cyclone on the Dylos, I'm not sure if that will be much of an improvement since it already sorts out the PM2.5 and PM10 particles.
