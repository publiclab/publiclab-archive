Hi Jay,

This is a great example of how important it is to get a good exposure on spectral photos. You have to hit it just right to get the most information in each spectrum.  If you miss by a few f-stops, you don't get much at all. There is probably a whole lot less variation among fluorescent bulbs than there is among your exposures. I haven't used a smart phone spectrometer in a while, but I remember looking for a good camera app that allowed easy manual exposure control. Taking bracketed photos is also a good idea, especially if the app will combine them for you. I never tried that. I did try a narrower slit, but that only made a little bit of a difference. I used 1000 lines/mm grating replica instead of DVD, and that might have helped some. [Here](https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/2196) is one of the first CFL spectra I made, and it's described [here](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/1-4-2013/foldup-spectrometer-iphone).
