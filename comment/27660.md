The goal is to have an official CAG, right? First of all, Id reach out to the reporter and tell him how his mis-reporting of this issue has caused harm to your community. Tell him the goal is to have an official CAG, and ask him to reissue another factual story.  If he does, then you have something to go back to the EPA with. if he wont for some reason (but why wouldnt he if he is a reliable reporter?). Tell him you intend to send out your own press release explaining what happened. Send a copy to the EPA. btw- each EPA region has their own community liason.. find out who that is and start connecting with them too. hope this helps.
