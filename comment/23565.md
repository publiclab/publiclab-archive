A better UI and UX is key to anyone visiting the site. Most of what is in my proposal is to better the sites UI in general that first timers or even already existent users can have a better interaction with the site. It's good to give a welcoming feel as the implementations above will. Also for the FTO issues, first timers should have an easy time starting to contribute to the project. I aim at making the Open Source experience worth it too.
