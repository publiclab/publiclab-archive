Hello!

On the Image Sequencer project, I have completed the core functionality of the module and will now be working on Unit tests for the same and Module Input/Output and building a Node.js as well as browser UI.

The functionality is in place and can be tested as written in the `Readme.md` by pulling https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer
