My thoughts exactly! 
Its easy to fall into a mindset where citizen science is defined by a particular toolset rather than an end for which any means may fit.  For all the expertise one may encounter in "enthusiast" communities like [diydrones.com](www.diydrones.com) or the [Berkeley KAP discussion page](http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/kap/discuss/index.php?p=/discussions) the overall emphasis doesn't always align with the goals of citizen science.  Which at the end of the day will always be about making high performance tools accessible to as many people as possible.  

 Something I've noticed about enthusiast/hobby communities is that they tend to value the highest quality materials and components, whether its a $250 KAP Foil kite or a $1200 Quad.  Almost always, there's a very good reason for such an investment, but this is also assuming that building the tool is the goal itself.  When the goal is to map the effects of deforestation in Brazil or invasive crabs in coastal Maine, a quadrotor, ROV, weather balloon or kite all might have a place, but only insofar as the time and resources required don't detract from the larger project..
In such cases, the collective knowledge of enthusiast communities can be incredibly valuable.  But whenever I find myself wondering whether or not to spend 3/4 of our project budget on four Tiger Brushless Motors, it helps to remember what I'm actually using them for...

  and thats my rant for the week...
