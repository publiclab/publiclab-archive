Dave, would you be able to add your notes to existing issues in our tracker, and/or create new ones for your excellent suggestions?

One I though of today and added was: 

[display if users have calibrated their devices](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/issues/79)

by scanning for their spectra tagged "calibration"

Also, perhaps we can show how good the (most recent) calibration is by running [@Sreyanth](/profile/Sreyanth)'s autocalibration matching code against it.

A display of what % of users have calibrated would also be nice, perhaps over time
