Yes. Mining affects Radon levels.Miners in uranium, tin, silver, coal, and other types of underground mines increase radon exposure. Good ventilation can effectively reduce the incidence of lung cancer in miners.
The added risk is unclear regarding medical exposure, which can exceed that from radon.

Also in homes, Radon particles combine with Air, Groundwater, and soil. sometimes due to cracks, floors and walls Radon might enter in  which increases Radon levels
