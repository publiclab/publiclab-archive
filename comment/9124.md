Hello, I was in Perugia at the Journalism Festival (second day, rainy, no wind at all...) -  Now I have made a wooden picavet (like yours) and then recovered and tested a kite I had - first without picavet - but it proved to be really too unstable to attach to it anything... in Perugia you informed us about artisans selling handmade kites the same price as commercial ones - I looked for something like that on PublicLab.org, but I haven't found - would you be so kind to give me a link, please? Thanks
