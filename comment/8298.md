oh that's great to hear about your process on this. There's a group of Brazilians who are moving towards a portuguese language mailing list, and we are musing about whether to name it as "-Brasil" to indicate a regional group, or name it with emphasis on the portuguese language, which would theoretically enable a more global useage. Although i would be so excited to have a global portuguese language list, i think what this is, in fact, is a regional list that happens to employ a non-english language. 

Pragmatically, it seems that the first place of connection for both spanish and portuguese speakers will be these language-specific lists, even if most of the time they serve a regional purpose. That seems perfectly fine to me, how about you?
