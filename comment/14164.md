Good news people.
It seems that the problem is represented by the compatibility of the versions of Fiji and Photo Monitoring.
Installing the versions suggested by Ned Horning the program proceeds sent up to 100% processing.
My doubt however is this:
Photo Monitoring in the NDVI calculation, working with a formula in which there is the value of VIS and NIR.
With our MAPIR cameras, we acquire pictures in the band of RED and NIR: Photo Monitoring properly perform the NDVI index processing?
How to apply the caption of the LUT file?
Thanks for collaboration
Gianni.
