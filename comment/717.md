Randy has confirmed that a good experiment would be to:

1)	Build the MK111 timer without the relay.
2)	Solder a wire between pin 3 (OUT) on the 555 and COM on the J2 terminal block
3)	Solder a wire between GND on the J1 block and NO on the J2 block

It should then be possible to power the whole thing with just one 5-6v battery pack, and that power will trigger the camera shutters via the USB cables.

Can you guess if I am going to try this?
