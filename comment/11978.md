Nice mosaics. 

The color images seem to have a typical range of colors. These look like good results. Can you explain why you were expecting something else? It's hard to evaluate these results more fully without knowing things like which filter was used, how white balance was done, what the crop is, what the Fiji settings were, and what lut was used. I assume this is NDVI.

The unprocessed images look a little too brown and not orange enough. If the crop is young and most of the field is bare soil, the dominant NDVI values might not reflect plant health.
