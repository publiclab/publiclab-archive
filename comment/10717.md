Mat,
That's a pretty nice spectrum. Are you going to try adjusting the grating angle by 5° or so in either direction? I'm not sure it would make any difference or if the web cam could capture the difference, but it might be worth a try before you lock down the angles. When I [tested a DVD+R](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/2-12-2013/grating-angle-dvdr) the best angle for a 20 cm slit to grating distance was about 65°. The angle was closer to 60° [when grating film was used](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/2-5-2013/grating-angle). I never tried DVD-R
