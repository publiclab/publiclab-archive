Pushpaw, thanks for the reply.

>>  Not sure why you mention auto-focus, you don't want it, and I'm pretty sure the camera that ships with the spectrometer doesn't have it.

I mentioned Auto-Focus, just guessing what if the camera model I received is not correct and what with I received a model with Auto-Focus. I took a picture of the camera and it says "NB23 S2", and the model I found on AliExpress (https://bit.ly/2m2ezVf) says it's fixed focus. So maybe this isn't a problem. I also removed the grating completely. So when the lid is lifted, I can get a good picture. When I close the lid, the image turns completely dark.
