As you might guess, it is method 180-1.

The photometer listed recently might be a good start on a turbidity meter, but it does need some work on the optical bench.  The change needed in the optical bench you documented above. The light source and detector would need to be at 90 degree angles. This is the photometer that used a laser led with the lense removed as the light source.  White light would be better, but...
