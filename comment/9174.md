Chris, interesting point about the tags and software.

I use picasa, as it lets me scroll through images faster than windows preview alone. I've used it on XP, 7, the other one, and windows 8. 

What I do like about the naming system that we have stumbled into is that it's pretty platform-neutral, while containing three kinds of information. 

It would be nice to have something that displays the photo on a map, or the lat / long, more easily, as windows doesn't always make that part of the EXIF data very obvious. Picasa does this mapping thing better.  I use flickr a ton, and I like flickr for sharing and webhosting, although it only seems to be going downhill as yahoo tries to monetize everything.
