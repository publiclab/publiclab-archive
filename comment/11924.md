ran some tests on the different Kitagawa tubes that have been used.  

I put the end into the drilled-out brass tube I've been using to break them, and use a steel nail file to scratch a circular break line onto the edge right against the brass break tube. this produced clean, circular breaks, but breaking both ends in the same place resulted in two different diameter openings (see tube 3, below).

My hypothesis is that the tube with the narrowest opening would have the lowest airflow.  the three used tubes I have do not confirm this hypothesis. each tube had three flow tests in a 250ml graduated cylinder (averaged here).


tube 1
left side opening: 1.7mm, right opening: 1.3mm
40.5 seconds to traverse 200ml = .296L/m

tube 2
left opening: 1.4, right opening 1.8
43.5 seconds to traverse 200ml = .276L/m

tube 3
left opening: 1.25, right opening: 1.9
44.8 seconds to traverse 200ml = .268L/m

putting a valve in front of the tube doesn't seem to normalize the flow.   I'm inclined to believe [@davidmack](/profile/davidmack) that we can't get around measuring the flow of each tube, or excepting some error range around the tubes' differences. Getting clean, consistent breaks doesn't lead to consistently sized openings. The size of the openings does not appear to be the primary driver of flow change.

On the bright side, the tube's don't seem to change flow-- so I don't think they necessarily have to be flow tested DURING sampling.  they may be flow testable when off-site.  that may work in a library mailing situation.
