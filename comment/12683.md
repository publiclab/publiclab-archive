I am absolutely positive that the most common forms of Hg are Hg(0) and Hg(II) -- my whole PhD is on mercury, specifically on Hg isotopes.  The only thing I can think of for why they might say that in Wikipedia is that oxidation states are officially described for atoms that are in molecules or forming molecules, and Hg(0) is monatomic and inert (mostly), so maybe it is not an official oxidation state? Regardless, everyone discusses Hg(0) as an oxidation state.
