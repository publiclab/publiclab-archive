[@justinmanley](/profile/justinmanley) - openDroneMap solves image stitching in a different way -- using structure from motion. But MapKnitter also provides georectification, or placing images on the earth. So one big driver for the modularity of the Leaflet.DistortableImage project is that it could be used as a georectification interface for already-combined-but-not-yet-placed images from ODM.
