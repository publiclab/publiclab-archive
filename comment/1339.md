this is awesome! thanks for posting all your notes.  I love your fold over pocket design, really clever.  

Green bamboo is more flexible than dried bamboo, but cured bamboo is best if you can find it. I get some from an importer here in Portland, but it is hard to find.  Alternatively, hardwood dowels (oak are fairly available) work great.

the Cow Hitch is also called a "Larks Head" sometimes, and if that isn't holding in place, try a Prusik, which is just a cow hitch wrapped three times:

Tyvek can be hard to buy in small quantities.  I habitually check all construction dumpsters I run across for scraps, and have asked construction crews for scraps as well.   Good thought on a bulk kit order-- we can put that out on the Grassroots Mapping list.
