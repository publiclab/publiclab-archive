While I don't have a VisuaLight board to test on yet (I did just order what appears to be one of the last ones on Square?) I tried connecting the IR Eval board to a Leonardo as part of the work in this research note- http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/01-22-2014/thermal-flashlight-using-mlx90614-ir-evaluation-board-from-sparkfun.

 While the original intent was to enable the outputs on the Eval board so as to eliminate the need for another Arduino, I have yet to get this to work. It does work as a standalone sensor with SCL-A5/SDA-A4 on the Uno. I wanted to try the same sketch (the standard bildr.org sketch) on an Arduino Micro as it is much smaller and would yield clues as to how the sensor would work with a 32u4. As both the Micro and Leonardo have dedicated SCL-SDA pins, I figured I would use these instead of A5-A4 on the Uno. Oddly enough, I couldn't even get that far as it wouldn't even let me compile the sketch while a Leonardo was selected in the dropdown. As soon as I change back to an Uno, it compiles and loads fine. I thought maybe the error output might be of some help-
