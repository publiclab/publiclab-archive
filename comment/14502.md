There is a discussion of controlling the white balance on the Raspberry Pi camera here: https://publiclab.org/notes/LaPa/12-03-2015/how-do-i-set-a-costum-white-balance-of-the-noir-modulo-cam.  
There is a discussion of calibration here: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/05-01-2016/calibration-cogitation.   
Software to compute NDVI from an image is discussed here: https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/07-22-2015/introducing-the-calibration-plugin-for-imagej-fiji.  

To manually calculate NDVI you need to access the DNs in each pixel. To do it for one pixel, open any jpeg in Fiji and the three DNs (R, G, B) are displayed for the pixel the mouse is hovering over. For a blue filter, use the R number for NIR and the B number for VIS and plug them into the NDVI formula. Repeat for all five million pixels.
