Hi [@nearsys](/profile/nearsys) sorry for the delay in replying! [@liz](/profile/liz) thanks for flagging this. [@nearsys](/profile/nearsys) your image is fantastic and it's wonderful to hear about your experience with APT stations in 1992! You seem more than qualified to be testing APT decoding through software defined radio :)  

To answer your question, yes many people use low noise amplifiers or LNAs to improve the signal to noise ratio on 137 Mhz and therefore improve image length and quality. This article linked below includes a note about an LNA that was useful to the authors, but there are many on the market.

[@sophied](/profile/sophied) and I don't use LNAs since we are able to decode very long images with our turnstile antennas, and found that orienting the turnstiles properly really helped us pick up more of the north and south of each pass. But we are certainly interested in experimenting with LNAs and other amps / filters in future. 

Do please share more of your experience especially if you end up testing an LNA !
