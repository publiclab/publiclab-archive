Hi, Jack - well, maybe I'm looking too far forward here. A laptop running a Processing app sounds great. 

Is there a kind of listing of graphs of common metals which might be included with the potentiostat as references, or markers in the interface indicating where to look some feature in the graph, like a spike or trough?
