The Ogallala is in Wyoming, South Dakota, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. The Ogallala has been used for irrigation. If the Ogallala dried up, it could take six thousand years to fill back up. The negative impact on the U.S/Nebraska if the Ogallala didnâ€™t exist would be tremendous. The depletion can affect cattle, the water can become salty for cattle. The depletion can affect more than $20 billion worth of food will disappear from the world's markets.  It provides nearly all the water for residential, industrial, and agricultural use.
