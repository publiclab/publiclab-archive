The only reason that I would want to fly both at the same is to kill two birds with one stone and get both an NIR and visible light image (in "true" colors) without flying two surveys. I'm not so concerned about precise camera alignment because at this point I don't have a need to combine the two images. For that matter, precise syncing isn't important yet either, I just wanted to experiment with external triggering. Originally I had planned on two unmodified, aligned, synced cameras to make stereoscopic images but since then I've learned a lot and found that tools like VisualFSM and others can give me the results I need without stereo cameras. I'm interested in trying other filters like the Wratten 25A you mentioned (and mentioned at http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/10-30-2013/red-vs-blue-filters-for-ndvi ) and I'm willing to open the camera up again to see if that might fit our needs better. I'm still deep in learning phase and trying to figure out how to apply the techniques that Public Lab has pioneered so I'll be experimenting more and asking a lot of questions in the near future I'm sure!
