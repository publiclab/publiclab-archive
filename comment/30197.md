Another, more current option , is to use a coffee grinder.  With the temperature issues this material shows, probably using the frozen state would be good, if possible. Throw the samples in the freezer the night before, then prep them in the coffee grinder.  Make sure the minimum amount of time necessary is used.  Don't know if it would work.  But it sure would save time.
