My experience is that blocking all the light from a LED indicator is a lot harder than you might think. Other than disconnecting the LED's almost nothing will guarantee no light escapes. You could try smearing a blob of plasticine or blutack over them, but you still tend to get diffused leakage (from the PCB mounted LEDs) through the PCB itself.
