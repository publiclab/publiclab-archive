Andresc4,

Your UAV photo pairs are great quality. They are sharp and rectify with each other easily. I used [Ned's Fiji plugin](https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin) to align the pairs and make NDVI images which look biologically meaningful.

[![IMG_0093a_NDVI_Color_2Cam.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/002/682/medium/IMG_0093a_NDVI_Color_2Cam.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/002/682/original/IMG_0093a_NDVI_Color_2Cam.jpg)  
*Above: NDVI using the red channel from the normal RGB photo for visible light and the red channel from the infrablue photo as NIR.*

*Above: NDVI from the single infrablue image using the blue channel as visible light and the red channel as NIR.*  

I made some assumptions about your photos:

- The pink photos are infrablue photos taken with a camera that was not [custom white balanced](http://publiclab.org/wiki/infrablue-white-balance). It would probably help to do that procedure. 
- The pink photos were taken with a camera with a Rosco [#2007](/n/2007) filter replacing the IR block filter. I guess you put the new filter on the inside.

Fiji and Ned's Fiji plugin are free and can process single camera infrablue (Infragram) photos as well as dual camera (VIS and NIR) pairs into NDVI and false color IR images. It's too bad you were led to the Photoshop procedure, which is way harder and less precise than Ned's plugin. 

If you are going to use two cameras (one for VIS and one for NIR), you will get a more pure NIR channel if you replace the IR block filter with an IR pass filter like the Wratten 87. But then you will not be able to get NDVI from one camera. For a one camera system that provides a pure NIR channel, use a Wratten 25A instead of Rosco [#2007](/n/2007) and the blue channel will be very pure NIR (use the red channel for VIS). 

The FPV video cameras you plan to use might have CMOS sensors which handle NIR light very differently than CCD sensors. So be prepared to do some testing. For example, I have not heard of anyone using a Wratten 25A filter in a CMOS camera. It's wide open territory.

It looks like you are off to a good start.

Chris
