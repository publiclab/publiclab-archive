Hey Dave! I don't know either about the higher signal level at the 406nm peak. That makes sense about testing the acrylic and quartz together, I know the acrylic ones are cheaper but are more prone to damage from certain solvent mixes and preps. I have a wide assortment of glass when Edmond Scientifics use to sell defective and chipped lenses in bulk, but those days are over they don't do that anymore but I still have a lot of them.
