$20 too much for the splitter? This actually looks like pretty good quality and they have quite a few, maybe they would come down in quantity. Lots cheaper than Edmund's for sure.

As a small token of my appreciation for your obvious commitment to PLOTS and as a sign of mine I just bought you one for proof of concept. When it gets here in several weeks I will let you know and arrange to send it to you.

You might also consider teleprompter glass. A 1' square piece of 60/40 beamsplitter glass should cost less than $100 and if we can cut it up successfully it could yield over 100 pieces. Wouldn't that be cool.
