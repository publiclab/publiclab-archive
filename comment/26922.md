Just following up - i see that:

1. it seems that re-ordering manually does not result in a different request being sent to the export system; when I ran this and then moved the smaller image to the back and re-ran, it still had image with id = 85 as the first image in the request. I'll look into this:

[![Screenshot_2020-06-02_at_11.32.08_AM.png](/i/39597)](/i/39597?s=o)

Output:

2. however, I also saw that interacting with other page elements like tabs could in some cases deselect the images, and also re-order them (possibly back to original order?) so that could be a second issue. I'll open issues in GitHub for both but will prioritize the first as I believe it'll be easier to fix. Thank you!
