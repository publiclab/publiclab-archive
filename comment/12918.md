HI Guys, Thanks for your interesting comments! 

Jeff: 
I will certainly try to do that. In general I am trying to find out what could be a realistic ratio of oil:water. To start we figured out 1:20, I am using right now, but I would like to start working with a smaller one. Any suggestions what that ratio could be? BTW Randy Austin, chief of Spill Response Program NYC DEC, mentioned that an oil spill in general creates a sheen only if the water is quite saturated. That might mean that the ratio might not be as low as a few drops. I think I am going to do a small quick experiment on that - just adding drops to water and looking for the amount it will create a sheen.

Matthew:
Very interesting! I did not know about the wax. That might be it. Will try to heat it up and take couple of spectra. 
Clipping of 05W30 spectra: Yes. This one is burned out (clipped) because I wanted to show the "blue tail" between approx. 255 - 350nm and approx. 430 - 530nm. Usually I take 3 spectra of each specimen. The ones I took from the recovered 05W30 are not showing much for some reason:

I think I will take the spectra again.
