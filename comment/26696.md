Thank you very much! The concern is less about reach around the head and more about the tightness of fit. 

This study shows that healthcare workers w/ full beards never achieved adequate fit.

this study suggests simply using a second face mask could work instead of changing the design of the mask. unsure about efficacy! https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3293316/
