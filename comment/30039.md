Hi [@yravianand111](/profile/yravianand111)! Just letting you know the deadline is coming up very soon -- please post what you can here so we can provide feedback, hopefully before the final submission! We'd love to see some wireframes or sketches of how the full-screen UI in particular might look. It doesn't have to be too polished, but just so we know how you might start the design process. Thank you!
