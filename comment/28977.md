This is an interesting model from the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) for collecting bathymetry data. They have established standards, protocols, and a 'Trusted Node' network to help mariners collect crowdsourced data. The 'nodes' may help by supplying the data collection equipment, giving technical support while collecting the data, post-processing the data, and delivering to the IHO. It builds the network out from the data steward out to the contributors. https://iho.int/uploads/user/pubs/bathy/B_12_Ed2.0.3_2020.pdf
