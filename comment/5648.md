This sounds like an excellent first outing. There are some tips for using the A495 for aerial shots here (http://publiclab.org/wiki/canon-a495-tips) including infinity focus mode. There is a tip about using CHDK to keep the shutter speed high at the bottom of the page here (http://publiclab.org/wiki/dual-camera-kit-software), but the speeds of your shots (1/400 and 1/800) are good. Reducing camera swing is a good goal. Some Powershots have wider angle lenses than the A495, but not by much. The A495 field of view is a very useful compromise for mapping and general aerial shots.
