Jut did a really crude test, the image displays as it should, green in the cracks, green algae or whatever it is on the fence. The small panel in front of the planter box is the foil panel. It pretty much shows up black on the floating point image. When you mouse over it I get values from -0.0 to almost -0.2. I am not sure what this is telling me to be honest of if I can do anything meaningful with it.

I did notice that my lens had come loose and therefore the focus was off. I refocused it for this image, but I will need to get it just right and set it in place with some glue or something to prevent that from happening in the future. It could be a reason for the not so great images during my previous testing.
