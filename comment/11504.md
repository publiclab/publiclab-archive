When Jeff asked me if I wanted to take pictures of his first attempt to balloon-map a courtyard at MIT, I thought that it sounded like a fun excuse to go outside that plausibly fit within my job description, so I readily agreed. We blew up an enormous helium balloon, set up the "stabilizer" (cardboard taped to a plastic bottle head), and experienced the joy of trying to untangle a hundred feet of string without a proper reel.

The full set of pictures is [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/crimsonninjagirl/sets/72157622707750293/#).

The designs and varieties of the kits and the size of the community has changed dramatically in the last 5 years, but some things have stayed the same: a sense of curiosity and experimentation, a commitment to co-designing with activists, impressive MacGuyvering skills, and Jeff's dedication to excellent outerwear. Happy 5th anniversary, Public Lab! It's been incredible to watch you grow up, and I'm so excited to see what you get up to next.
