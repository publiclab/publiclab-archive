Sometimes different cameras use only one channel to focus, in order to work faster (less time combining channels before calculating). If they use the blue channel, the red filter will block the channel needed to perform focus calculations, and the focus may suffer. 

Also, some lenses are just optimized for certain color ranges. But the blur you're seeing seems more than would be accounted for from that effect. 

I hope that helps!
