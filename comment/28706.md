Hi Barun - thank you, that's good research. I'm quite in favor of an external stand-alone solution which doesn't add complexity to the plots2 database, esp because many spatial extensions are database specific, and wouldn't work with mysql, sqlite, etc -- I've definitely been down that road before and it is complicated. I am not 100% against it but my preference is to look at option which read in data via a standard access format like JSON (which is already available in plots2) and then create and maintain a self-contained efficient geodata store with premade indexing. I also like that this could involve a ready-to-use solution for storage, and that we might simply write the import script and run it periodically as a job. 

My sense of cons on database extensions is that they place a lot of narrower requirements on our database choices in plots2, and the extra processing of populating and maintaining the tables is something we could bypass by externalizing. Does this make sense? Thank you!!!!
