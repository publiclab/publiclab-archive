Great talk. You've done a great job at making this video informative - so U awarded you a watchdog barn star 

Anyhow, cutting to the chase. The issues that you are talking about are the same across the entire mining industry, no matter what the substance being mined is.

You might appreciate doing this short intro course on mining engineering. (https://www.open2study.com/courses/mining-engineering) I have done so & it outlines quite well how mines should operate. I perfonally found it helpful in identifying the differences between how mining should be, when done safely and to a certain standard, vs how it actually, very often, usually is.
