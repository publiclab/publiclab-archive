Hi! With only the infrared image, and no visible light image, you can't do NDVI, unfortunately, as NDVI requires *both* visible and infrared. Did you not have an Infragram camera? If you have a pure NIR camera, you should consider modifying it with a red filter to be a full infragram camera and get both channels at once.
