Link 1: Overall, the water quality in Louisiana is good due to the clean water act. Under this act, the discharge of pollutants is heavily regulated and monitored. Other programs have been developed by the EPA for different methods of pollution control in order to better protect our bodies of water. 

 

Link 2: Right now, more than 2.2 billon people are without access to water, much less clean water. Better water security is required to resolve this issue. Groups like the World Water Council have come in to help secure, sustain, restore, and protect our many different water ways and water sources in order to make sure that as many people as possible have access to clean drinking water.
