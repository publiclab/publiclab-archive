Hi [@niklasjordan](/profile/niklasjordan) , I'm reposting from [@stevie](/profile/stevie)'s response over email :)
Hi Niklas,
Thanks for getting in touch, and for pointing out that page - it needs a bit of an update. We've moved away from the chapter model for organizing because as you noticed here, it relies on having a local person to manage it. Public Lab is global (here are posts and projects from Germany), and emphasizing place based projects and issue based projects as the starting point for organizing allows us to bring more people in without requiring formal structures for local organizing! Here are a couple ideas for you and your friends in getting started on Public Lab: 

- Join Open Call: if you're interested in talking to others and brainstorming how to start a project or where to plug in on something ongoing, this is a great place to start. There is one today at 7pm GMT today (and every Tuesday).
- Post an Issue Brief: is there an environmental issue you and your group are already thinking about locally? Posting an Issue Brief is a good way to get started sharing and engaging others on that issue.
- Post a question: already have something in mind you'd like to ask and explore with others? The Q&A is a great easy way to get started sharing. 

Looking forward to seeing you on Public Lab soon!
