Why dont you do some community soil testing in areas where folks could be the most exposed? Plus, its much easier to test the soil as a surrogate for what was in the air (vs air sampling). This way you are not relying on the government officials , and you have your own data!!!
This is what we did in Tonawanda, NY. As a result of our work, we developed a toolkit.   Plus I think the chemical you are talking about is Benzo-a -pyrene. Its very dangerous. PAH's are a group of over 100 chemicals , of which, these are the most dangerous :Acenaphthene
Anthracene
Benz[a]anthracene
Benzo[a]pyrene
Benzo[e]pyrene
Chrysene
Flouranthene
Flourene
Phenanthrene
Pyrene

I can also provide you with the SCO (soil cleanup objectives) we used, if interested.
