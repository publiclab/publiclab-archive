I'm worried though that your images are not taken with the same calibration, so the wavelengths may not be comparable. Also, in this sample, I see two overlapping spectra, so the colors may be mixing: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/49972

And in this one (https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/50007) the spectrum is at a very different angle, so I worry that you have not taken it under the exact same setup. See how in this example, most of the spectra start and end at the same wavelength?

But the blue spectrum (#5) is much wider (starts earlier and ends later), so in that case we aren't as sure that it has a matching calibration. It surely was not taken with the same setup!
