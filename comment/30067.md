Hi [@Girija0707](/profile/Girija0707), thank you for your proposal! I like how you have suggested the navigation bar as a way to organize information on the page in a consistent way, I think it's a persuasive argument, and would be more compact too!

I'm curious about what you think of the potential for a responsive layout for the toolbar which has buttons like Presets, Run, Save, etc. It's got a lot of content and can be overwhelming to people. How might we design a full-screen, edge-to-edge layout (like https://photopea.com/) which could better organize these tools and also make better use of screen real estate?
