Thank you both, I really appreciate your help.

My tiles were far from perfect, but from next week on I will be able to test with six Spectralon samples (from white to black). That should provide much better results.

Just a question to you both - in Table 3 (or „DNG: no WB” sheet in the spreadsheet in my drive), the green and blue pixel values are much higher in Image 2 (with R72 filter on) than in the other two images - they are more or less equal among the three channels as the camera can only see NIR. Can you think of any explanation? Why would pixel values in green and blue channels increase after putting on a lens filter? The exposure settings were all the same among the three images.
