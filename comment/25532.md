Hey [@mushroomman](/profile/mushroomman), 

I can see this post is several years old by now but if anyone reading this is interesting in connecting over fungi / mycoremediation, let me know! I am based in Minneapolis and interested in creating spaces here for people to work on mycology projects. Would be great to talk with fellow mushroom enthusiasts in the midwest and around the US / other countries.
