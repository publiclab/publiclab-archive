Great to see this comparison. Do you have a link to where these webcams might be purchased, and prices? 

Also - I think you had some thoughts on the Raspberry Pi camera which is pretty affordable and high resolution. Would you mind linking to them or re-iterating here? I just bought one myself, and during the [#webvalley](/tag/webvalley) tests this past summer found that they have very low baseline noise in the "black" regions of a spectrum.
