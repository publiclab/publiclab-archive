Copying in a comment I just left on the DustDuino post:

_So I think the sensor the Speck is using, the "Syhitech DSM501A" (http://publiclab.org/notes/chrisbartley/04-15-2014/speck-particle-monitor) is ~$2, and the CMU folks said it compares well with the Shenyei ($15.90). I'm wondering about a radically cheap sensor that's just a Digispark ($12) plugged into the Syhitech sensor; it could cost < $20 total and just plug directly into your laptop. Or, could show an RGB LED with a color mapping for concentration. _
