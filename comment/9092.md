Ah -- great thoughts!  And your comment points to an important issue, which is that I myself was unclear (and still am, a bit) as to the utility of the 555 for this purpose :)  I'm still learning as I follow Ben's lead, but here are some (perhaps relevant) things that I only as yet vaguely understand: 

- we want to put very little current through the water, both in order to conserve battery power, and in order to avoid polarizing the water around the electrodes.  using the 10 bit Arduino ADC to distinguish such weak voltage signals might be hard (i think?).  this sort of echoes your suggestion that there's an 'amplifcation' rationale for the 555, here:   we can set up a trigger in the Arduino code to fire every time the oscillating 555 signal reaches VCC, with a time resolution of microseconds, which should be sufficient for the 1kHz frequency we're shooting for ... 

- the ADC on the Arduino is [optimized for impedance of 10 kOhm or less](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/67171/input-impedance-of-arduino-uno-analog-pins) -- much greater than that, and the voltage used to make the measurement may 'droop', and throw off the measurement (I think).  The resistance of tap water, between two steel electrodes 2 cm apart or so, seems to be in the mega-Ohm range.  There may be ways of addressing this dropping with op-amps though, I think ... 

- whatever signal we use to measure the resistance we'll want to do in an oscillatory fashion, ideally above 1 kHz or so, so as to avoid polarizing the water (by shunting ions towards one of the electrodes) and plating / corroding the electrodes over time.  The 555 method helps in this regard, too ... 

all that said, there's a simpler approach than the 555 that satisfies all of these constraints, too:  placing a capacitor in series with the water, then charging up the capacitor, and measuring the amount of time it takes to charge to a given voltage threshold -- this time will be related to the resistance of the water.  This is what the K20-based Riffle does currently, but there are some tricks involved in getting the auxiliary circuitry right, and I'm trying this easier-for-Don-to-grok-for-now 555 approach just to get something working ...  eager to try this other way of doing things soon, though ...
