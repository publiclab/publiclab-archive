I wonder if Home Depot or other big-box hardware stores rent these as they used to (and maybe still) rent lower-resolution thermal imagers -- it used to be ~$70 per day. I'm sure they don't imagine people putting them on kites, but if it were well protected with a case, and/or if they have an insurance policy or damage waiver of some sort, perhaps it could be a more affordable option?
