Final note as we prepare a new activity for Raspberry Pi kits: you need to remove the lens from the Pi camera, which is a bit tough. We've loosened them for you and in some cases removed it. You'll need to take it the rest of the way off, and then you can assemble the rest of your Pi in the case with the camera-hole cover. More pictures coming soon!
