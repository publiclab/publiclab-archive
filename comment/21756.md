To your very first question, "How predictable is the search function (do you usually get expected results the first time?)" i have anecdotally heard many reports of this, however the behavior is not repeatable by the person who reported it or by others. My feeling on Search is that it is too complex to debug the Typeahead Search at the same time as debugging the Search Results Page. For this reason, I wish to temporarily disable Typeahead.
