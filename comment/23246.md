Magnification in this context is the relationship between the size of an object and the size of an image of that object. 

1. Assuming the hatch marks on the calibration scale are 0.01 mm, then the ostracod in your photo is 0.23 mm wide. 
2. The ostracod  is 55 mm wide on my monitor. 
3. Therefore the magnification is 55/0.23 or 239x.

This magnification applies only to this particular viewing situation. If I view the entire ostracod image on my phone the magnification will be different. This is how the magnification of a digital image differs from the magnification of an optical microscope. Everyone who looks through the eyepiece of the same microscope experiences the same magnification. 

So your microscope does not have a single magnification. Magnification depends on the size of the displayed image.
