Biodiversity is important on planet Earth because every species relies on each other and is interdependent, including us. We rely on thousands of species regularly for food, air, clothes, and anything made from plant or animal product. An ecosystem is constantly in a delicate balance, and one species going extinct can throw the balance off, potentially severely.
