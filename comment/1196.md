Hey Liz,
Thank you very much for your comment.
I read about TreeKIT a while ago and found it very interesting. I want to understand what exactly it takes to run this kind of project, and to think about a way to use it here as well.

The future of these trees is not so bright, because the municipality is pushing a so called "affordable housing" project in this area. They chose to do so in a very aggressive way and against the guideline that was decided using public participation process.

I admit that i oppose any kind of building on this piece of land that in my opinion should become an ecological land, mostly because of its location adjacent to the main bus station of Tel-Aviv.

This is the place to mention that the trees' past was also not so nice. They were uprooted and got stolen from the Palestinian Occupied Territories by the state of Israel about 6 or 7 years ago, and replanted were they are now.


Shai.
