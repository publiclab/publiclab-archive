Hi Warren,
I followed through your tutorial. Here is the VIS and NIR images that I captured

VIS Image

[![rgb.JPG](/i/45011)](/i/45011?s=o)

NIR Image

[![nir.JPG](/i/45012)](/i/45012?s=o)

This the output generated with Gimp

This is my 1st time making NDVI image, I am not sure if the image I made is any good, could you provide me guidance or advice? Thank you for the amazing tutorial.
