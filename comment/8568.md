Great; the paper should help. Now move the lamp about 4 ft away.... the bands should no longer look saturated.

A couple other thoughts. I've not used the phone app, but I wonder if the software is detecting some reflections and so being fooled. Another thought is perhaps the rotate function visually works, but there's a bug in software that does not handle the rotation correctly. Granted those are not user-available.

Just ordered the kit .... should be interesting to check its performance.
