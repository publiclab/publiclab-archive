Hi, [@rjboyd00](/profile/rjboyd00), please don't use disrespectful language in any Public Lab space -- we work hard to preserve a respectful and welcoming environment, and we appreciate your help in maintaining it so. You can see our Code of Conduct at http://publiclab.org/conduct

Feedback is always welcome, of course, and I think a different choice of paper may make it easier to fold. Likewise your idea of printing an enclosure sounds cool and I encourage you to share your improvements on the site here.
