The sketch looks beautiful! it just inspired me to make a dirty sketch of my own. As a lot of features will be coming up this summer it would be necessary to have a management tool in place of the regular upload interface. From the discussion I think I should start with implementing the features of image selection(and highlight selected image), show/hide toggle in the next iteration. Would displaying other info like locked, modified, etc(probably with a 'more' trigger on image to go with the minimal design) be necesssary?

I've bought up a minimal interface with auto upload and drag/drop. Would it be necessary to have an exclusive drop region? I'm not sure of the problem of using the entire map as the "drop zone", the novice users can however fallback to the traditional approach of selecting files/folders for upload. 

I'm a little confused about ordering, how should I approach this problem. Is ordering necessary as in Mapknitter once a larger image is locked over a smaller image the smaller one is automatically layered to the top.
