The relative amounts of NIR vs visible light in each channel is definitely a big and important unknown. The camera can't do anything to change that, but different WB settings can modify the proportion of the three channels used. All of the camera's WB presets produce almost identical results, but Powershots seem to be able to apply custom WB settings way beyond the range that is useful for normal photography (This is Infragram serendipity, because custom WB settings in some cameras have limits).  The wacky WB setting we can produce with blue paper under blue light is a major hack that seems to make useful infrablue NDVI possible. So far I have not figured out how to do this after the photo was taken, even if it is saved as camera raw (but there must be a way). 

The most surprising result here is that lots of NIR gets into the blue channel in this camera, but that it can still produce useful NDVI. I still don't understand that, but it does show promise that some amount of NIR leakage into the blue channel is not game over.
