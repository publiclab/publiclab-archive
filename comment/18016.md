Hi [@Warren](/profile/Warren)....!!!
I am glad to tell you about my recent collection of Star spectrum.
By profession, i am a Geographer, Senior Geographic Information System (GIS) Engineer+ Digital Cartographer and an Amateur Astronomer (Selenographist) by hobby.

About Betelgeuse Spectrum:- The reason why i captured the Betelgeuse spectrum is that it is a super giant star at its last stage. It will explode anytime to become a Supernova. The Spectrum analysis is very helpful to study the configuration of a star & it also helps us to know the Red/Blue Shift phenomena (same as the Doppler effect). I have captured spectral bands of many stars in order to study their spectrum & especially the absorption lines presented within their spectrum. It tells is about what gasses covers a particular star.
About Sirius Star Spectrum: Recently i have captured another star spectrum which is the brightest star on Earth's Sky, known as Sirius Star or Dog Star. It is the brightest star basically emits silver bright light. It can be easily identify just below the Orion constellation. It is also one of the hottest type of young star.
Equipment & Techniques used to capture Star Spectrum:  
Meade Telescope- 70mm, Nikon D7100 DSLR camera attached via T-Ring, & with my own homemade diffraction grating- 1000 LPMm.
