The prices at Aliexpress seemed to be the about the same as at Amazon. 

Some of the product descriptions at Aliexpress named the sensor. For example [this one](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4k-Wifi-Ultra-HD-Dual-Screen-Waterproof-Underwater-Sports-Action-Camera-with-Remote-Control-Time-Lapse/32754520607.html) has a Sony Sony IMX179 sensor. The camera is promoted as a 4k camera with 16MP photos, but that sensor is an 8MP sensor. I think that is very typical for these cameras.
