I'm curious why you need at least 3 bands for automated classification. I don't have a specific classification task in mind. In general I'm working on identifying different features (predictor variables) from DIY aerial imagery for a range of classification tasks. I have a strong interest in this and reasonable experience. If you have some thoughts perhaps we can take this discussion to email since it's heading off topic? Then again, I don't mind continuing the discussion here.
