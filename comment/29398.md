In followup to this --
For example, to change the styling of a button, it depends on if the appearance in plots2 is relying on CSS that's in the Editor library, or if it's customized in plots2. 

You can use the Chrome dev tools to see where the CSS rules are coming from. While running in development mode in plots2, if they're from `/public/lib/publiclab-editor/dist/___.css` or something like that, they're from the Editor library. But if they're from `/app/assets/stylesheets/editor.css` (or something like that) they're part of the Rails app's custom styling. 
Complex, but I hope that makes sense!
