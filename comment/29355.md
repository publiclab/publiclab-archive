If you have a proposal up and it's not appearing here, please reach out and we can get it tagged properly so it does. Thank you!

Final proposals are due Nov 5, so we prefer to see them early so we can help you refine them!

And we are most of all looking for a plan around how you'll do the work described; we are open to new ideas but definitely want to hear that you've thought through how the ones we already have described will get completed and when. You can list your unknowns, your questions, your process, in the proposal, and we love to see that!
