Hello abaker1617. I got you questions in my email but for some reason they are not showing up here. First of all I was holding off on publishing the files on Thingiverse because I wanted to make some small adjustments, like adding a lid. Currently the lid is untested, so proceed at your own risk with that one, but here is the link to the files: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:711557. Secondly, the measurements of the WheeTrometer 2.0 are a little different then 3.0. This is because I am using a different size mirror. Lastly, I have put the code for the microcontroller (written in Energia) and the GUI (written in Processing) here: https://github.com/SmokyMountainScientific/WheeTrometer_3.0
