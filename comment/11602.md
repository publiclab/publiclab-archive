Overall my favorite Public Lab memories boil down to the first time I meet people in person after having had extensive conversations with them via email or phone and experiencing how our relationships progress as we come to work closer together. Each of these individual interactions is transformative for me. 

A particular moment that I'm reminded of from the very early days was wading through the water off of a beach in Mississippi. I was waist deep, attached to a balloon that was hundreds of feet above me and Mariko, who I worked with at the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, was tracking me on shore with a GPS. I heard her say “oh look, it’s a shark!” and remember feeling my stomach flip and drop. I “ran” to shore through the murky water hoping that I wouldn’t bump into the shark only to find out that it was a two foot dogfish floating along the shore, not the bull shark poised to bite me I imagined in my head.
