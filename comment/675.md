Great! I should try the same thing. 

So the 23A battery was my best attempt to find a lightweight and cheap 12v source. But it seems it is not enough. Would 2 or three of them in parallel help? Or we could start googling around for 3 or 6v batteries that don't weigh much.

Gah. If we could find a relay that doesn't require as much power, or switch to a transistor of some sort, this really shouldn't be a problem. This is an old circuit design, and was probably based on the idea that you'd be running it off some reasonably powerful source, not a tiny lithium battery. They were probably thinking about a model train set transformer.
