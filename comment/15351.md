[@dhaffnersr](/profile/dhaffnersr),

I would be happy to help in any way I can.  I will try to post something on your recent work this weekend if I can.

In the meantime, I can say that the kind of work you have been doing is exactly what I believe is necessary to support the community when it comes (inevitably, in my opinion) to convincing someone that there is an important finding.  Doing the basic scientific and quality-control checks directly contributes to the overall power of Public Lab in general, and prepares for the eventualities that [@warren](/profile/warren) is talking about in this note.
