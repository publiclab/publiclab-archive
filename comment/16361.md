Hi Suman.

This is my setup…  Mobius Action cam Docking station + Foam anti vibration tubing… all held on with quick release cable ties. I have the 6mm lens from Public labs


I set the unit in parallel to the main camera on the front right leg (- with a slight forward bias to counter the tilt of the quadcopter when flying forward). This gives me the opportunity to use both cameras in tandem.


I also use Clip - on prop guards and mount a 10gram weight on the opposite rear guard at the furthest point and underneath the plastic guard. - This balance weight is essential to get the Quadcopter to be in balance. (I use two 5gm car wheel stick-on balance weights.)

I set my airspeed to 13 miles per hour and the time lapse at 5seconds.. this gives me plenty of overlap and the quad is flying level at all times.

( As I now know what the camera is seeing I have removed the  Transmitter unit from the mount and also the battery that was supplying power for the transmitter (mounted on the opposite rear leg)

 Mobius ActionCam FPV Docking Station with Mini Video Transmitter 5.8GHz 32ch 200mW = $38.23 - From Hobbyking

Occasionally I get some slight distortion from vibration (jello) - this is very noticeable in video mode.  Other than that

I use Fiji App and embed LUTS from NDVI sources. to get my batch system running  I wrote a Macro : This processes all my images. Currently typical run is 400+ photos. this takes about 1min 30 secs to process  I then send everything to iMovie and create timeline video.. or just send the finished images to an iCloud folder for later use.

Hope this helps
