Hello [@tonchuks](/profile/tonchuks), thank you so much for your proposal. I wanted to reach out to say that due to the limited number of slots, we must make difficult choices each year, but we deeply appreciate your work and your proposal. I hope you'll consider applying with us again in the future and we are happy to work with you in whatever capacity going forward. Many thanks.
