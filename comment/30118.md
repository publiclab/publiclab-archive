hello! thank you so much for your feedback. Yes, I looked into Bootstrap library and this theme will require customization but  we can achieve it using SASS to create utility API, then using SASS compiler extension we can compile sass file into CSS.  
The "upload image and webcam section" will be a fixed landing page (home page).
No logo and all will not disappear, I will  add a sub page (nested sub page) for editor. I hope it makes sense, I'll edit my proposal for better understanding
