Hi! I think the question of rolling shutter might deserve it's own question posted, to really dig into - it's a great question! One thought I had was that the orientation of the camera probably has a big effect on the banding. Banding I've seen can often look like venetian blinds, and doesn't seem to have an effect that's inconsistent across each cross-section of the image. That is, the banding has typically happened at a resolution that makes bands in parallel to the cross-sections, limiting the damage they can do. But if the camera is rotated 90&nbsp;degrees, that'd change a lot. Probably we need to start citing specific spectra/images to really dig into this topic. Thanks for bringing it up!!!
