Is nail polish remover just acetone, and is it pure enough for this?

(Except for non-acetone nail polish remover, of course)

https://www.amazon.com/Super-Nail-Pure-Acetone-fl/dp/B009SDJQCI - ~$5 per bottle, though we should probably not mail this around as part of a kit? 

Leslie, do you think you could add "or nail polish remover" to the title here so we can sort of hit two birds with one stone in the Q&A for the project? Thank you!!!
