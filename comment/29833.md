Ever since plastics have been created, their production have only been increasing.  And because almost all of our plastic gets wasted away in the ocean, 83% percent of tap water contains microplastics.  Then the water that does get cleaned and purified is just put into plastic bottles which entirely defeats the whole point of purifying it.
