For `[bright][suggest:1234] vivid [/suggest]`, I think that may run into collisions if you want to change, for example, the word "suggest" (haha) -- so maybe:

`[suggest:1234] bright [to] vivid [/suggest]` (acknowledging that this markup would not typically be directly edited; it'd be generated by our UI)

Does that make sense? Then removal could be like:

`[suggest:1234] bright [to] [/suggest]`

However, we might want to start with the interface as I described where you make edits and it does a suggestion to the whole paragraph rather than asking people to select/replace individual words (just as a simpler model to attempt first) and then once we're more confident in it, develop ideas and a UI for replacing at a finer level of detail, like individual words. 

I think it may be hard to anticipate all the possible failure cases with such a complex feature -- for example, preventing improperly nested suggestions, and managing broken ones if someone inadvertently breaks one like `[/sugges   t]` -- which could cause chaos. There are lots of possible problems we'll have to try out and write good tests for! It's probably a good idea to start collecting these test ideas now.

As for the resolve option, i think you're right in terms of who it's probably targeted at. But it's hard to know, and maybe people will want to resolve their own (i do this sometimes on Google Docs). So by showing a short text message to help people understand that it is a suggestion, we don't /stop/ people from resolving it, but we hopefully offer enough explanation for what a suggestion is intended for so that the right people are the ones to actually /use/ it. 

Thanks for your thoughtful responses and changes! Much appreciated.
