Hi jenjimah, 

Testing any of these and reporting back would be worthwhile from my perspective. One word of caution is that these are very bright reflectance targets and can easily saturate a camera sensor so you will likely need to experiment with different exposure settings. Also, keep in mind that the calibration routine that I set up requires at least two targets with different reflectance values.
