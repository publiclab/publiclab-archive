HI all, 

I thought I made a comment on this earlier today but apparently I did something wrong (again). It's great to see more people digging into the classification. It's possible that some patches of water chestnut look different than others due to "contamination" from nearby pixels. This might be exacerbated by the JPEG compression but in any case scattering on or near the surface and within the camera optics will have some influence but I still don't have a good sense about how significant it is. 
As far a trying to normalize the image by correcting for illumination differences I'm not sure that will be possible since we don't have information about the orientation of the features (leaves) being imaged. There is often a hot-spot in aerial images that can be reduced if you have sun angle and camera orientation data but since most of the vegetation in these photos are on the surface I don't expect the hot-spot has much influence.
