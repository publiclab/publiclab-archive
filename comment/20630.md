Very cool! it would be great to have more of that info on your sampling and analyzing approach on your website as most project don't have as advanced a method as yours--it would maybe help for buy-in. We have built some colorimetric analysis apps that have been validated in an exposure chamber (results are under review rn) for HCHO with good success. here's the code if its of interest https://github.com/publiclab/SmART-Form . having multiple test types imho would be tricky especially on the low cost side of things, but with your tenacity maybe it could work out! Thanks for the detailed response and god luck as it moves forward!
