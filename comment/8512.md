Hi Jeff and Dave!

Thanks for your timely feedback. I actually cloned, setup Infragram and started looking at what can be done (as the deadline is too close!). Since, I realize that there are still some great features I can work upon, I would like to modify and cleanup the proposal.

I will better work on the following:

1. automatic calibration (Lets try developing a functional linear calibration module first. And then extend it following what Chris and Dave suggested -- the non linear model)

2. Macros for SWB.

3. I also strongly believe that the refinery watching feature can be implemented using the macros. Can't we, Jeff? Lets put the macro system developed in [#2](/n/2) to work!

4. Offline version of SWB. Lets leverage the HTML5 additions as Jeff rightly pointed out. But I was wondering if that would slow down the system (a huge dataset right? -- so proposed using local files). Will do some reading and get back to you!

My thoughts (which I didn't post previously):
I think we need to provide an option for manual calibrations too, at least in the initial phases of development. This way, we can analyze such manual calibrations and find in which cases our module is failing.

Also, I don't think only ensuring an user is logged in is sufficient for uploading the offline spectra. I am afraid there may be some robot attacks which may result in Denial of Service. So, lets use the CSRF tokens to make sure only valid spectrums are uploaded. To make sure this system is secure, we will need to develop a new, faster and secure way to upload the spectrums.

Offline SWB: I have a feeling that we need to use the SWB API to the fullest for this project. So, for this, I would like to refactor a part of the API code and document it where necessary. This makes our approach much easier. Also, the entire macro system can be used here! Isnt it?

So, this should actually let us use offline SWB for refinery watching, once developed completely.

Thanks
