Hi [@namangupta](/profile/namangupta), regarding sockets, I'd like to suggest looking at the Notification API implementation I mentioned above, as this could play a role in React and other plans here, but is perhaps a bit higher priority for us, as it'd more directly support some of our current infrastructure. 

For others, I appreciate the enthusiasm around React, but want to caution that we are most likely to experiment with a single small React prototype that replaces just one interface on the site, in order to learn more about working with React, treat it as a pilot, and evaluate, rather than taking on a really major rewrite as the first step. So if folks are interested in React, I encourage you to consider presenting it as a narrow evaluation project, does that make sense?

Regarding chat, one major consideration is that our current chatroom is quite complex already - we use Riot/Matrix to bridge Gitter, Slack, IRC, and others, and we have some careful bot and settings work keeping that space free of spam abuse. So although we're open to ideas, I think we might be more enthusiastic about some of the "Core mission-driven projects" above. I say this not because I doubt your abilities -- i really appreciate your ambition and enthusiasm!!! But just because these are needs coming from our broader community and we have a responsibility as an organization to prioritize them. Thank you so much!
