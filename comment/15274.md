That's a good point about the instructions.  if they were teased out into the different rig designs and each set of instructions stuck to one design at a time, assembly would be faster and clearer.

Your suggestion reminds me of Lego instructions-- Lego doesn't tell you can re-make the pieces in a variety of configurations-- they just show you how to assemble one model.
