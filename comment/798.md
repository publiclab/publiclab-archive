Thanks Safidy,

I found UFRaw last week and it worked well, but I don't think it does batch processing.  I tried Raw Therapee today and it is a much more complete program and does batch conversions.  It crashed on the first batch of eight I gave it, but recovered and finished the batch on restart. It can convert to uncompressed tiff which is what ImageJ needs. I think it is the solution I was looking for.

Now I need to learn whether saving CHDK DNG is better than saving CHDK RAW files.  

Can you do these CHDK RAW conversions in Photoshop?

Thanks again.
