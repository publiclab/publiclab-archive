Today we learned about environmental population of specie who were endangered but now reproduce rapidly to last for the next 100 years. This species is the native black bear. We have also discussed the animals that were native to Louisiana and what was not. Discovered more knowledge on the different types of fish and weather conditions that is leading Louisiana coastal line to erosion.
