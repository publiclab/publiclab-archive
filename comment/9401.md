Haha, true enough and this rough placement is already exciting! 

I'd love for you to get this running on a test server, and to see how you've integrated it. Are you in touch with Dogi on the chat channel (http://publiclab.org/chat)? Can you ask him if you could have access to test.publiclab.org (i think you've already sent your public key).
