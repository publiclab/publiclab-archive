Lesson [#2](/n/2) reflection prompt
Collecting microplastics along the Mississippi river was very eye opening. There was a lot of plastic pollution in and along the river. I mostly saw plastic bottles and shopping bags. These plastics will take hundreds of years to fully disintegrate. Because the Mississippi river is a big water source for us, its concerning because the water is full of microplastics that can enter our bodies and make us sick.
