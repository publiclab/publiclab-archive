Pasting in comments from the [plots-waterquality list](/lists) -- 

There's arsenic in some Somerville soil -- especially at the Kiley Barrel site right near Union Square, near the planned Green Line station: http://www.epa.gov/region1/removal-sites/KileyBarrelAllenStreetSite.html and at this bike path, according to the MASS DEP's flickr stream: https://www.flickr.com/photos/massdep/4521022562/

The low-cost soil tests offered by UMass Amherst's Soil Lab test for arsenic, for an extra $5 on top of their $55 Total Sorbed Metals Test: http://soiltest.umass.edu/services

I just read this article, though, which talks about extracting arsenic using sodium hydroxide (lye?) and phosphoric acid (a food additive), both easily purchased -- then igniting it into plasma and measuring its emission spectrum with a spectrometer.
