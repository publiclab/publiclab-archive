With non steady-state sources, measurement error results from asynchronous data sampling. The 'fix' is either long integration time (assuming the source RMS level actually is stable) or a measurement rate several times the nyquist rate so the sample data represents the actual signal.

Wavelength calibration via CFL (using PLab-class devices) is typically limited by system noise which causes spectral peak 'smearing' and 'jitter' -- though a bit of processing can help.

Finally, assuming stable DC light sources, with PLab-class devices, the biggest measurement error source tends to be broadd-band, non-Gaussian noise generated by mechanical instability.
