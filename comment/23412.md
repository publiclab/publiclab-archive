Yes, currently we display only the images associated with the current map. But we'd like to query a new controller method in warpables\_controller.rb which would return /all/ images within the current view, and to add them to a new layer group (making sure none are added twice), but not editable. That way you can see other peoples' work alongside your own -- although we'd want an option to hide that layer group in case it starts getting too crowded. This would involve some "bounding box" query in Rails, plus some Leaflet code to display the images.&nbsp;
  

Actually, i think we could use Leaflet Environmental Layers, which already has a MapKnitter API query to fetch maps in a given bounding box; then we'd just have to switch to displaying full images once you zoom in far enough. I've made an issue here, check it out!&nbsp;[https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-environmental-layers/issues/153](https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-environmental-layers/issues/153)
