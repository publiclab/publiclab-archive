[@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) We will have to modify both, as changing the geolocation APIs, making it more user friendly, marker security, etc. these will be done in the library itself. And the subscription and emails will be done using existing API for leaflet blurred location, integrating it to plots. [@warren](/profile/warren) what do you think about it?
Glad I could be of help :)
