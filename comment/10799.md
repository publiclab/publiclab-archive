Hey there [@markwh](/profile/markwh),

This video explains the process quite well:

I use a toaster oven also - just be careful that you don't let it get too hot - otherwise the stage after what you see in the video clip is it turning into resin and burning.
Also, I find that putting a wet towel over the top is important - as it captures any fumes that are given off.
You can make sticks for hot glue guns using this technique - they are like the 'melts' you get for making molds.
