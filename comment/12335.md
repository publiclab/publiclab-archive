Also, regarding the noise you believe is a result of instability without even applying force to the spectrometer housing, what do you think is the mechanism for that? I'm most concerned about wavelength drift, and the idea of stability-related noise is surprising and unexpected. Do you really think there's some way that mechanical instability can create video noise?
