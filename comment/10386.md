Dave, we're getting similar brightnesses between our readings of different oils by varying the concentration and/or light path, which seem to change the brighness without effecting the emissions curve. With the crude oil its actually hard to get a dim enough spectra-- with olive oil we have the opposite problem.

It seems you'd prefer we keep the light path consistent and only vary the sample-- but dialing in the concentration to get the right emissions is going to burn through sample preparations/cuvettes. Do you think we could use neutral density filters to knock the brightness down instead? I started to use a polarized filter for this purpose and it looked effective. 

With just a filter change, then we could keep the lightpath the same, keep sample prep and concentration of oil the same, and just switch out a filter.
