Adam,

Microsoft ICE seems to work okay for stitching some sets of vertical mapping photos.  It has four stitching modes: one for a camera rotating in the same place, and three it calls "planar." I assume these are for images of something flat, and not necessarily taken from the same place.  The planar modes definitely work on map images sometimes, but some sets seem not to stitch at all. I have wondered whether the failures are because some of the images are rotated 180 degrees, and ICE doesn't do that much work trying to find the matches.

Usually the first thing I do with a new set of mapping images is try to stitch some of them in ICE.  There is a comparison here <a href="http://fastie.net/?p=1241">http://fastie.net/?p=1241</a> of a map made in MapKnitter with a version stitched in ICE (with extra images added in Photoshop).  It would be really nice to submit stitched images like the ICE version to the PLOTS archive so they end up in Google Earth instead of the aligned but not blended versions from MapKnitter.
