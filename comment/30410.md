Environmental science is an interdisciplinary topic. 

Environmental science factors or things that or abiotic or biotic and things that it can have an impact on. 

The chemicals that affected the water was fuel. 

Worldometer- 7,967,873,964 

there are 779,897,324 people with an access to a safe drinking water source. 

Carcinogenic-refers to a substance that are cancer causing. 

The people at the camp were exposed too â€¦ kidney cancer, nervous system cancer, bladder cancer, blood, breast etc. 

Today I learned that the Clean Water Act known as the (CWA) has removed all the toxic substances from the water and to keep all the water clean. We need this act because dangerous chemicals can leak in our water and cause more cancer. Marines that resided in Camp Lejeune suffered from bad water effects because they drank safe water. It had a lot of carcinogenic harms
