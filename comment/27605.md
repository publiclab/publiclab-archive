Hi [@shmoo](/profile/shmoo), great to hear from you. Sorry to hear you are having these air quality impacts. Neighbor relationships and lifestyle differences are really hard. For sure. A question and then an idea: 
**Question:** do you mean Purple Air sensor? 
**Idea:** work in public to show how you are building the equipment with the blinky lights to your neighbors, and show how the smoke affects the lights. To the extent possible, go out of your way to relate differently to your neighbors to make this a project that builds a bridge instead of a project that generates battle argumentation neighbor-vs-neighbor. Bringing in authorities is likely to make them double-down instead of being open to behavioral change -- something that the council, who will not be setting up constant surveillance on your block, will not actually be able to achieve through any legal or enforcement action. 
Happy to keep brainstorming here with you.
