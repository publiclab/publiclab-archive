Just looping in [@ethanbass](/profile/ethanbass), [@ygstcu](/profile/ygstcu), [@matej](/profile/matej), & [@tonyc](/profile/tonyc) who were part of this discussion/design process, [@stevie](/profile/stevie) and [@gretchen](/profile/gretchen), and [@stoft](/profile/stoft) because of the possibilities I mentioned at the end about pairing this with a light sensor to try to get an absolute measurement of input light brightness, and possibilities re: absolute intensity calibration. What do you think?
