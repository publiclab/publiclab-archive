This is a rather broad question.  So let's try a different approach.  Go to the "search" key ( in my tablet, this is done by tapping the icon at the upper right corner, the search field will then appear in the upper left corner, enter " microscope" " enter" .  I got over 1500 responses).  Then read through the responses and we can go from there.  Good luck!
