There are test strips available for those, too. The more expensive ones are for testing drinking water.  The cheaper test strips are for testing fish tanks for water quality.  Check the on line services.  Again, this wouldn't do for any EPA type of work.  But if you are just trying to get a feel for how bad the local water is, they are probably ok.  Again, as long as there are no drastic pH variations from normal( coal strip mine ponds have had pHs of about 1 sometimes).
