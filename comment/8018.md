Finally, I got some interesting data.....BUT the results confuse me.  I am looking at algae in a petri dish placed between the light source and the spectrophotometer.  I then compare the results with water in a petri dish placed between the light source and spectrophotometer.  I expected the intensity of the algae at certain wavelength (like 400-450 and 650-700 as those are the wavelengths for chorophyll) to be reduced versus that of just plain water since I thought that's how adsorbtion spectroscopy works.  Increase in chorophyll and algae should correspond to lower intensity at those wavelengths associated with chorophyll, right?  However, I am seeing higher intensity in the spectra for the algae vs that of water.  What am I missing?  Any advice or help would be appreciated.
