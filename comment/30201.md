There are 3 in 1 flashlights ( blue, white, and red) that would be good for this application- as long as the color was more like purple instead of blue.  The flashlight would be able to switch between the ends of the spectrum, for each individual anaysis, as well as an overall scan.   Blue is something like 445 nm to 490 nm.  The area of chlorophyll peaks  needs is more like 415 nm to 435 nm.  ( if you down the standard ROYGBIV, this is indigo or violet).  Also looking for light bulbs filling this requirement.  There are a few.  Will keep looking.
