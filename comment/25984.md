The TPL5110 depends on getting a signal to the DONE pin, so I am not sure it can just send a pulse every eight seconds. The TPL5111 sets an enable pin high every interval (instead of turning power on every interval like the TPL5110), but it also requires a done signal to set the enable pin back to low. But if the microcontroller can send a DONE signal as soon as the enable pin is set to high, then the TPL5111 could work to send a pulse every eight seconds.
