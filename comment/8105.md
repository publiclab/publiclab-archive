Hey Chris thank you for the quick reply! , the photo looks great! , and you were right, i did not use white balance
I have the camera just with CHDK,,, can you point me some links on which are the best CHDK settings for NDVI ? I read that i need to use manual White balance with Dayligth settings, but IÂ´m sure that are many other things to set ( ISO, Focus, Raw... )

I'm using 1 layer of Rosco 2007 on the external side of the camera,,, it should be inside ? 

I'm planing to use 2 cameras, one for visible ligth and the other for NIR, on the NIR camera i have the rosco... to be honest if i order another filter i need to wait 2 months until the mail delivers the package to my house, we have a huge crisis in Argentina regarding shippings and packages from other countries.

Regarding the FPV video setup, I ask a friend to help me with the vvvv code to compile the images, he will give me an update soon... the good news is that we have CCD cameras with and without IR filer... i guess we will get 2 cameras without IR filter and add the spare filter that we have from the Canon one,.,,, i will keep this post updated on this topic.

Regarding Fiji... can you show me some tutorials regarding the steps to install the plugin and get the NDVI final results ?
