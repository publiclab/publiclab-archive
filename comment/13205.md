Martenskram, I am in Västerås, where in Sweden are you? We have birch, pines, firs, and some hardwoods like oak. I agree, moss has no problems covering the forest floor here, We had a big forest fire near here 2 summers ago, and the forest floor burned up, leaving just rocks. It looks very different than one would expect, and we are curious as to how recovery will proceed. Interesting project here.
