Directly onto plastic will get you a melted mess.  Put down silicone parchment paper (for baking cookies) and use an iron on top of that.   Use the tip or edge of the iron.  I have good luck using irons sideways.  If you need a protective surface underneath, try butcher paper.  I'd start by turning the iron all the way up, and pressing hard into the plastic. The straight-edge/form is just a guide.
