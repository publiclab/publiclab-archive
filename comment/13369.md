Update -- based on some tinkering, and some great [feedback](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plots-waterquality/jcTd0xAOwUY) from folks on the plots-waterquality google group:

The power issues no longer seem mysterious.  The first, primary issue, as described above, is:  I simply wired up the switch improperly, so that power wasn't reaching the microcontroller.  That is a simple fix.

The second, more interesting issue has to do with the lithium battery controller chip ("IC2", in the above schematics) on the board.  This chip -- the MCP73831 -- is designed to be connected to a power source on its "VIN" pin, and then on its "VBAT" pin, to be connected to both a lithium battery, and to a load.  It then does some fancy stuff to manage this power setup -- but it assumes that a battery is connected.  If no battery connected, its behavior is likely unpredictable -- it may or may not provide enough current to the load.  This is consistent with what I have seen recently, and in previous prototyping of this circuit -- when the battery is not present, but the board was plugged into USB power, sometimes the microcontroller would behave oddly (e.g. not allow for programming via the Arduino IDE).  

One simple solution, given the current circuit: always have a battery plugged in.  Given the current circuit setup (with appropriate fixes to the arrangement of pins on the switch, so that things are connected properly), this would mean that, in order to program the boards when plugged into USB, we'd always need to have either a lithium battery plugged into the lithium JST port, or some battery plugged into the "general" JST port -- and we'd need to make sure that the switch was in the appropriate position.  

This solution 'works' -- but it's less than ideal.  Given the way the UNO and most other hobby electronics boards behave, one expects to be able to program the device when power is provided via USB, and it's odd and a bit inconvenient to require a battery being present.  Also, the real purpose of the 'switch' has been to provide an 'on-off' functionality on the board, so that one can conserve battery power when the device isn't deployed.  Currently (again, with the proper wiring changes), the switch in the circuit effectively decides between the two battery sources ... which means that the effective "on" and "off" positions will be swapped, depending on which battery is plugged in.  One must be careful not to plug in more than one battery at once. 

All of this is an argument for a more intelligent power circuit.  

Brian Mayton yesterday suggested an alternative:

[![IMG_20160121_194239255_(1).jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/764/medium/IMG_20160121_194239255_%281%29.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/764/original/IMG_20160121_194239255_%281%29.jpg)

The idea:  we can provide the microcontroller (the open rectangle on the far right of the diagram) with power from *all three* sources -- USB (labeled "USB"), lithium battery (denoted by a battery symbol -- a few horizontal lines), and an alternative battery source "ALT" -- at the same time, and use diodes to select which power source is used.  The switch can then be put on the far right of the circuit, so that it truly operates as an "on/off" switch.  

Another reason to put diodes in the circuit this way:  it protects each of the power sources from being "charged" by the others, if multiple sources are plugged in.  This is important, and something I see now should've been done, anyway:  for example, if we're going to allow for a 'general chemistry' battery on one of the JST connectors, we would like to protect USB (at 5 V) from being overwhelmed by a >5V battery plugged into that JST connector.  A diode serves this function.  

So, I'm planning on implementing a new power circuit, as in the above diagram, using diodes as both protection and power management.  The only trick is to find diodes that have a relatively low forward voltage drop -- the amount of voltage lost when connecting across it. 

Last night I found a discussion of such diodes, here:

I'm going to sort through the datasheets this morning and see which ones might work best. 

Meanwhile, if anyone reading this has better ideas / any additional input, do drop a line! :)
