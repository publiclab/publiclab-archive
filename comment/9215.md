Did you ever get anywhere with this?  I've been trying to find a way to use a PiCam in a KAP rig but it was always too difficult to control in the field (where chances are, SSH command line wouldnt be an option...)  My idea was to build an touchscreen controllable RPi cam setup following the tutorial on Adafruit (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pitft-28-inch-resistive-touchscreen-display-raspberry-pi/overview) , so I could start the camera and the timelapse settings on the go.  Unfortunately the Adafruit tutorial assumes you will be connected to WiFi and saving the photos in Dropbox.  Its supposed to allow for a "standalone mode" but I can't seem to get it to work.  Has anybody else figured out how to control a PiCam in the field without simply powering it on and praying that the python auto-timelapse works?
