the cutter works great! I went through similar initial issues, setting the blade lower and not seeing it cut all the way through.  I settled on the "coverstock" setting which does a double cut, and have the blade set down to 5 for the 100lb paper.

for long objects i'm seeing some registration issues when cutting them perpendicular to the cutter, they need to be loaded parallel.
