Nice work. Can you do a spectrum of a low pressure sodium lamp? If you can, or cannot, resolve the doublet at 589nm you will have a better idea how high resolution your spectrometer is.

Also, rather than 3D-print your slit, try with a couple of razor-blades. You can easily get slit-widths lower than 200 Âµm. And while we're at the slit: What kind of magnification of the slit do you theoretically get with this setup, and what does that translate to, in terms of theoretical resolution?

Finally, is there a reason for not collimating the light from the slit, before it hits the grating. I'm thinking that uncollimated light will hit the grating at different angles, dispersing the same wavelength at different angles.
