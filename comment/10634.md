I've flown kites more than balloons. In my limited experience balloons don't pull like kites but I've never flown a balloon in a serous wind. In any case a good pair of gloves is a must. I use a pair of leather ones found at a welding supply store at reasonable price. They're much better than the others I've used. I don't have trouble with rope burn any more. 

I manage kites by hand and don't use a winder. Seems like winding directly to a spool creates an awful lot of tension, so maybe walking the kite down and spooling the slack once it's loose is better. At least that's my experience. I can't imagine using a power drill to reel in line.

I always use an 11" surveyor's stake hammered into ground to fix the kite down. In heavy wind I'll use two of these to help me walk the kite down. Lowe's sells them [here](http://www.lowes.com/pd_349251-258-GS11BK_4294612871__?productId=3462428&Ns=p_product_qty_sales_dollar|1&pl=1&currentURL=%3FNs%3Dp_product_qty_sales_dollar%7C1&facetInfo=). 



If the tension is too much I use something called a gamma hook. Actually I don't use the classic design, instead I use a large carabiner in the same way as a gamma hook. Honestly I don't know if I'm using it right but what I do with it seems to help.
