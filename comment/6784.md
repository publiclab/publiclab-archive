wow, good results jeff, as it happens, I'm about to do a similar test on some filters which we use for another experiment. It is rather important to get a narrow a band as possible from the filters and I've always suspected they are wider than desirable. LEDS are also an option for this experiment, so great to see the bandwidth comparison.
