We got really lucky with the sync. When I got home I found that both cameras were less than a second from the GPS time signal. I had set the camera clocks a few days ago, but it is just luck that they were that close. So the lat lon of my day pack is now written in each jpeg (whether the day pack shows up in the photo or not).
