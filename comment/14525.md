Good evening [@AFairbairn](/profile/AFairbairn) ,
I read with great interest your post because even I and my group are having the same difficulties to develop good NDVI images, especially comparable for different fields or different days.
We therefore ran into problems finding the target for the radiometric calibration of the cameras (we purchased from PaeuProduction 2 Mapir cameras: RED and NIR).
To be fair, thanks to the advice, the post, and the tutorial of [@NedHorning](/profile/NedHorning) and [@CFastie](/profile/CFastie) we were able to use the PhotoMonitoring plugin with good success.
I read in the [@Claytonb](/profile/Claytonb) comments of KOMATEX panels:
[@Claytonb](/profile/Claytonb) You tell me more about this material and if you managed to use it as a target radiometric ??
[@AFairbairn](/profile/AFairbairn) You managed to build a radiometric target economic and reliable ??
