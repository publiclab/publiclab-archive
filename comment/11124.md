Following my repeat experiment I have been thinking about the IR response of the PL spectrometer. I haven't been that concerned about it because it was not of immediate interest to me. I haven't tried removing the IR filters from any of the 3 spectrometers I have now built. However given the even more obvious attenuation of the low frequencies in my most recent plots I do wonder if the DVD-R dye would have quite a drastic effect on IR. Of course it might not, the dye might act as a notch filter and let the lower IR through, rather than as a high pass filter. I suspect though that it acts as the latter rather the former.
Matthew - does the camera shipping with the Spec 3.0 have the IR filter removed at the factory? Or is it still in there.
