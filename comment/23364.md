 I wish i knew! I know a lot of people that just pen and paper wrote down what they thought was significant every day. but now there are all these apps that might be able to do it better like https://www.sympleapp.com/ i haven't used it but i worry that you get into it and then maybe they charge you for something? i'm not sure of their biz model. but there are TONS of them.
