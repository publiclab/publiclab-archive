Hey [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) ! I was wondering how i could see a map with icons on it for people's usernames/locations? I can see the map that shows my pin on my profile, but I'm searching for people who have profiles from a specific place. Any ideas on how to do that? Is there a layer like the mapknitter one that shows profiles? Hope all is well :) :)
