Hi, i believe the CSV is set up with a space character instead of a new line: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/latest/251374.csv

If you do a find/replace of the file, you should be able to replace ' ' with a newline character (say, in TextEdit on a Mac, or even in Word) and save it again to open normally in Excel. Hope that works!
