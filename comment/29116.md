This has been our issue for years, as well. In the past, we rented Summa canisters and would open them, only to get low to null readings and the labs were very expensive. We are fortunate to have gas monitors to inform us when a bucket grab sample is worthwhile. We are trying to figure out what is in the air when there is an odor. Now I understand that without a strong odor present, the air grab sample is probably not worthwhile. 

The bucket tool from PL has been a great way to reduce our operating costs. We no longer rent Summas and are able to keep the buckets on hand in case we need to grab a sample.

In any case, I can commisserate. What are you monitoring?
