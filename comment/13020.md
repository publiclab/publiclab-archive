LaPa,

The custom white balance procedure you refer to works only for certain cameras. A year ago it was not possible to set a custom white balance on a Pi camera, and I have not heard that this had been implemented. So it might not be possible to set a custom white balance. That means it probably will not be possible to compute NDVI directly from the values in a photo taken with a Pi camera. It might be possible to adjust the values in the photo, but I have not had any success doing that with other cameras.

If you use two cameras, a Pi Camera and a Pi NoIR, custom white balance is not required.

Another approach will be to include calibration targets in the photo you take and use the new calibration capability of the Photo Monitoring plugin for Fiji to compute NDVI from your photos. 

There is a discussion related to this here: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-27-2011/video-tutorial-creating-false-color-ndvi-aerial-wetlands-imagery#c12966
