You can read about this on the [NPDES wiki here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/npdes#What+kinds+of+permits+and+limits+are+included+in+NPDES?). 

"There are two kinds of permits issued under NPDES: individual and general. Individual permits are issued for major point sources, such as a city’s wastewater treatment plant or a large industrial facility. General permits are issued for smaller, more common sources, such as city stormwater or industrial sources that are expected to discharge sufficiently low amounts so as not to disrupt a water body’s physical, chemical, or biological state."

You can research specific permits on the EPA website here: https://www3.epa.gov/enviro/facts/pcs-icis/search.html
