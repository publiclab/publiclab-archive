[@pdhixenbaugh](/profile/pdhixenbaugh) -- Good point!  I do think the self-discharge rate on these various battery chemistries does differ, but I don't know by how much. Let's dig up a reference ...

Meanwhile:  Here's the latest Riffle version, 0.1.8:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenWaterProject/riffle/master/hardware/riffle-beta-0.1.0/riffle-beta-0.1.8-schem.png

After a bunch of convos, this is the version we're thinking of locking in as a first release.

The main modifications recently have been to the power circuitry.  In the end, I think we came up with a nice solution:

[![power_0.1.8.png](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/893/medium/power_0.1.8.png)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/893/original/power_0.1.8.png)

The switch depicted has two positions.  In one position, it receives power from "VDD", which is connected to both VUSB and VBAT (the lithium battery port) via parallel diodes.  This way, the device is programmable when plugged into USB but when there's no battery plugged in (power gets routed from VUSB); if you plug in both, the battery gets charged.  

In the other position, the device receives power from "VGEN1".  This line is connected to two power terminals.  The first, CN1, is a JST connector.  We didn't place a diode on this line (no danger of plugging in a JST connector "backwards", given the polar design of the connector) -- so any battery on this line goes directly into the LDO. The second, JP1, is simply two "+/-" breakouts directly on the board.  This is for users who might want to make their own particular power connector.  This is protected by a diode; but we've also placed a solder jumper on the back of the board that allows advanced users to bypass this diode.

I think this gives us a pretty good solution.  For general prototyping and programming, one of the battery ports (CN1) is more appropriate.  For really long term deployments where you want to squeeze every last drop of energy from the battery, the other battery ports (CN2 or JP1) probably work best.  

For this version, we decided not to allow for routing around the LDO.  We're going to reserve that feature for a possible update later.  For most purposes, the LDO's quiescent power draw (1 uA for the MPC1700) shouldn't be an issue.  

Further changes:

- I added artwork to the back of the board that lists out all the 2x7 pins.  That's good :)
- I changed the wiring on the battery voltage measurement pin.  Before, it was only measuring the battery voltage.  Now, it's measuring "VIN" -- which, depending on the configuration, might be USB or one of the three battery ports.  Nice.

Please send any feedback or anything you notice re: errors -- but it looks like we're close to ready for a first release (exciting)!

Cheers,
