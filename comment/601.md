Just thought i'd respond in a comment instead of by email --

that's fantastic, thanks Chris. "well rested"... well, i will be tomorrow after a good night's sleep. 

Just so you know, i'm trying to work hard this week to ship the IR kits out, so I may be a little slow on working on the documentation until that's done. 

I'm particularly interested in doing some endurance testing of the system to see if it'll keep triggering for 30 minutes. I wouldn't want to ship this out without being sure it could handle a whole flight.
