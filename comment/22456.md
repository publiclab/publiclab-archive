Hi!  We tested hundreds of apps, published results in the Journal of Acoustical Society of America, if you'd like more information, check out our science blog http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2014/04/09/sound-apps/ for more info and links to studies.  In Summary, out of 192 Android and iOS apps we tested, only 4 iOS apps met our accuracy criteria.  Check the link above for a list of those apps. 

After those studies, we built our own app (NIOSH SLM), it's free and tested in our labs against a type 1 sound level meter.  https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/app.html.  

My recommendation is to use one of the 4 apps in the study or our own app.  For folks interested in making better noise measurements, we have been recommending the use of an external microphone that can be calibrated with acoustical calibrators.  You can find all such information in the links provided.
