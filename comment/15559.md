Thanks, Phil - I'm curious if Collins' analysis is widely recognized among scientists -- i.e. is this simply common knowledge, and replication is not widely considered to be an important process as science is practiced today, or is Collins' analysis that science practitioners today hold a flawed understanding of their systems of producing knowledge, and that there is a separate mechanism for the wide recognition and adoption of new ideas (perhaps, publication, instead of replication)?

Whether or not it is broadly recognized, I'm interested in it as a mechanism of evaluation for people sharing ideas on this site, because it gives authors a motivation to provide clear, thorough, and easy-to-follow steps, so that they *get* replications. This may sound obvious but I think many folks end up just writing about what they did, not setting out to guide others through the process. And by celebrating "replications" or whatever we call them, we make a "thing" out of doing something twice, or three times, which chips away at the cult of originality we see in some creative spaces -- the rush to "be the one to do something" and the lack of glamor in being second.
