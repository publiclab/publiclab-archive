To give a few more details, a general lab certification is a2la ( american association of lab accreditation).  Think that's right.  

There has been a push for globalization.  So instead of testing to each nations specifications, you would only test to one.  The general nomenclature for these is ISO tests. For example Iso 9001.  But they are expensive to get certified for.  So not all labs get them.

There are also individual test methods.  Does the lab test to the test method needed?  It should not be just a yes.  It should be a yes and we test to section or method .....

To make things worse, most universities don't have these certifications.  

Hopefully,  This gets you started.
