Thanks, Jeff! I think Naya was present at the barnraising session where this odor-mapping project was proposed and I believe my husband and Naya both worked on the hand-written template together, so getting Naya in on the conversation would be great.

(I have some research for Naya regarding low-cost and wearable pesticide test strips I need to send her way, too)
