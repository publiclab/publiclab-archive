 This is great, thanks for posting [@stevie](/profile/stevie)! I pinged in on the chatroom to hear from some of the folks who've been involved in facilitating the Weekly Check-Ins in our code community; although it's not the same thing as a weekly check-in, the process for inviting and supporting people to do the check-in could be a relevant point of reference for getting this process started -- 

Here's this week's check-in: https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues/1065

Here's the doc [@sashadev-sky](/profile/sashadev-sky) posted a while back to help people make their first Check-In: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/master/doc/CHECKINS.md
