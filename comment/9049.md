Nice! What kind of lens would it take to make a smartphone can work? I'm thinking about plastic or resin lenses... and portability, but probably jumping the gun. This is rad. 

If the background were green or something, we could chroma key out the background and the non silica... But maybe that's not possible as you'll need full spectrum light?
