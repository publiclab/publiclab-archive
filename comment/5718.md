Great talk, Stewart!

Bilco1, the Canon A495 (and many other Canon Powershot models) can take photos continuously by putting rubber bands over the shutter to hold it down (takes a photo about once a second). Many, including the A495, can also be used with Canon Hacker Development Kit (CHDK) and triggered by an intervalometer script or an externally timed trigger circuit, using USB remote. The approaches are described in the Tools portion of the Public Lab site and the research notes have lots of examples.
