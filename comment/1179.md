Very exciting, the work you're doing. On a suggestion by Chris F, I posted a brief description of what you're doing at the Pioneer Valley open science group's site since they are very interested in using Arduinos, and we have this prototype electronic H2S sensor. I'm hoping they'd be interested in working on an electronic prototype in parallel, so we could test various strategies and see if the data correlates:

Although really, testing with an off-the-shelf technique would give a better sense of if you're really detecting H2S, since this prototype electronic sensor is also not yet credible.
