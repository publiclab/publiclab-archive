I think that these instructions leave a lot of details "in the dark" and I have a lot of questions about mounting my own spectrometer (exact distance from entry slit to the webcam, explanations about what is "seen" by camera from the light entering flow, how to choose the exact position of the camera , etc.). For the moment   I did not find  lot of answers to my questions, but , as far as I am concerned, I have a small laser  which allows me to visualize the light ray from outside to the camera through the slit and I send it to the middle of the lenz.
