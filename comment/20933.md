Hi [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) - interesting! I know that folks have used IR cameras and NDVI imaging to identify algae blooms using aerial photography, but I have to admit I don't know a whole lot about the processes used to convert algae into oils-- my understanding is that processes are designed around particular kinds of algae, which are fine-tuned in a lab. We've started being able to ID algae with the community microscope, so it would be interesting to see if there is a way to combine the microscope and NDVI imaging to come up with a rubric for identifying particular kinds of algae blooms from a distance. 

Are you asking about the possibility of farming (sourcing?) from algae in the oceans for energy production as a means to help scale back harmful blooms? Either at a commercial scale, or something that could be DIY'd? Would be interested to hear a little more about what you're thinking!
