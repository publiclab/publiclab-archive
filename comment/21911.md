 Hi Corymbia – It’s nice to see some new work in this area. 

I see that you used the Adobe DNG converter. You might want to look into that to understand what processing is happening in the conversion. My understanding is that most converters do not produce a direct or minimally processed conversion. I used the dcraw program since it produces an image that is closest to the raw pixels values. It might not be an issue but could be worth checking out. 

Getting the reflectance data from the red tile could provide some insight into the results you’ve been getting. I have no idea what the IR reflectance is for tile but from your image 1 photo it doesn’t look like the IR % reflectance is nearly as high as the red paper I was using. 

I’m not sure if you can change this but I was not able to view your tables.

I look forward to seeing a note using calibrated RAW data.  Keep up the good work.
