I will no longer be posting my research here at Plab, now or in the future, my reasons are simple, I work very hard at what I do and what I am trying to accomplish, I work every single day at this, because I am retired and I enjoy it, what I do NOT enjoy is 1) censorship of conversation and thought. 2) There is a lack of real leadership here and it manifests itself by a real lack of focus and attention to the individuals who do put in a lot of hard work in contributions here, there is a "clicky" type atmosphere going on here that I do not appreciate, i.e., seems like the only "real" science going on here is tying a string to a balloon and sending up a camera to take some topographical pictures?

There is no reason in my opinion, to even bother with spectral workbench 2, when it's potential is begin wasted on lamp light. I have pointed out before in my research, that one cannot do absorption spectroscopy using spectral workbench because the "leadership" is not really concerned doing the real science of this craft, but only the topical aspect of it, perhaps only for the reason of a selling point for a more marketable cellphone toy (hence; Desktop spectrometer 3.0.) The "leadership" should be more forthright with newcomers in communicating the true intentions of Plab, which again, is just my opinion and observations, that this is more, just an environmental advocacy and activism organization than a scientific one.
