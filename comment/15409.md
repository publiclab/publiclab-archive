The size of the 'square' parts is close to 0.5-in but the "ideal" value is set by the "height" of the camera lens after the camera is mounted. The dimension should be the same as the camera lens "height" or slightly higher -- as the double-stick tape to hold the DVD will add a small clearance. If, the mounted camera height were 0.5-in then the 'square' support dimension would be 0.5 -0.0 +0.125 . I'll add a note above.
