If you're at all interested in reflectance measurements, I posted a sketch for a reflectance setup here that might interest you: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/04-21-2016/prototype-of-easy-to-build-rigid-spectrometer-housing#c14412

I probably won't have time to try it out but tell me if you do!
