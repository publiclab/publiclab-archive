Yeah, the idea that since plants have large NIR reflectivity, shown in both R and B, and since we're just subtracting. So if B is 2x R, a pixel with `R=2` gets `B=4` compared with a pixel with `R=5` which gets `B=10`. It's multiplicative. 

How could we prove that hypothesis wrong? We'd have to divide rather than subtract, so that the differences are proportional. Then any differences remaining would have to be due to the materials in the scene, right?

Here's `R/B` - which shows that the relationship is not linear:

I think that's not bad evidence. Please help poke a hole in this theory too, Chris!!! Mathew is also going to take a lot of test photos using the Mobius (with this new technique) and a Infrablue Canon and the Infragram Webcam this week.
