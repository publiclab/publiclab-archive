Excellent [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)!</br>
Another option a lot more techie but, if not only for this temporal use, would be installing Spectralworkbench on a local server maybe using Mamp/Xampp (?¿)</br>
It requires some skills but if someone close to you [@dhale2](/profile/dhale2) knows how to manage a server you would have your own offline tool with all that implies (not dependence on the bandwith for the video transfer, just one user, etc...) In fact now that I'm writing I think I'll give it a try maybe using a raspberry pi (?¿?¿)</br>
