Chris - If you are referring to JPEG images acquired using one of the camera's internal white balance settings then I don't think the histograms for the different channels are telling us much since we have no idea how the images were adjusted by the camera. I expect those histograms are whacked out during the processing so I don't think we can use those as a reference. The image we see isn't what the sensor (with the Bayer filter) sees and in some most cases it's not even close. The images are processed to adjust for a number of factors so the image better resembles reality.

There is definitely some  visible light leaking through the film filters but I'm not sure how significant it is. It would be nice to put some number on that. When I hold the film up to a light I can see the light but it's very dim. When I hold a glass IR 850 filter to the light I don't see any light come through. 

We should have a meet-up to test some of these things. I have three filters now, two professionally installed, and there are some simple tests we could run to better understand what's going on and what it means from a practical standpoint. I'll also step up my effort on the calibrate side of things.
