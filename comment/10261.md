I also tried using a reflective metallic surface behind the cuvette to make the fluorescence brighter:

It was hard to see, naked eye or by camera, any difference. In part, this is because the laser travels through sample material and gets dimmer the further along the beam path it goes. So I bracketed the cuvette with reflective tape with two cuvettes without it:

However, you can see in the middle cuvette, there's a big dropoff in brightness where the reflective material ends:

So I cut a narrower strip of reflective material, and used a Canon camera to do a very low exposure test. It does seem to increase brightness quite a bit!

I think next step would be a test in a spectrometer, to see if, say, with the SYBA cam above, how high we can get the brightness vs. an un-modified cuvette. The reflective material could go behind the container, too, BTW -- it prob. wouldn't have to be adhered directly.
