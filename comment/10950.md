This is a really good collection of information about photosynthesis and spectral analysis.

My understanding was that NDVI has largely been used for wide area scanning, but it isn't so useful at a per-plant level. However, in a controlled environment (such as an indoor aeroponics station or a small garden at night), per plant analysis might be possible by trying controlled experiments to separately judge reflectance+transmittance, phosphorescence, and heat; that leaves photosynthesis as the free variable. It might take a bit more than a single camera and a single light source for such a battery of tests though. If we figure out how to do those tests by hand, the next step is to automate it.

Btw, some of the information and graphics have linked sources, others do not. It'd be great if all the sources could be filled in.
