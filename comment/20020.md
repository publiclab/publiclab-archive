Your Guvcview control panel looks much like mine running on a real Ubuntu PC (If I understand you correctly you are running it in a virtual machine). Camera settings persist after I close Guvcview. Not sure why you mention auto-focus, you don't want it and I'm pretty sure the camera that ships with the spectrometer doesn't have it. Spectral workbench and /or the browser can be very picky about accessing the camera. When you run Guvcview do you see a spectral image in the viewing window? If not something is wrong with your slit or your diffraction grating.
