This is an issue with the instructions highlighted by [@stevie](/profile/stevie) -- your spectra are well calibrated and the 435/546 [#s](/tag/s) refer to the nanometer positions the lines should have *after* you calibrate. We're working on a better wording there -- maybe:

"Before calibrating, the horizontal axis lists the pixel position along the spectrum. After you calibrate and save, the B2 and G2 lines should appear at 435 and 546 nanometers, respectively, if you're aligned well with the reference spectrum."

What do you think?

Another note -- you should upload without cropping because the calibration needs to be at the same image size and proportions as any later spectrum, so that the calibration will be transferable.
