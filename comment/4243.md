Awesome!  Yes, actually one of the reasons we're going with the Teensy is precisely because of Paul.  I've never met him but I've never seen a single individual put so much support behind a single product as he has on his forum, and he's prolific in adding features and responding to users.

Thanks for the confirmation that we're not crazy :)
