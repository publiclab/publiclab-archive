Thanks for posting! Just adding in some text and a link I gathered from a chat with [@ChristianWagley](/profile/ChristianWagley) "Every time we have heavy rain the bayou turns red from red clay from dirt roads and road construction upstream (north) channeled to the bayou through ditches and a constrained natural creek."

Also, a Pensacola News Journal article with good drone footage of area:
