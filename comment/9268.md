Cool!  you can also grab graphics from our [guides](/wiki/guides) if that's helpful.

one note on the balloon connection-- the camera is more stable if you attach it's 10' line directly to the balloon and not below the balloon on the control line.

just ask if you need more graphics or data on the spill-- I'll be following this note.
