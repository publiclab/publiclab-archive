Hey Stevie -- was thinking about how to refine this question for a specific use case, and came across this post by [@tonyc](/profile/tonyc): https://publiclab.org/notes/tonyc/07-07-2016/design-specifications-for-field-camera#My+attempt+and+results

He proposed a set of specs like this: 

* should be waterproof, able to survive inclimate weather.
* should be able to record photos at 10 minute intervals for minimum of 30 days without recharge.
* should be able to have data removed and battery replaced/recharged in the field by a non-technical user.
* should be able to be mounted to a variety of bases, in urban and natural environments.
* should be of a minimum of 8MP resolution.
* should have total BOM cost of less than $100.
* should provide accurate time stamp or ability to determine time/date for every photo

I think the Crenova (which we tested, and listed in an earlier comment) fits all of these, actually! It actually also has a temperature mark next to the timestamp in each picture, which is cool.
