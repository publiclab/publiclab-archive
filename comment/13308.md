[@liz](/profile/liz), I have had the same experience with positioning & repositioning the cuvette. In addition, I also cut a bigger opening in the cuvette holder in order to get the fluorescing light shining through spectroscope slot. (picture of cut attached)

Experimenting with fixes with the cuvette holder, the best work-around for now has been a coke bottle cap with an X of 2-sided tape. By placing the cap in the corner, and centering the X, placement was easier, and the cuvette was upright, perpendicular, more reliably. It's a makeshift work-around from the weekend. Tape needed replacing after multiple uses.
