The usual way to solve the ammonium nitrate problem is to form a complex (that does absorb in the visible) and analyze the complex.  Off the top of my head, this seems like a reasonable approach.  But then again, I've done no investigation.

We did some work with developing a quick replacement for a lab analyzer. Please do not misunderstand.  I did not program.  But worked with the programmers.  the program was dropped.  Oh well.
