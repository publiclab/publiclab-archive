I am glad you raised the question of how the distance to the slit could affect how much the light was bent when it hit the diffraction grating. This would probably be a great high school physics puzzle in the hands of a capable teacher. Which I am not because my first instinct was to conclude that the photons must be aware of how far they have come from the slit.  Photons must be able to remember stuff! So the first lesson is that diffraction is a phenomenon of waves, not particles. I suspect that you are correct that the absence of a collimating element is allowing waves from multiple directions to arrive at the grating and have some influence on this effect.  My technique for determining maximum sharpness is to view the same two terbium lines in the CFL spectrum, so I am keeping wavelength constant in the process.  Still inscrutable.
