Hi, Ankur - 

> A) Resolution of the pattern is better

What is your hoped-for resolution? Can you link to your actual data on SpectralWorkbench.org so we can take a look? One way to determine what resolution you're getting is to look at a fluorescent (CFL) lightbulb spectrum. [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) has published a couple notes on very high resolution mods of the basic PL spectrometer design -- and his suggestions were used to dramatically improve the v3.0 spectrometer:

> B) No overexposure in certain regions of the spectrum

You can use an attenuator, as [@stoft](/profile/stoft) has described: http://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/05-14-2013/in-search-of-spectrometer-attenuators - and also see his other research for gain correction and a proposal for HDR exposure correction. 

> C) No Blurring of the spectrum image

I think this is related to the first issue, but if there's a separate issue, can you elaborate?

Thanks for your input, Ankur! As with Chris Fastie's and Dave Stoft's suggestions, any improvements you can propose will be considered in upcoming revisions of the spectrometer kit design. We need all the input we can get -- that's how open source design works!
