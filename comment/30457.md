The Clean Water Act was passed in 1972. It affected many homes and families that lived on the base of Camp Lejeune. The people who set arrangements knew about the toxic chemicals in the air and water and still chose to let people in to live there. So, the Toxic Substance Act was passed in 1976. This led to families contracted diseases such as cancer and other chemicals of the carcinogenic groups
