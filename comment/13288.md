> large yogurt container

Love this idea for standardization; used yogurt containers pile up quickly in my house. Or a mason jar! I'd guess material can have some effect too -- i.e. don't use a metal saucepan or something? And it'd have to be in the center of the container, so i guess somehow sticking it through a hole at the center of the lid or something? 

I agree that empirical testing is the way to go to determine these effects. You don't want to be spending time optimizing unnecessarily. Maybe a "grid" experiment where you have a row of vessels, and a series of probe geometries, and you test each probe in each vessel, like we did with the [Infragram filter/webcam tests](/notes/warren/09-13-2013/leaffest-infragram-camboard-batch-tests) back at an early LEAFFEST?

Maybe this list of references could be copied into the bottom of the [Coqui page](/wiki/coqui) so it's easier to find, as has been done on the [Oil Testing Kit Literature page](/wiki/oil-testing-kit-literature).
