Except ..... there is a real advantage of using the "yellow" "woodworkers glue", rather than white glue. "White glue" seems to be sold in different 'densities' (or so I've noticed) so I see that as an issue. More important, however, is the advantage of the woodworking glue (I used Elmers, nothing special) which is thick and sets-up very quickly -- literally within 30-60 sec with wood (which absorbs some of the moisture quickly) so that the parts won't keep "drifting" around after placement --- a real frustration for many. I admit, I've not investigated buying small quantities, but you might be able to buy small empty tubes or bottles and just provide small amounts from a larger supply. Sorry, but I don't think that common white glue is a good option.
