The Google group is completely separate from this web site, so the two places have somewhat independent conversations. I guess the Google group is seen by more people, so the feedback can be better there.

Research notes are a good way to share things with rich media and they are fairly easy to find later on. The Google group might be a better place to have conversations, mostly because more people might participate.
