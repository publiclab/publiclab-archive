Hi [@WaterGeek](/profile/WaterGeek), great to hear from the https://www.mytapwater.org/ project! There are many various water testing projects happening around here, but for the translated version of this one, see https://publiclab.org/wiki/knowflow which has DIY instructions in English and Chinese, and a place to ask questions and read already answered FAQs. Looking forward to your next post!
