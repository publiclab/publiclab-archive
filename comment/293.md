Wow, this is great! I guess many of our coastal images are not topographically interesting... but i do wonder what this process would look like with our mining site data:

http://publiclaboratory.org/map/marsh-fork-elementary-coal-river-west-virginia/2010-6-1

we have to dig around to find the raw images for that site.
