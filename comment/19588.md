Hi, all - just checking in with the 4 points I made during the call (some will be repetitive, sorry!):

1. Create planning issues -- with a checklist! -- from your proposals -- [read more here](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-18-2018/software-outreach-modularity-is-great-for-collaboration) to help coordinate your work with others
2. Try creating a `first-timers-only` issue from one of your checklist items -- [learn more here](https://publiclab.github.io/community-toolbox/#r=all) -- to bring other people into your project, and slowly build a team over the course of the summer
3. Use CodeClimate to find suggestions on how to make your code more readable and maintainable
4. Talk to each other! Don't get stuck - ask for help; we're all here to help each other out. Use the [chatroom](http://publiclab.org/chat), post an issue, and also remember to offer help (like reviewing PRs, troubleshooting) to each other and to newcomers.

It was great seeing you all -- thanks and get ready for a great summer!
