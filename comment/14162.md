Hi Chris, you said "consumer cameras don't have yellow sensors". All the modern cameras I know just have the RGB sensors. I wonder if we would get a much more correct spectrum if we wouldn't use any colour sensors at all but only intensity sensors at the different places where the photons arrive. Photon counters, so to speak. A much finer grating or prism to get a wider spread-out spectrum and a range of photon counters spread over the whole range. Is that how they do it in precision spectrometry? 

BTW, I wondered why I did not see any hint of Fraunhofer-lines in the sun spectra I have taken, but I guess that low-cost setup is just not precise (and widespread) enough to see them. I think the PLab spectrometer really has its strengths when it comes to emission spectra like in environment pollution testing, not so much when its about absorption spectra. Right?
