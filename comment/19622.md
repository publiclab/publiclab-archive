>  Hi, this is first test of the chat in chatroom.  I was wondering if there is any preference for Open CV python virtual environment vs a non virtual environment.  I understand the virtual environment helps multiple programs use the same libraries but it also seems  like another rthing to go wrong.   Also, AmirberAgain is not listed in the chat name 

HI [@MaggPi](/profile/MaggPi)
With regard to Python virtual environments you shouldn't worry about the they are a convenience for the developer but make no difference on the actual code. They exist so that you can mix and match library versions without messing with your operating system's Python. For our purposes it's fine to use the system's Python interpreter and libraries. You can install libraries as your current user with `pip install --user library`.

If your program uses external libraries be sure to create a `requirements.txt` file.

Also on IRC - some of us leave bots but are not at the keyboard. It's a way to get a backlog when we come back. A similar functionality is provided by Matrix.Org/Riot.im - it's good to leave your question and stick around until somebody answers! Github issues are also good for open discussion.
