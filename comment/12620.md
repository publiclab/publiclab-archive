Here is a text file with the 14 peaks I used to calibrate the CFL spectrum (in nm):

Here is a csv file of the intensity at each wavelength of the calibrated (3rd order polynomial) CFL spectrum:

Here is a jpg image of the calibrated diffraction pattern of the Snowy Sky CFL spectrum (the emission lines are where they should be according to [this source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fluorescent_lighting_spectrum_peaks_labelled.svg)):

I think the jpeg has the dimensions you requested.

The slider is definitely a little jerky, but it does not affect the function very much.
