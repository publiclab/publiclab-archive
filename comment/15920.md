you probably also want to reference https://www.regulations.gov/ which is the federal government's one stop site for reading rule-makings and commenting online.

the https://www.federalregister.gov/ is another great resource and published every business day.  It varies greatly but I can usually find things easier in the FR, which also lets you set email alerts by topic, etc.  And then once you find the proposal or whatnot, click the link to go to regulations.gov which will have the background docs, comments and various methods to upload your comments.

coincidentally, EPA updated the procedure states need to follow to update permits just recently:
