This is great.  Using absorbent materials to concentrate aquatic contaminants for analysis has a good, long history and the next step -- extracting sample from that absorbent material without altering the composition of the sample -- is the challenge.  I'm glad to see work being conducted on this, as it could be applicable to a range of contaminants, from optical brighteners to aquatic oil sheens to pesticides...  Good stuff!
