Here's another reference, although quite comprehensive: Page 14 of this [UNICEF guide](https://www.unicef.org/csr/files/UNICEF_Childrens_Online_Privacy_and_Freedom_of_Expression(1).pdf)

1. Children have the right to privacy and the protection
of their personal data.
2. Children have the right to freedom of expression
and access to information from a diversity of sources.
3. Children have the right not to be subjected to attacks
on their reputation.
4. Childrenâ€™s privacy and freedom of expression should be
protected and respected in accordance with their evolving
capacities.
5. Children have the right to access remedies for violations
and abuses of their rights to privacy and free expression,
and attacks on their reputation.
