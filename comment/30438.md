There are approximately 7,968,543,540 people in the world. Overpopulation can play a key role in why there are a wide number of deaths this year. Some people cannot afford healthcare, which could also lend a hand as to why there are the number of deaths this year. There is a wide range of death from diseases. These people may have not be able to afford the proper care in order to survive. There are approximately 863,056,566 people that are malnourished and 10,063 people that have died from hunger today alone. The population is growing continuously every second. There are approximately 127,170 births today and 88,384,660 births this year. Every second there are 2-3 births which adds onto the population. More people are born even second compared to the people that die. This makes some resources slim, which can directly cause hunger, thirst, and death.
