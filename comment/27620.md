[@deeptalaxmibharadwaj](/profile/deeptalaxmibharadwaj) wow! Thanks for documenting your concerns and showing the Public Lab community your process. I love that you went outside your community to collect lotus leaf too! Always great to get outside. I hope you continue to work on your ideas and share them here. I'd recommend starting a project page, learn more here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/projects
