Excellent progress. Everything looks good. The Picavet shaft should be tight so it does not slip. Once it is in place, there is not much reason to slide it around. But the shaft should spin easily in the two holes through the upper frame.

The gear spacing looks good. It seems to be not that critical. As long as it not so loose as to skip past teeth or too tight so that it locks, it should be fine. 

The one tricky thing remaining is attaching the white nylon round spline bracket to the camera tray. Use two of the five shiny M2 bolts with nuts. You have to enlarge two opposite holes in the nylon, then drill matching holes in the tray (above and below the center hole, not left and right). The bolt heads should be on the nylon side. Thread locker is good here. The one remaining shiny M2 bolt with washer goes into the end of the servo spline to hold everything together. That will have to be loosened to calibrate the tray angle (with the controller running) so there is no reason to tighten it too much. But eventually, it has to be tightened carefully because it is the only thing holding that side of the tray on.

Then the soldering part. 

Thanks for the progress updates.
