How can we, as individuals, reverse climate change? 
It’s actually pretty simple. 

I’ll set up an interesting scenario, and no, planting trees or going vegan is not a solution. 

Our polar ice caps are melting at an alarming rate. Last month, in July 2020, Canada lost 40% of its last intact ice shelf in just two days alone. TWO. We live in a closed system, our atmosphere, where our lives depend on a perfect and sustainable energy balance to perfectly sustain human life. This balance is clearly out of sync. Pandemics are just one example of this imbalance.

Once polar ice caps melt, and methane gas is released from the permafrost, runaway climate change is not just likely, but inevitable. 

The solution is simple and within our reach.
Its called Iceberg Reclamation and it's not as crazy as it sounds.

We can regenerate our ice caps and ice-covered land masses by collecting smaller icebergs that have broken off a larger ice shelf or iceberg, melting it down, and pumping it back onto the ice shelves. 

This is a two-fold solution: first, it prevents a rise in sea levels, by preventing the fresh water from melting into the ocean. Second, it manually regenerates our ice caps to prevent runaway climate change. 

Of course, this can only be done prior to runaway climate change, which scientists have predicted will happen by 2024, just 4 years from now.

So write your leaders, MLAs, MPs, Congress, Senate...wherever you are in the world, and fight to reverse and save our planet.

At the end of the day, in our fight against climate change, regenerating and reclaiming our icebergs should be our top priority.
