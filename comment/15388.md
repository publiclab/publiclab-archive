I'd like to put some screw holes in the side so you can attach things more easily, and a hole in the side so you can shine a light in without needing to cut into the acrylic more. 

Acrylic isn't that expensive, but masonite could be even cheaper. I think the main expense is actually the cutting. But two layers of corrugated cardboard glued together might be enough -- it really depends on what you consider to be "strong enough" and if you need water resistance too. 

This basic design is also pretty easy to modify in dimensions, using longer bolts, and by moving the screw tabs apart to make space for wider stock.
