You learn to accept many environmental issues.  The color of metal chelates in stream from a storm water discharge has a certain charm, but it still doesn't look good.  Similarly, a large level of human discharge in a storm sewer ( from overflow) just doesn't carry the same level of " je ne sais quoi" that fresh water does. Some of these have been corrected, but new ones will come up.
