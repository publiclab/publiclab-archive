The weather station we have does let you plug in new sensors - the issue would be that it wouldn't display on the display - as that is limited to working with the seonsors the kit you buy to begin with. That said thouh, the data will appear alongside the data from the other modules when you go into the software on your PC.  Also, some additional sensors come with their own displays (off the top of my head I seem to remember a UV Sunlight sensor doing this).
Weatherunderground.com does a good job of integrating data.
Also, I just happen to have one of these babies: http://www.netatmo.com - you can get their weather station with different modules to attach to it - in particular there is a particle sensor that can be added onto this as an additional unit. The outdoor module just does the same as a basic weather station & calibrates itself via the web. The indoor sensor is pretty interesting though - it tells you much CO2 is in your house  - we ended up getting plants after realising our indoor CO2 levels were way too high (1000ppm which worsens respiratory conditions such as asthma). Yo should check it out.
