Tom, I'm glad you asked. The proper Excel expression for choosing the greatest among three values did not come to me quickly, so I just used the equivalent of: if(red>green,red,green) for the part of the spectrum where blue was always close to zero and a similar expression for where red was always close to zero. If anyone knows a single Excel expression that will always choose the greatest of three values, please let us know.
