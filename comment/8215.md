willie, that is really cool.  i would do the same thing for new orleans--what about a stormwater tag?

I would be interested in a go pro picavet.  Liz, wasn't there a cheap particle board picavet design floating around?

mapping with a go pro is a no go, but it's very useful for targeting the "real" camera --i use Canon A490s and Canon 1400.

Especially with kite mapping (vs balloon mapping), it's difficult to learn where the camera actually is.
