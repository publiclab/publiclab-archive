***This note is a GSOC Phase 2 summary and updates Phase 3 goals.***


***Image Sequencer Manual***
Substantial changes to the manual were made over this rating period.   Proposed future changes for the next period include: 
-Adding new modules such as Noise reduction, Minify Image, blob Analysis, colorimetry
-Demonstration of Insert step functionality 
-Increasing the applications section to include blob detection and colorimetry
-Adding an intro section which list modules according to their general functions;  such as color modification, size or shape changes, text/QR,etc.  (This approach may help develop submenus vs the current 40 long  dropdown list) .

Initial announcement: 
https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/06-10-2019/draft-of-public-lab-image-sequencer-user-manual-comments-welcome
Manual Version 0.3:  https://github.com/MargaretAN9/GSOC-2019/blob/master/ImageSequencerUserManual.md#saturation-module


***IS/OpenCV***
Demonstrated the ability to load opencv and then process images from datauri to  string format and then to rgba.   Have not been able to successfully transfer image from rgba back into IS datauri display format.   At this point, aashna27  great work has superseded my efforts and it’s probably best to align with her designs.  My initial code trying to develop IS/openCV in a single file is available at : https://github.com/MargaretAN9/GSOC-2019/tree/master/is%20w%20opencv
Once opencv is pushed,  several new options exist for IS modules. One possible option is a calibration module for microscope pictures which measure a known reference and provide data for the grid module.     
Additional work includes a post demonstrating VS Code as an operating environment for OpenCV.js:

***Satellite Processing***
Steady progress using python to load and display satellite images (Landsat or Planet).   I was hoping to develop a request to only download a portion vs the entire image.   Comments from Planet.com indicate that this is not possible.  The current approach  is to use API’s to select thumbnail areas of interest, download geoTIFF files and then use gdal to crop images for easier processing.   
  
Currently working  an application which uses satellite imagery  to update OSM data with environmental characteristics.   This [Mapknitter link](https://mapknitter.org/maps/shades-of-green-overlay-of-nottingham-parks)  demonstrates how [overpass-turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) can be used to identify park areas  in satellite images, which then can then be processed to update OSM markings.   Code available at: https://github.com/MargaretAN9/GSOC-2019/edit/master/sattelliteImageProcess/greenOperpassExV1.ipynb


Collaboration efforts include Q/A’s to anaconda, opencv, planet.com  and IS github sites.
