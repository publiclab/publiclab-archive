[@rockets](/profile/rockets) Yes! that is exactly what I was concerned about. I'm too new at this to figure out what's an intelligent Uno question. I think a fundamental bit of confusion I had related to the difference between the voltage in at the barrel plug and the voltage in at the mini-USB.  This is my understanding: the barrel plug requires greater than 5V since the power is conditioned down to 5V. If it is exactly 5V, the Uno ends up being underpowered. The micro-USB takes in exactly 5V since that is the established standard, controlled voltage from a traditional USB port on a computer.  My question is really: can I use a 5V power pack on the barrel connection.  It seems that you think it's okay. Which is perfect for my application so I hope that it is correct.  

I'm trying a bunch of combinations. I purchased a Standard USB to barrel cable to test using an iPhone-type power pack.  I also purchased the same 7.4V power pack and charger that [@shanlter](/profile/shanlter) used (per pictures).  [I sell blacksmithing items to finance my Watershed Reclamation efforts - had a good chunk of sales over 4th of July so I'm splurging a bit on stuff.]

No problem with you putting the notes in the FAQ. Very much appreciated.
