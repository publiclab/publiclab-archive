Hi, Ujitha -- thanks for your update -- your project's been really exciting to see, with vast behind-the-scenes changes for a function (search) which has long needed a thorough revamp. I appreciate your effort in bringing the power of Solr/Sunspot to plots2, while putting extra effort into making Solr installation easy for new coders. Very excited to see so much of your work now live on the site, and eager to get the remaining stuff merged, which I'm very optimistic about! 

Thanks; it's been great working with you and I hope to do more together!
