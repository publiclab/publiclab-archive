[@btbonval](/profile/btbonval) we are using an analog detection method to avoid the pitfalls of digital calibration. The tubes are sealed in the lab and read on the spot after a know amount of air is passed trough them. They have a reasonably high upper limit on them and (I believe, I'm on the road now with only my small device) if we reach our upper limit we can run the test for one third the time and multiply the result by 4 to be able to quantify even higher levels. But if we do get results that high, I think I would rather people just get out of there rather than take another sample. We do have some chemicals that could cross contaminate and make hcho results artificially higher or lower--getting a list a factors that could lead to the presence of these other contaminants would make or method stronger. Gretchen and I will be doing some field tests with the RI dept of health to validate and see about cross contaminants and the tubes themselves have already been validated in a labrotory setting.  You are right that we need to worry about speciation. I think other Chem interferences is the final thing we need to do.
