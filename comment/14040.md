Writing tests for javascript is really nice idea. I heard a lot about jasmine and getting familiar with it. UI is some thing we need to care a lot. I made a rough UI design for the dropdown and forms. Will update in the proposal. 

`user_tags_controller` contains the API level endpoints for the tag data received. Definitely we will have a generic API for add_tag(). 

I will include tagging for autocomplete in the note section if project completes quickly :) (This is a easy task once we have tagging done)

Regarding "Achievements and skills" idea, I'm thinking of having a reputation score with a formula which is typically based on the tags and skills achieved by user. Representing graph can be done through D3 or highcharts. I'm familiar with highcharts, as data is going to be static we can go with highcharts. If you prefer D3 we can go ahead with it.
