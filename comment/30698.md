Plants get most of their nitrogen from the soil or water in which they live. Animals get the nitrogen they need by eating plants. Nitrogen enters soil on land or into ocean water when organisms die. 
Nitrogen is important because it is a major component of chlorophyll, the compound that plants use to make sugars from water and carbon dioxide. It's a major component of the building blocks of the human body. Plants wither and die. 
All animals need Nitrogen to grow, reproduce and survive. Nitrogen is converted into compounds that plants and animals can use. 
Nitrogen is important to plants and animals 
Plants and animals need Nitrogen because it is the major component of many vitamins and hormones. Nitrogen is required for the growth and development of plants and animals. 
Too little nitrogen and plants cannot thrive, leading to low crop yields, but too much nitrogen can be toxic to plants.
