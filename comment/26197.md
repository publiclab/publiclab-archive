Hi [@jenjimah](/profile/jenjimah), thank you so much for sharing your work. I have a question, did this final assembly manage to get the functionalities you set out to achieve? 

Like the range, resolution of (1-2nm) etc. 

I'm really inspired and would like to create a IoT handheld spectrometer using the same camera, but with 3D printing instead of using lego. 

Thanks!
