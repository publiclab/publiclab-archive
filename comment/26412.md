Hi, no worries, we can help you here. Is this the spectrometer you built?  https://publiclab.org/wiki/papercraft-spectrometer  or did you build one with a camera and cord inside? 

If you built the one with the link I just shared, there are a bunch of activities on that page. You won't need an app, just use your phone camera. Later you can upload the images to spectralworkbench.org to graph them.
