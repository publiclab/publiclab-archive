Thanks! [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996)

Yeah sure. I can create `first-timer-only` issues for the tasks which I plan to do in later weeks, so that I can keep up with the timeline without blocking myself and along with that engage new contributors with tasks which I plan to do later on.
