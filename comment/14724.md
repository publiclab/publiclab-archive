Well. I just used <pre and <code tags to wrap the code in, and that worked. 
would also be super cool to be able to embed Gists i
n a post. 

There is a bug in the code that I'm going to fix now where it doesn't roll over past midnight. I'll update the github repo. 
[@liz](/profile/liz): Thank for noticing!
