Just tried it and it is important to note that what you will see is 3 dots once the laser beam has passed through the diffraction grating. One is where the beam passes straight through and then there are two diffracted beams one below the main beam and one above. And you can see the direction of the track / lines on a DVD by just reflecting some daylight off it. You will see a reflected spectrum at right angles to the lines. I'd assume the same was true for any diffraction grating. But note that the diffraction angle is dependant on the LPI of the grating. If you are using a piece of commercial grating that is not as fine as a DVD the light may not be bending far enough to hit the camera.
