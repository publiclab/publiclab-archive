Hi Matthew,

Thanks!  Have you found any additional filter wheels worth considering since making your post?

Just a thought: if you *started* with a security camera that had one of the filter switchers as your base camera, then it might go more easily as you wouldn't have to worry about how to bolt one on after-the-fact.
