I'm not sure if this is the kind of information that would be helpful, but the DEC in New York State keeps a database of holes and wells ([https://www.dec.ny.gov/cfmx/extapps/GasOil/search/wells/index.cfm](https://www.dec.ny.gov/cfmx/extapps/GasOil/search/wells/index.cfm)) , which isn't precisely a cave database, but does point to the kinds of things can contribute to sinkholes.

It looks like there's also a sinkhole reporting form for Wisconsin here (these folks seem interested in karst and groundwater): [https://wgnhs.uwex.edu/water-environment/karst-sinkholes/](https://wgnhs.uwex.edu/water-environment/karst-sinkholes/), and a downloadable list of caves in Wisconsin from a 1980 survey here: [https://wgnhs.uwex.edu/pubs/000726/](https://wgnhs.uwex.edu/pubs/000726/). It's not a map or a database, but locating coordinates for the caves listed might be a good start. 

It also looks like the Wisconsin Speleological Society might be a knowledgeable local resource? It doesn't seem like their website ([http://www.wisconsincaves.org/) ](http://www.wisconsincaves.org/) has what you're looking for, but I would imagine some of the people involved may be able to provide some helpful information.
