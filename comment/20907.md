Can you share more about what you're using to capture the data on the existing device? Are you hoping this modification can be incorporated into your existing tool, or would this be a separate piece? It would be great to see a little more about how you've approached the first piece of this. 

It sounds like you'll be adding a sensor (you could probably use one or a few of several different kinds-- temperature, motion, etc) in connection with a datalogger, which you would either have write to an SD card or possibly connect via wifi. Does this sound right?

As for making everything invisible, it will depend a little bit on what components you end up using and how much set dressing you'll need to disguise them. As far as housing, I would imagine your considerations would include keeping things dry (and possibly a little insulated: I know my pipes can melt plastic when the heat is all the way up) Without knowing much about the specifics of the shower or showers you'll be testing in, I think there could be some ways forward in disassembling a showerhead to see if there are ways to sneak your boards or sensors inside (perhaps by removing some of the flow controls, etc) or else constructing a housing that could sit above the shower head or around the pipe and be protected/hidden by a housing, though your form will be dictated somewhat by the components you need to accomodate. 

You might find some of the notes about the [Riffle (an open source datalogger)](https://publiclab.org/tag/riffle) helpful in thinking about sensor/logger combinations, and I would also point you towards some of [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) 's work. Chris has done a [lot of really great monitoring projects](https://publiclab.org/notes/author/cfastie) (with really well documented how-to's) that I think could help you think through the process a bit.
