[@warren](/profile/warren), thx for the comment.  I checked with opencv, stitcher is not currently included in opencv.js, a list of the current wrappings is at: 

https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/js/src/embindgen.py#L82-L171

So at this point this technique is possible with a raspberry pi /python/opencv  but you would have to add the module to opencv.js
