Thank you Nedhorning, nice to see your answers in the my research note! I'm reading your notes about calibration trying to understand more about NDVI and calibration targets.

1) You listed some materials, which of those could be better as calibration targets for my goals? 

2) I'm in Italy and I think it'll be difficult for me get exactly the same materials you listed, if I buy those by you, is it possible to ship me the most suitable ones?

3) May I put here my eMail address to send me the reflectance spectral you have?



Thank you for your attention

best regards by LaPa
