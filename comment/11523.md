Hi bhickman, thank you for the very helpful info so far, Processing is all set up. (And I ended up using PLA for my 3D print.)
Concerning Energia:  I've set up the libraries from your Github page, and I don't know which to run first when I take the data with the CCD-PDA, or if there is a way to run the entire process all at once.
I also don't know how to set up the wiring of the PDA to the Tiva C Series Chip. I'm going off of your pictures and various Energia/Tiva C Series Launch pad how-to guides, and I'm guessing the way the diode array is wired to the Tiva C Series Launchpad is specific to the code in Energia. Any advice on the set up of energia and the PDA to the Launchpad would be greatly appreciated.
