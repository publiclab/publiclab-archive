Hi Chris!

You assumed right! :D
The pictures was taken with the pi noir and the blue filter and turned off the automatic white balance to set my own values (awb off awbg 1.28,0.57 determined in their [post](https://publiclab.org/notes/LaPa/12-03-2015/how-do-i-set-a-costum-white-balance-of-the-noir-modulo-cam)

Hi have done some areal images and test them with Fiji. Here are the results

visible:

NRG

NDVI (dual image index processing)

Single image index processing

At this point I am under the impression that the single image processing NDVI is more accurate than the dual image processing. What is your opinion? What could be happening?

ps: I'll confirm the species of the tree as soon as I am at the local.
