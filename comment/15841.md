I've focuses to 22cm, removed blue LED: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/91509
The blue hump is still there.  I'll try to change the DVD to see if it changes something.  I'll  look for light leakages, but it doesn't look like light is entering. Maybe the slit is to bright?

How to control "optical path skew" or "some distortion".
