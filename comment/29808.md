This latest update was motivated by several factors but the most important ones were: (1) Our own project has grown to the point that every fieldwork trip generates a significant number of dead batteries.  You can't spend your day doing groundwater research, without having some awareness of what that implies for the very environment you are trying to protect.
(2) A significant number of the teachers & NGO staff we want to help are basically buying everything out of their own pocket. This is especially true when you step out of the ivory tower and go to community colleges & high schools. That means you have to be able to kit an entire class for around $50 or you are only ever going to reach those who are already pretty well-off in the grand scheme of things. I think this 2-Part design might finally have broken through that barrier.
