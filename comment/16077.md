Hello [@kanarinka](/profile/kanarinka) I couldn't access the paper to read it (their sever seems to be having issues right now) so this is just a quick note to say that if you had not seed them already, a lot of these things have been discussed by:
Blikstein 2013 Digital Fabrication and ‘Making’ in Education: The Democratization of Invention https://tltl.stanford.edu/publications/papers-or-book-chapters/digital-fabrication-and-making-democratization-invention
Gerstein 2016 Becoming a Maker Educator https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-466298228/becoming-a-maker-educator
and
Kolb and Kolb 2005 Learning styles and learning spaces: Enhancing experiential learning in higher education https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Kolb/publication/201381976_Learning_Styles_and_Learning_Spaces_Enhancing_Experiential_Learning_in_Higher_Education/links/0c96052ab8d5142c1b000000.pdf
