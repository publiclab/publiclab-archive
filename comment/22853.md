From Muki Haklay: 
Check Antonella Radicchi blogpost on the range of apps from last year http://www.opensourcesoundscapes.org/2016/08/28/a-tentative-state-of-the-art-of-applications-for-crowdsourced-noise-sound-maps/ . Antonella’s Hush City app is quite comprehensive soundscape data collection tool.

 

Christian Nold also developed a DIY noise monitoring that he’s deploying around Heathrow http://www.softhook.com/heathrow/technology-involved/

 

Chunming Li, from the Chinese Academy of Science (who been with us at ExCiteS for the past year), developed an app for evaluating soundscapes - http://www.citi-sense.cn/download

 

There is also NoiseTube, one of the very first apps that was developed http://www.noisetube.net/team

 

There are issues with the calibration of phones with these apps, which was an issue in some of the work that we’ve done few years ago, so I would also think that you can use class I noise meters (they’re not super expensive – about £50 https://www.maplin.co.uk/p/digital-sound-level-meter-n05cc). One option for the Public Lab  community is to get one or two of those, and hack them so it’s possible to store the data (models with data storage cost much more), so that can be an idea…
