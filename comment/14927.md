Hi Sylvain,

I don't know the answer to this question because I don't quite understand hyperspectral scanning. But I think the answer is maybe. The type of spectrometer Public Lab uses does not scan through the wavelengths. It takes a photo of the diffraction pattern formed by an entrance slit and grating. The light intensity at each wavelength is recorded in a spectrogram (the photo) which can be graphed as brightness at each wavelength. If you point the spectrometer at different colored surfaces, the light reflected from those surfaces will form diffraction patterns which will differ from each other as the apparent color of the surfaces differ. So assuming that the source of illumination (the sun in this case) does not change between photos, differences among spectra could reveal color differences among surfaces.

Each spectrogram (photo of diffraction pattern) can be analyze later to determine how bright each wavelength was, so you can choose whichever wavelengths you want to study (mostly between 400 and 700 nm). The intensity at each wavelength is garbled by the color system in consumer digital cameras, so there is not a one-to-one relationship between intensity at each wavelength and the actual spectral brightness in the scene. But you might be able to work around that with some calibration targets.
