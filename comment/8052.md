Cool!  Glad you are interested in the project.  Parts of the project are still being developed/maintained but it's not very active at the current moment.  One platform that might also meet some of your needs is OpenDataKit, though that's an Android project.  If you like, find me on Skype at deepwinter44 and we could talk about if Rhus would be useful to you or other options that might also work.    If it seems like Rhus is the way to go, I could be convinced to tighten up some bits of it to make it really work for you - after all that's the point of open source!  So let's chat a little more when you are ready.
