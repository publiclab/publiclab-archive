Ned,

This approach looks really promising. I was writing a comment about how this fit in with our current way of making NDVI when I realized I didn't understand how it fit in. I couldn't answer these questions:

1.	How does this apply to dual camera systems, or does it apply only to single camera (Infragram) systems? (I think both)
2.	Is this approach objective as opposed to subjective? (I think yes) What makes our current approach subjective, and what makes this approach objective? (I couldn't articulate an answer)
3.	In what ways will this make the NDVI results better than our current results? (precision, accuracy, believability, comparability, interpretability)

And I have a follow-up.
