Hi
Sorry for the trouble but how did you proceed to calibrate individual bands to reflectance before calculating NDVI?
Did you use "dark object subtraction"?
I can calibrate to reflection satellite images but I don't know how to do it in photographs from my modified canon with a r25A filter.
Thanks for the trouble, and any advice possible.
Best regards,
Rita
