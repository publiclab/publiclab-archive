FYI- I've made edits to reflect some major updates in how this build is progressing!  The design/build phase is finally complete, and while the basic code has been uploaded to the controller unit, I'm guessing it'll still require significant tweaking.  Nevertheless, I should be ready for flight testing as soon as I return from a conference next week!
