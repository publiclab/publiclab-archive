Thanks a lot for reviewing [@ruthnwaiganjo](/profile/ruthnwaiganjo). 
The image I've put in the tag locking section is to show the lock icon. Sorry for the confusion. I'll update the image.
Regarding 'There is no option for users to subscribe for email notifications whenever there is a new post on topics they follow' I was actually referring to [this comment](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/9240#discussion_r586622062) on one of my PRs.
I've removed that feature for now.
Thanks again!
