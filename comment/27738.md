Hi [@mashalawais](/profile/mashalawais) These are great questions for a community resource guide to tackle. I'm only beginning to learn about resources that can help identify nearby industrial facilities and pollutants, and one that comes to mind is EPA's [Envirofacts](https://enviro.epa.gov/) database. Its search accesses multiple EPA datasets, with some data being industry self-reported and some being agency reported. 

This [recent post about databases](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/11-30-2020/comparing-air-quality-databases-a-fun-activity) is focused on air quality, but it mentions a few resources that cover several topics like air, water, and land.
