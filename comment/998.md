---This comment is a duplicate! I encountered an error in posting comments, today--looks like Scott you might have experienced that too? I received an error saying the window had timed out so I didn't think the comment went through? 

"Thanks for this Scott, I am just working on a research note about the samples so you and Shannon can see some images: in shipping some of the labels came unstuck so there are four canisters that I can't identify. I'm posting some photos in the hope that you can Shannon have ideas about how we can positively ID the unknown canisters."
