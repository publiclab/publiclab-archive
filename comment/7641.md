There are plenty of open sources of spectral data. Some are listed at [this Public Lab wiki](http://publiclab.org/wiki/spectral-analysis#Databases). I think the [NIST database](http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html) is a good standard with reasonable filtering and downloading capability. It has peak location and intensity, but includes lots of minor peaks that Public Lab spectrometers probably won't detect. 

If you take a spectrum of the sky, you can see the inconsistent effect of the three color channels. Assuming that the intensity should be constant from 400 to 900 nm, you can take the non-constant spectrum and derive the function to correct it. That will be valid only for that camera at that white balance setting. But it is probably worth doing if you want to compare peak intensity.
