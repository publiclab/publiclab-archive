[@warren](/profile/warren) is Notification API is also the part of GSoC idea and what its priority is ?
As this is not a big project for GSoC but we can also include another project along with it. What do you think ?
As I am researching the best way to do it using Action Cables and also researching how we can get notifications using service worker even when the website is not open and when only browser is open and more. So just curious to know.
Thanks
