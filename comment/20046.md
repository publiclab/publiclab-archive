As far as I can see that camera placement looks as it should. Going off on something of a tangent, do you happen to have a laser pointer. If you point the beam of a laser pointer through the spectrometer slit with the beam passing parallel to the base of the spectrometer when it strikes the diffraction grating it should bend down and pass into the camera lens. Probably best to temporarily stick a bit of white card over the camera lens to avoid danage to the sensor. This is why it is important to have the grating oriented correctly - the line across the grating need to be parallel to the base of the spectrometer so the diffracted beam bends down. If the lines of the grating are at right angles to the base the beam will bend to one side (well both sides actually). Does anyone have a handy drawing of the spectrometer geometry showing the light path? That might help.
