Wow, i'd love to see a photo, even if it's not ready yet!

I'm very optimistic about spectral resolution, and glad to see youre getting great results. (have you uploaded any to SpectralWorkbench.org yet?)

However, i'm more convinced that a lot of the >800nm data is 2nd order spectrum, and less sure about getting data above 800nm. Some have suggested that the red band of data may show clean >800nm data since it filters out blues. Any ideas about that?
