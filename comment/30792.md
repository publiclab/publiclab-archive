Now, to change the topic a little bit.  What happens once all this testing gets going?  In industry, a financial auditor appears and says " you are spending too much on testing".  So the usual approach is to check the data.  Do you have failures?  If the answer is no, frequently the company will do something like skip lot testing.  in skip lot testing, only one in say 20 lots is tested. This allows fewer tests to be done and ( theoretically) doesn't alter quality.  A few months later, the next step is taken.  Only one in 100 lots will be tested.  And so on and so on.  This is often accompanied by loss of personnel, etc.  When there is a failure, trying to nail down the exact lot of failure is difficult.  Because the samples tested are so few, large recalls must be done. The environmental work locally functioned in the same manner, with tests often done at long intervals.  A screening test might pick up problems earlier.
