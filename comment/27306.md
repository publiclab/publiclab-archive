Your photo is a little dark, and proper exposure is important to get meaningful NDVI results.

Your photo produces reasonable NDVI results with some manipulation. The NDVI image below was made in FIJI using Ned Horning's [Photo Monitoring Plugin](https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/01-13-2016/packaged-photo-monitoring-plugins-available-on-the-github-repositoy). The NIR channel was stretched while processing, something that cannot be done at Infragram. I tried your photo at Infragram and was not able to get any better results than you did. 

The color scale (0-255) represents NDVI values of -1 to +1.
