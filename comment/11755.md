Or without knowing the spectral response of the sensor, you can brute force the response of a dual-camera system by shooting through narrow band pass filters to capture only the bands you want to use for NDVI. The wavelengths used for both NIR and VIS could then be similar to those used in legacy NDVI. If you use calibration targets to calibrate the relative intensity of NIR vs VIS, those results could be comparable with legacy NDVI. Narrow band pass filters require longer exposure times so are not so suitable for UAV or kite use, but are easy to use on tripod mounted systems.
