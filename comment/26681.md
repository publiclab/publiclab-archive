And, as to the issues page, I like re-using that or refining it, but my thought is that in particular the Editor needs more than a URL to document a bug well; a screen capture or gif may be needed to show the exact sequence of interactions that led up to the bug, you know? 

Maybe we could repurpose parts of this issue to make an Editor-specific "report a bug and document it well" issue? https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/3513
