Real neat! 

two comments about the setup: the shinyei should have everything but the intake and outlet covered to prevent light leakage.

you may want to average measurements over a longer timescale than the 30 seconds recommended by Shinyei.  this post on India Air Quality details some of the issues of smoothing the sensors' noise out.
