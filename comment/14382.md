[@viechdokter](/profile/viechdokter), my approach would be to apply the "filtering" on the search end of the system (but I am a software developer, so my approaches tend to be IT-driven).  That way, there would not be any discouragement in posting questions, research, data, notes, etc for those who would be intimidated by having a gatekeeper up front.

To support the "ranking" system, however, there needs to be more than tags.  Tags are a good start, but all they really do is simplify keyword searches.  If I create/add a keyword ("best-research-ever"), it doesn't really mean anything unless someone both knows to search for that tag and agrees with the intent of the tag.

Other community-based organizations use rankings, "likes", etc. to lend credentials to a particular publications--this can be use in the results, but there will need to be a means of making those notations.  (And yes, there are plenty of examples of abuse of those systems, also.)

Conversely, [@stoft](/profile/stoft) is suggesting a more formal gatekeeper up front; that is, submissions must be properly vetted before public availability.  This has the effect of having strong scientific rigor (as strong as the reviewers can manage), but also has the potential effect of intimidating submitters who have no formal training, or can't/won't take the time to formalize the results.

Then there's the gray area:  If I take the time to collect spectrometry readings from the local watershed (or any equivalent) and post the data , how does it fair under either system?  It's just data and/or an example of usage for a PLab project.  It would be difficult to find in a completely open system, but it's not going to meet any substantial forms of peer-review rigor.

I would suggest that this discussion matters in a lot of ways beyond the purely philosophical.
