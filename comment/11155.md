I've been wondering about mailing these oil samples.  Motor oil is fine, becuase its flash point is high.  most "neat," or consumer commercial products, are OK.

I wonder how we get/prove we have info compliant with [USPS regulations?](http://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c3_020.htm#ep1030334)


from:  Publication 52 - Hazardous, Restricted, and Perishable Mail > 3 Hazardous Materials > 34 Mailability by Hazard Class > 343 Flammable and Combustible Liquids(Hazard Class 3)
