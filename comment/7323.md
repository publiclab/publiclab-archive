Andrew -- good point about motion blur. I see your nice shot of the stadium was taken at 1/20th second. Last night I tried to take cityscape photos from a plane window at night and got mostly black at 1/125th second. So my recommended 1/160th second probably won't work for most night scenes with a Powershot because the sensor is not sensitive enough. 

If Jessi wants to quantify spatial variation in light levels, the exposure should be constant for all photos. So manual lock of both aperture (wide open) and shutter speed (probably pretty slow) is required. This assumes all shots are after it becomes dark outside. Very calm ballooning conditions will probably be needed.
