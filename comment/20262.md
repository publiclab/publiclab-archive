[@jeffalk](/profile/jeffalk) I wouldn't say that I am particularly enthralled by 24 hour averages. The publicly accessible data that i've been able to find are daily averages and this was just a test-run with the tool using random data. They have "raw" data that is supposed to be available with some extra steps but I've had issues accessing that thus far and am working with the DEM to figure that out. I'm not sure how "raw" this data will be  i.e. whether or not they will have hourly recordings or not. Stay tuned.

I agree with you completely. I am more interested in the shorter time intervals, particularly the day time when people would be active and outside.
