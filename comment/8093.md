That's good to know about the A480. Thanks for adding it to the [wiki page](http://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram-convertible-cameras). 

There is a pretty good deal on [ebay right now for four 2"x2" gel filters including a 25A](http://www.ebay.com/itm/KODAK-GELATIN-FILTERS-WRATTEN-2-SQUARE-25A-15G-85-DAYLIGHT-TYPE-A-1A-SKYLIGHT-/331115438321?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4d1804a0f1). But you missed an auction for [two 3"x3" gel filters including 25A and 47B](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Kodak-Wratten-Gelatin-Filters-No-25-A-No-47B-3-x-3-/310856932442?pt=Camera_Filters&hash=item4860845c5a) because I just buyed it now. The [47B looks like it might be better than the Rosco](http://randombio.com/wratten-47-spectra.png) for infrablue, although more expensive. But I really wanted the 25A so I can corner the market.
