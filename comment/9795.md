Well done prop might be on the wrong way though..

HobbyKing Bixlers are $111 at the minute with RC gear and complete replacement airframes are in the $40 range. I use on to just chuck in a car and grab images with a Canon IXUS no autopilot and CHDK firing the shot. Using it for a weed clearing program on a dam just up the road at the minute. https://sketchfab.com/models/3afadb77f453466994a221eee3e98baf
