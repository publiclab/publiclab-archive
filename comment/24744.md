 Hi Dave, I know you made this post quite a while ago. Have you done any other exploration in HDR? I am trying to include it in an app that would automatically calculate the HDR profile (using, for example 3 images at known and different shutter speeds).

This method you proposed is very simple and very cool, especially since you only need one image. I think the drawback would be that maybe not all spectrometers have a consistent attenuation effect around the edges, and that the data may not be as accurate in the higher extrapolated intensities.

I was thinking instead to control the shutter speed? (Predefined exposures can be programmed for Raspberry pi, although it might be more difficult to achieve in other webcams.  There is an equation already implemented in matlab here (http://www.pauldebevec.com/Research/HDR/debevec-siggraph97.pdf) and here (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cyy/courses/vfx/07spring/lectures/handouts/lec02_hdr.pdf) describing how you can generate a sensor response curve based on a series of images. This would produce very repeatable results, but is harder to implement in software! If you had any experience with this I'd love to know.
