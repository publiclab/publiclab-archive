I would love to be able to characterize oils, olive oil in particular.  Two areas of characterization: Adulteration and Quality.

A very high percentage of Extra Virgin Olive Oils (60% in a UC Davis study 4 years ago) are blended with either oils not from olives or from olive oil that has been extracted using solvents that are still in the oil.  That Bertolli you tested probably has those solvents in it.  I'd like to see a way for consumers to detect this easily, or at least a techy consumer.  Palm oil is a very common blending oil in EVOO.

Another high percentage problem in store purchased EVOO is the oil is not really EVOO.  The most common problem is storage failure:  Too old, to high or low temperature during storage, or exposure to UV light that destroys the monounsaturated bonds in olive oil.  Most of these defects show up as the presence of free fatty acids or in loss of polyphenol levels.

Disclaimer - I produce EVOO, and I try my best to make it the best, so finding a tool that makes it easy to see quality difference would benefit me and others like me.
