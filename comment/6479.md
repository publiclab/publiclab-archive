I'd agree that giving more visibility the the clipping issue would be good and this is a simple, cheap tool. However, I don't quite follow your 2-strip and auto-detection scheme.

The attenuator covers the entire light path (which is only the size of the slit). I suppose a atten-clear-atten pattern (blocking the slit width into 3 bands) would show in the "swath" of spectral color (top 1/3 darker, mid 1/3 brighter and bot 1/3 darker) ... except I suspect users would naturally just pick the middle and have clipped data as usual. Maybe I missed your point.

The other issue is that the amount of attenuation will be different for every case. Just changing the distance to the source has a significant effect.

How about an 8.5x11 sheet of various attenuator values -- then, when there is clipping, select an atten to add -- one of them will at least be closer to max w/o clipping. A variable-grade atten could be printed though when you want repeatability, it's hard to know the atten 'setting' and return to the same value.
