Thanks [@cversek](/profile/cversek)! The first power supply we tried was some cheap $1.50 things we found on Amazon ([see the Ground Computing thread here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/groundcomputing/byrUTu-5aMo)) so when you said it might be the power supply the light bulb went off in my head. I was surprised to find that even when I plugged into other big name brand wall socket to USB power supplies that all of them caused interference. It was only a MacBook Air's USB power supply and the DustTrak that we have found so far to not cause this interference.
