I contacted some folks at Airmetrics, and their initial reaction was that I appeared to be doing it correctly (but they didn't really dig in). The inconsistency between their numbers was a bit troubling and warranted looking into, but didn't seem to have any practical consequences:

The numbers I got were well within the +/- 2% range that the calibration is attempting to reach, we should be fine to use this calibration system, for now.
