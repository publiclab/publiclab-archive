Here's a good resource on many plug standards: http://connector.pinoutsguide.com/4_pin_3.5mm_2.5mm_plug/

But it seems that tip and ring 1 are usually audio left/right, ring 2 is ground, and sleeve is the mic input. I'm on a Chromebook but it works with my Apple headphones, so I assume it's good too. 

But it sounds like video cable pinouts are different:

That shows: Tip: left, ring 1: video, ring 2: ground, sleeve: right

That means I should cross Red/White and White/Red, I believe. 

I tried this and still wasn't able to get the chromebook to recognize a microphone device. But I was able to get the phone to "hear" the chromebook -- i'll attach the recording in a moment.
