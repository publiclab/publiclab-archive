Actually, based on your comment here: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/08-15-2013/white-balancing-a-canon-camera-for-infragram-photography -- I think my plants need to be a little more orange. 

Are there instructions on how to reset the white balance once I've already set it, or do I just point it at another piece of blue paper? Thanks again.
