Great article - I noticed that the first image shows an equation (NIR-R|G|B)/(NIR+R|G|B). The way the R,G,B are shown, the mathematical operations aren't clear, but only NIR and R are used to calculate NDVI:

NDVI=(NIR-R)/(NIR+R)

I would suggest fixing the image and also providing the correct equation as text (not just as an image).
