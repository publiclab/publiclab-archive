NDVI uses an NIR and a Red band. Some documents have noted that instead of red you can any visible band but from my point of view that is not correct. The results might be similar but there are a few reasons red is used. One is that from a satellite, the red wavelengths are less affected by the atmosphere. The second reason is that as vegetation vigor declines the red reflectance is impacted more than the shorter visible wavelengths. In the figure below you can see that the difference in reflectance between green and dry grass is much greater in the red band (0.7 micrometers) than in the rest of the visible spectrum. There is very little difference in the blue (0.45 micrometers) band. That greater difference makes it easier to detect a decline in vegetation vigor.

I spotted another issue on that page. When you create an NRG  image the NIR band does not replace the red of a true color (RGB) image. Instead, the band order becomes NIR, Red, Green. 

I hope that helps.
