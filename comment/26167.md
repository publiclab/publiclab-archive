Whenever we have such large numbers of columns then we first perform correlation analysis before plotting the graphs. In correlation analysis, we compute the correlation coefficient of each column with the other column. 
I performed a correlation analysis on the above dataset 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ie5Jzyd8CIT8ZBFQU2I67Ph1eklJcoZ2x-laeGT3qyw/edit?usp=sharing
you can see that out of 32 main attributes 24 attributes are highly correlated(as the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.99.And it very very high) .So instead of keeping all the 24 attributes we only keep 1 attribute as the other 23 attributes won't give us any information about the data. By this way, we can have also reduced the size of the dataset by 75%(from 32 attributes to 9 attributes).And as you mentioned above the problem of high values, To deal with this before plotting the graphs we replace the outliers by the mean of that column. We generally classify an outlier as a data point which lies outside the range (mean+-1.5*IQR). After replacing then we should plot the graph
