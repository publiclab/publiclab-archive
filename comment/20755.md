Hi [@apparao](/profile/apparao) -- thanks for your question. I haven't used the mobius with a tablet, but I took a look at some forums and it seems like the "official" android app may be semi-retired, but there's an independent developer working on maintaining an app that works for some configurations. They seem to be pretty responsive to questions over in the [Q/A in the Google Play ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.chladek.mobiusactioncam&hl=en_US)store, so if someone here isn't able to help, you might have luck getting answers over there (my impression from scanning the Q/A is that compatibility has more to do with which mobius model you have than it does with your android tablet). I'll try to connect a mobius to my phone sometime this week to see if anything about the process jumps out at me and report back.
