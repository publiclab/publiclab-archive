 [@rexagod](/profile/rexagod) Thanks for sharing your interesting proposal.   I have a question not related to the code but example  pictures/gifs  described above.   It looks like your stitching the same picture?  If this is this case, shouldn't it be a null result?  Also, the road is aligned but portions of the road (below the intersection) are  not matched?   Should the non-match areas also determine when images are /are not stitched?  Great coding BTW.  Thank You
