The Photo Monitoring plugin already has a command that generates NDVI from a folder full of images (Single image index processing from directory). You can specify which channels to use for red and for NIR. I also use a red filter and I have no problems running a batch NDVI job with the plugin. 

Just wondering, why does your macro run a channel split?
