[@liz](/profile/liz) there is indeed a lot of potential synergy between what we're doing and the NYC DEP testing. Essentially we're building on their methods and updating it with 21st century technology to (1) allow _any_ faucet to be tested by using mobile web forms, geolocation, pictures of the faucet, etc and (2) to have all the data shown live on a public map so that anyone can know which fountains have been tested safe.
Do you happen to know anyone I might reach out to at NYC DEP that would interested to develop that synergy?
