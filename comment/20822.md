As discussed above , effective image magnification can be determined by image scaling against a known reference.   This is also sometimes referred to as the magnification triangle -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBJdxRRmGeU
I used this method  to calculate microscope overlay grid spacing â€“ 
https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/06-23-2018/microscope-calibration-overlays-what-s-the-best-approach


Another approach (digital image pipeline) determines how each item  impacts magnification:

This requires:
Objective magnification, 
Reverse lens /microscope adapter magnification,
Detector diagonal dimension, 
	-Raspberry Pi v2 is 4.6mm(.18in)
	-Webcam ????,
TV monitor diagonal dimension. 

Once values are determined, they can be multiplied in a table  for easy reference.  See: 
http://www.spotimaging.com/resources/white-papers/calculate-total-magnification/


It may be possible to use one  method to cross check the other.  

Inconsistent results will probably occur if settings change, different monitors are used, etc.
