Yes replication barnstars!! We need to refine and expand the replication features. 

I'd like to try a couple variations like high/low airflow, comparison of plant vs just carbon, that sort of thing -- but I need to catch up on how to measure/evaluate formaldehyde to do such tests. I guess I don't have to wait until then to start making one of these, but it does seem like it'd be helpful. 

Also -- is there an active discussion of whether airflow could go the other way, and the pump could be unmodified? Maybe I could ask that as a question?

This is so cool! I want to do mine in a glass container so I can watch some of the root growth.
