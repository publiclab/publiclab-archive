Update from Naomi.  This was a rush build, and crews were still out re-burying the pipeline in late September 2019. The pipeline has been pumping oil since April 2019.

Here are some notes from a field visit at low water (<a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/la/nwis/uv?cb_00065=on&format=gif_default&site_no=07381450&period=&begin_date=2019-09-20&end_date=2019-09-29">~5.8 feet at Bayou Sorrel Gauge</a>), showing the hills left behind by construction

In this shot, the pipeline is buried under the orange marker.  You can imagine how the emery boards would be useful here, for measuring the hill left after construction. If Dean, the guy with the camera, is 6 ft, you can imagine how the right of way, which Dean is climbing, has changed the flow of water into and out of the swamps.

Ivor stands in front of  a spoil pile for Bayou Bridge Pipeline, for sense of scale. Ivor's kind of tall, and standing in front of the pile, which is higher.  But you really need a simple survey method to measure things which are 10 feet in elevation difference, at most.
