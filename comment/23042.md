Emailed in from Erin Haacker: "I poked around in that direction, and you might consider getting in touch with J. Raymond Kessler: http://hort.auburn.edu/kessler/, kessljr@auburn.edu. He’s the first author on this (admittedly old) extension document, “Hydroponics for Home Gardeners”: https://store.aces.edu/ItemDetail.aspx?ProductID=13551#prettyPhoto... I’m not sure that the actual technical details of hydroponics would have changed much in the past few years, since we’ve pretty much figured out how to grow plants – in this case, going high tech might just mean spending more money for a similar yield."
