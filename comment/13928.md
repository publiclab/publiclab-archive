Hi, Franktank - yes, updating the gem versions would be great, but if you wanted to do that, I think we should build out the test suite more so that we can be better assured that we aren't breaking anything. So if you'd like to add that to your project, perhaps that makes a nice pairing with the Profile Tags system. 

Since there are [proposals now up](/notes/warren/03-10-2016/google-summer-of-code-2016-draft-proposals) for Search/Sorting and for the Q&A system, perhaps you should rename yours "Profile tagging" or "Rich Profiles" to indicate that this would be your main focus (as you've outlined in your work plan). That'll also encourage other applicants to focus on other areas and overlap less.
