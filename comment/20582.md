[@jeffalk](/profile/jeffalk) PM concentrations do not have meaning if there isn't an understanding of how the concentrations affect health and well being. Perhaps I used the term 'AQI' incorrectly but I think that this "important misconception" as you call it is actually the least important part of this analysis. The relative differences between the categories and the length of exposure to each category is what matters. If you prefer, I can create my own index that I will name the "Jite Index" that ranks from 'low -> medium -> high -> really high' PM concentrations. I can arbitrarily decide what the cutoff points will be for each category and I would result in the exact same pie chart as shown in the post representing the length of exposure to different categories.
