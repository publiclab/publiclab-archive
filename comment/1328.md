Hello Josh, nice UV spectra.
What a fine application this turns out to be, I think I am going to back kickstarter but probably will build my own before I get mi pledge delivered.

But I would like to build a UV/Visible Spectrometer, that would go down at least 350nm and, if I may ask, even as low as 300nm. For this I need to figure out about 2 issues, which you and Jeff may be able to clarify:

* Woud the HD cam pick up emissions down to 350 or 300nm?
* What light source do you use for the above measurements? Is that a LED or a pointer Laser? If yes, isn't the emission spectrum quite narrow from these sources and as such, limits the usefullness of a full spectrum spectrometer? What other UV/Visible light sources may be of interest? I have a old Spectronic 20D spectrophotometer, which uses one of these bulbs (30$):

They can go as low as 320nm and upwards into the 900nm if I am not wrong, but I don't know about what current and voltage they have to be fed.
I was also thinking about Xenon lamps used for cars, the one with high K temperatures in the blueish tones. But these need a ballast and 12V source.

I will recieve a 3D printer in a couple of weeks and will be printing the parts to my spectrometer. Hope to be able to upload some of my progress by then.
