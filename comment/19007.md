Hi [@vidit](/profile/vidit),
Sincerely I am unfamiliar with the options exposed. From a superficial read, does this mean we need to add Redis to our deployment? I've not used it in the past, but I'm open to learn it if we have to use it!
In general please make sure any dependencies we integrate must be supported upstream. For instance the `capistrano-resque` repo you linked hasn't had a commit in 1.5 years and nobody [responds to issues](https://github.com/sshingler/capistrano-resque/issues).
