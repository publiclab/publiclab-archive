Thanks for info. The projects linked are interesting but quite different. A spring flood and some changes to the local EPA have encouraged me to move on from my original sensor project related to water quality monitoring. In addition, our community is applying for Dark Sky Status so this seemed like a good alternative.  There is a citizen science program, Global Meteor Network, that uses meteor track data collected by various volunteers around the world.  Data from neighboring locations are combined and the meteor tracks are triangulated to provide distance, direction, speed, etc. The project is relatively new, but looks pretty interesting. I've registered and ordered the list of equipment (camera, RasPi, etc) and hope to start assembling my station in the next month or so.  Perhaps I'll start a project page to track my progress. Thanks again for the info.
