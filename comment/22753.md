Hi, Nick - we've been starting to organize some user interface design materials and techniques on https://publiclab.org/wiki/ui, mostly focused on the PL website. But some of these methods are universally helpful. Maybe we could build out some of these with an eye to usability across projects, including tips and resources on:

* user studies
* design heuristics
* activities for user input

What are your main goals? I think choosing a narrower one to start with may make it easier to begin -- for example, if you:

1. wanted to find the "pain points" or design elements which need the most help in the existing UI, OR
2. wanted to ask people how they think the UI would ideally work, essentially starting with a blank sheet

or something else. Navigation. Or the refining the UI for the very first few moments of use. Each could become a design project in itself, some broader, some narrower.
