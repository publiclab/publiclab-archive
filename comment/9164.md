Many thanks to Ned and the other conversion pioneers. On my second try I followed these instructions and successfully converted an A2200.  On my first try I did not quite follow these instructions and may have a A2200-shaped brick--I'm handing it off to someone with better fine motor skills and more microelectronics experience to try for recovery.  (I'm not worried, this is about the learning curve I expected) The following amplification on Ned's instructions may be useful to others: when you move the display out of the way of the sensor circuitry, be sure that you move the screen to the bottom of the camera exactly as pictured in Ned's "remove display screen" photo above. This can be accomplished by slightly lifting the screen to clear the tabs and then rotating counter clockwise about 45 degrees about the upper right corner of the screen assembly--just about where the small metal post is in Ned's photo.  The reason for this is that there is ribbon cable just underneath the screen assembly at that corner that attaches to a connector on the circuit board underneath.  If you move that corner too far you will pop the ribbon out of the connector and the camera will no longer work.
