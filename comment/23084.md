I don't think calculations at Infragram.org can be used for anything but determining the color of a new image. The Photo Monitoring plugin and Fiji can average any part of an NDVI image: https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/01-13-2016/packaged-photo-monitoring-plugins-available-on-the-github-repositoy
