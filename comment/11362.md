Jeff, yes I think there were a couple attempts to 'correct for non-linearities' using polynomial curve-fit functions. They assumed there was some hidden non-linearity of diffraction or distortion within the optics. While the optics could add some distortion, I believe the primary error in the present linear-ratio can be fixed with a closed-form calculation. My algorithm is in Matlab and I can get you a better-annotated version of the core calculations in a day or so..
