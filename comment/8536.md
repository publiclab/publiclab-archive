This is really fantastic!  I've been looking at calculating area of landfills using bing maps but havent thought about calculating volume.  Below is the project I'm currently working on which you might find interesting or might be able to use to calculate area.  The idea behind this project is to crowdsource the total area of all landfills in the country.  Check it out!  www.crowdcrafting.org/app/landfill

ps, this is still in development so any data you collect wont be saved...and please excuse the bugs :)
