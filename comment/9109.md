Thanks for the work.

This weekend we will make some experiments with the sky-cam flying a flone (quadcopter with android onboard) over some mountains near Barcelona.

Why the actual version is not in android play? Right now is a bit dificult to share.

I'm thinking about a better way to have the pictures of the camera back in another phone, i thing a basic streaming should work better than have hundred of pictures in the mail inbox.
