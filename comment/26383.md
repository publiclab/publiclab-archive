Hi!!
Here are a few resources you could check out:  

- https://projects.propublica.org/louisiana/
- https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/01/louisianas-disappearing-coast

Also a short list here: http://mississippiriverdelta.org/our-coastal-crisis/land-loss/   

There's also a pretty good book about it here called "Bayou Farewell: The Rich Life and Tragic Death of Louisiana's Cajun Coast" by Mike Tidwell . It's a bit dated now, but a lot of the concepts remain the same.
