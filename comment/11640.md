Thanks Chris for your comments. "Part B" of these tests is to attach the red filter to the key chain camera instead of the blue one. I have two of these same cameras, one without near-IR filter to which I attach the blue or red filter and the other with the factory IR filter. I examined the one I use with the blue filter with a microscope and found that during the removal of the IR filter a small damage was done to the lens. I do not know to what extend it changes the wavelength transmission, and the lens cannot be replaced -no spare parts available anywhere-. I will take away the IR filter from the second, this time avoiding any possible damage to the lens and attach the red filter to it. I will do a test with both, the lens-damaged one and this later one, with red filters to be sure if there is a wavelength attenuation or other effect.  I still have a third identical camera which I will keep for normal footage for reference. These cameras cost between $25 and $50, internal batteries last about 1hr (better than the drones'). I would be more careful with a Mobius ($80-$100). Thanks again.
