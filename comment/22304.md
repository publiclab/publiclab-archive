Hi Mary, This is a great question. I want to clarify that I don't necessarily think AERMOD is a *bad* model -- it just has draw-backs, and those draw-backs could explain differences between observed and modeled air quality indicators. Anyway, I've been reading a bit about the models (information hosted [here](https://www3.epa.gov/scram001/dispersion_prefrec.htm)), especially since it looks like CALPUFF is the model of choice for modeling emissions' impacts on visibility and regional haze. I agree with [@guolivar](/profile/guolivar) that the appropriateness of a model is dependent on its intended use though. It looks like a combination of AERMOD and CMAQ has been deemed the best available modeling for primary pollutants (the NAAQS pollutants) in the continental US.
