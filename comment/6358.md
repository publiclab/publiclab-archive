I've got some photos to share of the event too. How can we share them? I need one with a picture of the balloon above the canoe -- anyone have that?

Great summary Chris. It was a *real* pleasure connecting with all of the folks at PublicLab, and also with Jake at Hackerfarm. Thanks again Don for doing so much of the organizing. I look forward to more collaboration in the future.

Here at UMass, we plan to stitch some of the images together, georeference them, and then connect the field data we collected to do a supervised classification of the images. I'm not sure when we'll have that all done. Probably sometime in the Fall unless someone wants to help us with the image stitching. 

I'm chomping at the bit to do this work -- wish my other work wasn't in the way of it!

More (hopefully) soon...
