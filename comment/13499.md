Well, i'm not saying this is an important step in any particular analysis -- just that you can do operations like this easily with the `transform` tool. You can use a different expression to do a simple cutoff -- and if you can come up with one, that'd be great to share. 

I can think of one way to do it differently -- to run `Math.ceil(A-0.15)`- and multiply that by the original value. That way anything above 15% is multiplied by 1 (so it stays the same) and anything below is dropped to zero. `Math.ceil(A-0.15)*A`, which would look like this:

My point is that we can try lots of variations easily using the new Operations system.
