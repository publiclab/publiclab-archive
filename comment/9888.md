What you want to accomplish would be like making Public Lab the AppStore or Kindle eBook Store for research notes, but without the pay. It's a distribution channel, and as such, it would need a ton of new considerations which do not presently exist. It isn't an easy problem.

iframe sounds like an easy solution, until you consider the analogy of AppStore or Kindle eBook Store. They could never merely link through to the content from authors who publish. Both are heavily curated, come with all kinds of legal concerns, etc. You are proposing PL become the AppStore of open science, a publication medium. That's very different from what it is now, and will take a lot lot lot of consideration. Not something that can be done between three people shooting the stuff in a research note comment block.
