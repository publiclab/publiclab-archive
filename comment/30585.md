The symbiosis relationship between farm raised catfish and tilapia is mutualism. Tilapia eats algae which can affect the taste of catfish. These algae can also be toxic to catfish. Tilapias tend to produce rapidly than catfish, but they can co-exist if Tilapia is later introduced when the farm raised catfish are more matured. Catfish can also be feed with Tilapia to reduce cost to some farmers, but the pond must be monitored regularly. The catfish can also act as a population control for tilapia hence maintaining the balance in the pond naturally.
