Hi [@Yogesh](/profile/Yogesh)! Thanks so much for your proposal! 

I added a note also to https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/9257 with thanks for your research on the 404 error, with a recommendation there. 

And I wanted to point out my comment at https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/9257#issuecomment-816836984 which is relevant to your proposal as well! 

I like the examination of the first 2 more technical issues. I'm curious for your thoughts on the part about coordinating translators, onboarding them, the social and cooperative parts! What do you think about building out the guidance at https://publiclab.org/wiki/translation and developing a group/topic on PublicLab.org to coordinate different language translations? What are some ways we can make this process inviting and supportive, and to have good communication all along the workflow, from noticing an untranslated text or missing language all the way to publishing new translations to the site?

Thanks a lot Yogesh!!!!
