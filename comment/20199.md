Hi spectrometrists :) 

I've just ordered the Lego-parts and I'm going through the instructions now. I don't really follow the step:

*"Tape or glue the DVD slice onto a piece of stiff black card paper (as provided in our kit), or use Lego to make a frame if you like.
[..]
Now fold up and add the black paper liner included in the kit."*

Do I understand correctly: The grating frame is only affixed to the liner and this is loosely placed in the Lego casing. How will this provide a stable 65° angle and stable distance to the camera?
Would it make more sense to fix the grating frame directly to the lego walls? 
Or is gluing the frame to the liner and the liner to the walls actually enough? 

Also, I didn't find the blueprints for the liner anywhere. Did you make them available yet?

Thanks for your help, looking forward to actually building it :)
