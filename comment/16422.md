Ah, great, thank you! As to actions required, I think we might start with some simple ones, like:

* read listing of recent pull requests
* read pull requests
* read pull request comments
* comment on pull request
* all the above but for issues
* read listing of recent research notes
* read individual research notes
* read research note comments
* write research note comments

Not that we'd have to tackle all of these at once, but it'd be good to know how many distinct API URLs we're talking about. And for the Public Lab site, how many we'd have to create -- would this, for example, require making a unique Public Lab user account for the bot, and creating a unique token system so that it could post without needing to log in with a session?

Thanks!
