Hi Steven, I'd like to follow up with you on updates from this project.  I've done quite a bit of work with organic extractions, and two important things to consider are hydrophobicity and polarity.  Methanol is only slightly more polar than DCM, but it is hydrophilic, so as you found, it is not likely to work many a lot of pesticides, but is likely to impact the raspberry structure.  Ethyl acetate might be a better alternative.  What is your ventilation system though?  DCM is quite toxic, so I hope you are working in a fume hood!
