hi [@madtinker](/profile/madtinker), I know what you worry about it. I will say that the power bank is oK, since the main board is arduino uno. The power input will be 2 ways, the usb will be accepted by 5v which is almost all of the usb power bank use. the other input is for the battery like li-battery which is from 7.4~12v.
If you use a li-battery like 7.4v, the voltage will be low to 5v by the chip on the board. So don't worry about it. Both them will be ok.
And I think I will put your question into FAQ. Would you mind me to do that?
