American Science and Surplus is out of the square glass bottles: http://www.sciplus.com/p/WHITCAP-BOTTLE_48212

I called them and they said that the manufacturer discontinued them.  

Did Public Lab buy them out?  ; )

Any thoughts on a replacement?  I'd like to keep a stock of them in house.
