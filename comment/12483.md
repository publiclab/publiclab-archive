Thanks [@klie](/profile/klie) and [@danbeavers](/profile/danbeavers) for your feedback and appreciation. A few clarifications that as I re-read the research note I realise are not clear: (i) We used more than one ballon, the truth is 2 were shot down and one burst when it got caught on a nail in a narrow alley (and that taught us that these balloons do burst!) but when they were shot at, we were able to patch them up and keep going for the day. After that we were unable to reuse them. The tyre shop tried to see if something could be figured out that would be more long-lasting using the balloon that was shot down and the remainders of the burst one, but with no luck.  (ii) To get all 16 locations we actually took 2 months - we tried kites and when the first balloon was shot, we had to wait until we got a replenishment of balloons from Public Lab. In addition, we had to do it on weekends when the team was not at school, and [@Firas](/profile/Firas) and [@Mustafa10](/profile/Mustafa10) who were super passionate about the mapping are also in the camp's music band (they play bagpipes) so that meant we had to juggle various things when scheduling days to map (aside from rain and wind!). Last thing that took us time was helium, it is very expensive, and Firas who is studying to be a nurse, found out about the supplier of medical gas to the local hospital and through him got cheaper helium! So I realise the note reads as if we did it all in one day, but rather it took much longer. Still, on our last day mapping we managed to do 6 locations. The rest were done getting 2-3 locations per day (on average). As we waited for the new replenishments of balloons and helium, we did go to check rooftops and places from where we could map. This meant that while it took us a long time to do the actual mapping, we ended up talking to a lot more people in the process and really getting to know the camp inside out!
