      Threatened species are plants and animals that are likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future. However, endangered species are current plants and animals that have become so rare they are in danger of becoming extinct. One reasons plants ad animals become endangered or threatened is a sudden imbalance in the ecosystem. This imbalance can be cause by invasive species. In the 1980s, the swamps of the South Florida Everglades were introduced to one of the most damaging invasive species the region has ever seen - the Burmese python. 
      The pythons were shipped to Florida to be kept as pet but were dumped by the pet owners after they grew to an unmaintainable size. The Burmese python became the new apex predator in the ecosystem the Everglades inhabited, damaging the ecosystem. The previous harmony o the ecosystem was disrupted. Currently animals such as the Key Largo wood rat, wood stork, raccoons, bobcats, and many more have become endangered and/ or threatened. A huge thanks to Public Lab for that allows the average person to become aware of our constantly changing environment. *Gianna Williams*
