[@Zengirl2](/profile/Zengirl2) Absolutely! We did this testing at Deer Island Sewage Treatment Plant, which is the Boston metropolitan area's sewage treatment plant. These tests were placed in the "Grit Room" where the untreated sewage first comes into the facility. As you could imagine, it is smells a lot like H2S and more...
