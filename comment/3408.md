Hi Martin,

This is fantastic and encouraging. I am looking to build up the spectrometer like you made. Need some tips for the same. I want to get spectra of some samples and will like to know what container you used to put the samples? I mean you must have kept the sample in between spectrometer and the light source right? So what container you used to put the sample in? Does the distance of the sample from the light source matters? I may be wrong in getting the whole concept, can you please shed some light on it? Your work is inspiring :)
