Hey, nice work :)

I have also had problems with the legs getting detached during printing, and discovered there was a bug in my OpenSCAD code - it left an infinitesimal gap that meant the leg didn't join properly.  I've squashed it now, though.

I think there should be an LS65 illumination module on the github now, but in any case this should also get easier as I've revised the OpenSCAD files to use a common set of parameters - so (as long as you're compiling from OpenSCAD) it should be easier to get a consistent set of parts.

What I should really do is make an automated build system where you just choose the parameters and go - but that will take me a while...

Anyway, I'm very glad you found this version worked better!
