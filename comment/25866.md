Apparently a capital F and a lowercase f mean something different. I changed my post to a lowercase f=3.85mm. Apparently f is focal length and F is the F-stop, "speed" or how light sensitive the lens is.

My lens only has the little f designation. So I guess my question is better stated to ask what focal length would be best to get?? 

The only thing I found reference to so far in looking through what you recommended is that they used an f=8mm lens for the high rez camera testing. I cannot tell if the one linked has IR filter or not, or if 8mm is optimal for the lower res webcams.

I am still digging around though...
