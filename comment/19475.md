Mr Warren,
-That would be great!  Not sure if I can do anything more but take some pictures but happy to try.  


Initial questions: 
-Please note, I only have a 20x objective.  I noticed that the microscope design (https://publiclab.org/notes/partsandcrafts/11-26-2017/building-a-raspberry-pi-microscope) used a 40x objective.  Is there a 'depth of field'  design goal for the stage prototype?  

-Why is the microscope stage design  inverted?   Is there a  measurement  that requires a 'looking up' objective? 

Thank You
