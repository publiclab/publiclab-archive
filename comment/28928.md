Well, there are a couple of options.  One is that the calibration standard is off.  You'd have to get another instrument to check that out.  The other is that there is an oxygen leak in the building.  Unlikely. First, is there any source of oxygen in the building? But to be safe, take the instrument outside and see if the values go down.  If there is a source of oxygen in the building and they go down alot, call 911 and get out.
