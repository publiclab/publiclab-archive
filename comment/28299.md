Hi [@velahs](/profile/velahs),

The improvements you have obtained are really good.

I would like to know, what is the process that you have followed to improve your first NDVI image, and generate the second one in which the plants show yellow and orange colors?
In other words, how did you normalize the gray scales to produce the last image of the NDVI values?
