One of my early underwater housing designs had only three parts. A PVC endcap, a short length of pipe, and a rubber end cap. This came to about$10 for parts from the hardware store, and only needed one single cut to make:

That unit survived for >3 months under water at 5m depth, in 50% marine salinity, without too much corrosion on the pipe clamp. The rubber tends to flex inwards at depth, but for deployments <2-3m it would probably work OK. I have since moved on to an O-ring based housing to get down to greater depths (20-40m), but those are much more work to build. But there still might be something in there that helps with your project:
