Awesome!!! We're going to start distributing these with buttons and low-profile batteries soon at http://store.publiclab.org so including a button would really be awesome. If there's some way we could install that standard on the flashed SD cards we're including, that'll make life easier for folks just wanting to get out there and start taking photos quick :-)
