Is it important the station in which the photo is taken? I mean, how do you differ infrared reflected radiation from infrared emitted radiation (thermal radiation)? Because I suppose it will be very different from winter to summer and it will affect to NDVI computation.

Another doubt: What's the difference between a spectral curve and an Ebert's curve? I don't find it. 

Thanks!
