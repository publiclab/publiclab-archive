I echo Dave's thought about ordering, and agree that it means we'd prefer a client-side implementation of both auto-extraction of spectral response and auto-calibration. I left a question on Pascal's proposal to that effect too.

Yes!!!! I agree. Also about your CSRF token idea. Another thought I had was that we could use the time dimension differently for long-term monitoring... we could have each row of pixels represent a single scan, at 5-minute intervals, or whatever. I dunno... just thinking of how to reduce the need to store whole images every N minutes. And Dave is right about this too -- if we have spectrum extraction (of unclipped data) client-side, on-the-fly in javascript, we don't need to store the whole image for long-term monitoring. We can store just the good data we collect every 5 minutes. I think that's an acceptable amount of raw data to store... Dave?
