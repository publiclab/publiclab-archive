node: Why do raw RGB values differ from calibrated RGB values? I thought calibration just set pixels to wavelength (nm)?

There are definitely decimal values that don't seem quite right. Thanks for pointing to the code. I'll try to have a look in the next few days. 

Apologies in advance if I'm delayed ... It's well past bedtime here, and I've neglected some other semi-urgent stuff while having 'fun' with this. 

Last answer: we got a Desktop Spectrometry Kit 3.0 in the post within the last month. That has the revised webcam, and I ended up putting the dvd grating right on the silver front of the webcam, and adjusting the angle slightly. We also made a bigger slit - about 3x wider - for more light, presumably at a slight loss of resolution.
