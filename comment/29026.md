For the most part, my experience was on the manufacturing end.  And the answer would be very similar, but stated quite differently  " the cost benefit analysis must justify additional instrumentation/personnel/and testing".There would have been things like GMP,GLP, etc. That also would have helped the issue along.  But in the end, for individual batches, yes to testing.  Any backup data (say the equivalent of PM2.5) always had to be justified.  Repeatedly.
