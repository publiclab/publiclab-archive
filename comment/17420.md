The following articles may be useful in deploying VIIRS data for disaster  damage impact: Chris Justice (NASA Goddard) et al. link to the full article http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgrd.50771/full which appeared in the Journal of Atmospheric Research. Purdue's MultiSpec freeware could potentially be utilized to analyze the data. Contact Larry Biehl https://engineering.purdue.edu  . Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite is accessible through https://earthdata.nasa.gov .
