Hi jrmc502,

I found your project proposal very interesting.

I have no practical experience with Electrochemistry but I am studying the subject with plans to assemble a potentiostat and use it in projects for chemical analysis of water.

I would like to learn more to "try to contribute" to your project.

Can I use this list for exchanging messages? Or do you prefer use the project page?
