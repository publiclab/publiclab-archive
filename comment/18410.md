Chris, Thanks for the notes, appreciate that!

I should clarify, this was my second flight with this rig and these cameras. A year prior I had done 3 shorter balloon flights with cheaper cameras and rigs including an iPhone. I got a few good snapshots but poor photogrammetry. 

I had seen the Saturn V Rig, and perhaps I should reconsider it. I was trying to keep the equipment as simple and inexpensive as possible, but with a lighter load I might save money on helium over multiple flights!

I also have an artistic goal here, simply to produce nice photographs, and the cheaper cameras simply did not have adequate sensors or resolution, the Canon G series seemed like a good compromise between quality and weight.
