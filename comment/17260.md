This is super. Maybe "Code Links and Statistics" could go at the end? 

What if we better highlighted:

* places to start contributing (FTOs, etc) with a "Get involved" heading
* the "how to submit a module" (which could also have a header) to https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

BTW, the main README link to Contributing is broken now, i guess from when you moved to a separate CONTRIBUTING file.

This is looking super!
