Some ideas:

I love the presta valve idea (I used to work in a bike shop, and we threw many of these away each day from flats). I wonder if having a large metal post nearby would interfere with the conductivity measurements?

I'm jumping into the middle of the stopper vs. cap discussion without knowing much, but I like the flexibility of using caps, because of the fact that you can adapt the design to use with larger bottle openings, like the nalgene. Have you experimented with a design that has only cables passing through the cap? Cables could connect to whatever sensors or antennas the deployment is using, if fitting all the sensors on the cap is limiting.

For temperature sensors, do many uses require the sensitivity of having the sensor to be outside of the bottle? Because otherwise the temperature sensor could be attached to the inside of the bottle, assuming the bottle comes to equilibrium with the stream temperature fairly quickly, saving space on the outside.

Goodwill and other thrift stores can be great places to look for old nalgene bottles, and other wide mouthed plastic bottles. Sometimes these come from local losts-and-founds.
