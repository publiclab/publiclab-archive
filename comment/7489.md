The filter should have nothing to do with the difference in quality between the center and edge of the image since it is uniform in density.  Lenses, by their nature do not focus in a plane and thus this is one of the common quality measures for lenses.
F stop with film cameras effects depth of field.  Just like a pin hole camera, if the aperture is small enough the depth of field is infinite.  Thus if we had an infrared sensor with a pin hole for the lens it would be in focus automatically.  I do not know if these digital cameras that we are using physically change the aperture or algorithmically accomplish the equivalent.  What is needed is to determine 1) the focus algorithm, and 2) the aperture mechanism.
