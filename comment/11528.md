So it could be useful to point the camera at a scene with solid white pine trees on the left and mixed deciduous on the right and lawn at the bottom and then the images could be batch cropped for finer scale analysis. 

How about opening the window in summer? Finding a window that stays in the same place all year and never has a screen in front of it might be a problem here.

Are the photos saved to SD card? So anytime you want you can steal the SD card and dump the photos and return the card before the next scheduled photo? There is no live feed of the photos?

So anybody with a Pi and a Pi cam can grab your software and start collecting?

I guess I should make a 3D printed housing for the Pi. I have a couple of suction cups. Do you have the hardware plans in STL format (or Sketchup)?
