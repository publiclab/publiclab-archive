Both NDVI images look good. Both seem to have some biological meaning and both have reasonable NDVI values in areas that are shady which is very good. The dual photo result has some artifacts of high NDVI (magenta) at the bottom. If the histogram of the VIS photo is not stretched, the dual photo result does not have those extreme artifacts:

There will likely be lots of this type of variation in NDVI values and artifacts from one photo to the next and from one flight to the next. You will have to decide which workflow gives the most meaningful results and then be consistent.
