I want to highlight this awesome part of your blog post: 

The next step is to see if quantitative fluorescent measurements could be done by using another LED as a detector (http://www.instructables.com/id/LEDs-as-light-sensors/). This could allow for measurement of the oil in water for example. If you choose an LED with a green or red emission they have build in filters so a combination of a blue (405nm) LED and a green LED as a detector could be used to determine quantitatively the amount of oil in water. It looks like devices already exist that use LEDs to do this measurement. This may interest the publiclab community as the characterisation of the type of oil could be done with a low cost spectrometer and the concentration measured using the colorimeter.
