Nice project.  You say you measured absorbance at 500 nm in all your samples, but I noticed that your spectra were not calibrated -- there is no nm scale on the x axis.  How did you know which peak was 500 nm?  If you wanted to estimate concentration in an unknown coffee sample by measuring absorbance, could you just use the equation on your graph?
