I just tried this out-- I didn't find warm water alone effective, nor did I find just soaking in soapy water enough to remove the dye. 

I found that soapy warm water would only take a bit of the dye off at a time.  The best way I found was to alternate a quick rinse in soapy water with a quick rinse in warm water.  10x back and forth gave me a nice, clear DVD
