Nitrite is absorbed into red blood cells and combines with hemoglobin (oxygen-carrying molecule) to form methemoglobin. Methemoglobin cannot transport oxygen in the body, ultimately causing the animal to suffocate and die. However nitrite can change into nitric oxide, dilate your blood vessels, and lower blood pressure. 
Nitrite proved to be toxic to plants, however a good concentration of nitrates in the soil are a primary source of nutrients which is essential for plant growth. Under normal conditions nitrates are converted to protein in the plant at about the same rates as they are absorbed into the root system.
