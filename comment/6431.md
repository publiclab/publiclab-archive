Interesting experiments. Just be careful of the word "enhancement" as it is imprecise within this technical realm. Yes, averaging is useful (assuming the noise is gaussian and random) in reducing the visual errors caused by that noise. However, it can only give you an average. Another way to think of averaging is as a LPF (low pass filter) where you are removing (attenuating) the high-frequency information in the data. Yes, you can see the low frequency info more easily, but you are also eliminating sharp spectral lines (or reducing the amplitude of those lines) which thereby reduces the information about those spectral lines. Also realize that averaging does not ADD any new information -- i.e. is does not "enhance" the resolution of a measurement.
