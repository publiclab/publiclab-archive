I took a look at lesson three about IR light ([http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/public-lab-lesson-3-photography-in-a-new-light](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/public-lab-lesson-3-photography-in-a-new-light)) and made some comments in the talk tab. I assume nobody gets notified when this happens, so I thought I would alert you here. I guess there is no way to be alerted to changes in wiki pages, and no other way to comment on them. Sorry my comments are so late, especially since you are already burning pdfs from the wiki. I guess I could have just edited the wiki, but that seems rude and inappropriate. I also don't know who is correct about the issues I raise, but I'm pretty sure it's not the person who told you that some smart phone cameras don't have IR block filters.
