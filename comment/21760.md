[@joyofsoy](/profile/joyofsoy) thank you for your feedback!
 
Would it be useful to recommend you "users to follow" based on your tag preference first?

For example, let's say I follow air-quality

Should this page then start with: "other users that follow air-quality:"?

I'm still thinking about how best to display the map, and especially, how to link it with projects. What do you think of the current map on the /people page?

Thanks!
Eva
