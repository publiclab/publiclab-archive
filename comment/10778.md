[@warren](/profile/warren) - nope.

The database is pretty much the same, but I significantly changed the route mapping in order to take advantage of the resourceful routing built in to Rails.  The transition should be smooth once we transition 100% (b/c the database is pretty much the same), but it's going to be pretty tough to run my modifications alongside the existing MapKnitter.

I would recommend periodically making the new MapKnitter available on test.publiclab.org for beta testing when we implement new features, and then pushing it out wholesale once it's gone through enough beta testing.  I know it's a pain, but I felt that the potential in having a straightforward API that other Public Lab sites might use to draw on the content held by MapKnitter was compelling.

If you want me to merge the modifications that you've been making into my `annotations-interface` branch in order to keep the branches aligned, I can do that.
