Hi Chris, for the [upcoming "root mean square error" calibration "fitness" test](http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-30-2015/new-wavelength-calibration-procedure-preview-for-spectral-workbench-2-0), I want to sample not every single point, but all the peaks and troughs (to save time) and/or all the midpoints of plateaus and trough-plateaus. Were the points you used in your polynomial significant points? Just well-known peaks? What if I used all of those, and then the midpoints between them? Can you share which points you used?
