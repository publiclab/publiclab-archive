Seconded, from what i’ve Seen so far the Lego spectrometer is more suited to being a desktop spectrometer. You’d need to cart around a power source and a way to interface with the pi. The camera connector also comes out really easy so you’d need to find a way to fix everything in place. Mine it taped down to a small piece of board.
