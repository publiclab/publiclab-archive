hey guys..i am trying to do the same experiment but i am not getting any result. it seems that the uv light can't enter the spectrometer in order to detect it by the camera. does the type of sample container matter to detect uv. And why the laser is not pointed directly to spectrometer kit? i put it in the same direction as it is in the picture but no signal at all unless if i pointed directly to camera and the sample is in between. 
Thanks in advance
