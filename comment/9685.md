I was unaware of the bug before Jeff mentioned but it is occurring each time after a few distorts. I am not sure why that is happening because the same piece of code is running each time. Will try to sort that out.

Will work on transparency, scaling and image dragging once the zoom event and the bug gets rectified.

[@btbonval](/profile/btbonval) - thanks for pointing out github pages. Wanted to know if it has any advantage over usual VPSs? Btw the source code for index.html on the server corresponds to the file 1.html on the github repo: https://github.com/anishshah101/ImageDistortLeaflet/blob/master/1.html . The repo is slightly unorganized, will sort that out as well.
