Hm, i wonder what's going on -- I do think it's a bug. I see both have an actual image esp when i look at https://spectralworkbench.org/profile/sarahc

I wonder if somehow the pixel values are some strange range so it's moving the image off the edge of the visible region...? Looking in here to see if that could be true:

https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/latest/136078.json

Ah yes - so for whatever reason it's saying the image has width of zero:

`<img class="spectrum" src="/system/photos/136078/original/capture.png" style="width: 0px; max-width: none; margin-left: -1082.7px;">`

So i think maybe you need to re-upload it? The original image is still stored here: 

![spectrum](https://spectralworkbench.org/system/photos/136078/original/capture.png)
