Thanks Warren, (1) is there any specific filter that I can use to fix overcompensation of the light in your experience? maybe that will help in increasing color accuracy (like a filter that is known to subdues all colors equally? so I can double or triple fold it depending on the overexposure) (2) how about removing IR filer? what effect could that have on my color issue (other than being able to see more IR and/or UV light)
