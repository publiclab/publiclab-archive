Fuel contaminated water affected the residents of Camp Lejeune. The camp violated the Clean Water Act because people knew there were carcinogenic chemicals in the water, and nothing was done about it. As a result, there is a class action lawsuit in affect. In 1972, congress passed the Clean Water Act to remove toxic substances from the water.
