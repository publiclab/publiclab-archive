Hi, Stephen - just checking in again because (now-named) Leaflet.DistortableImage has matured a great deal, and is about to be used in coming days in the launch of MapKnitter 2. We are not quite at a 1.0 release, but have collected just a few bugs and oddities which we'd like to resolve, here: https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/milestones/Version%200.1.0%20release

However, it works quite well on most modern browsers and tablets/smartphones, and can handle many dozens of images smoothly, and the UI is maturing quickly, esp. in the MapKnitter 2 application.
