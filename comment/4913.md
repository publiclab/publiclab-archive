If you adjust the white balance on the infrablue photo, or make any other changes to the color balance, you will get different NDVI values. By trial and error you can get NDVI values that make more sense. Whether the new NDVI image will be useful data is less clear. I guess you could start by adjusting the color so the photo looks more yellow like other infrablue photos. Maybe that will make the NDVI image look more meaningful.
