The camera can't distinguish between NIR and other wavelengths, so it assumes that light getting to the blue pixels is mostly blue, light hitting the red pixels is mostly red, etc. Custom white balance adjusts the total amount of light being saved in each channel with the goal of producing a normal-looking color photo, even when the color balance is not normal (e.g., fluorescent light). Each camera's algorithm takes into account the particular color filter array over the pixels (e.g., Bayer filter) and also the characteristics of the IR block filter and lens coatings. With the IR block filter removed and an infrablue or super-red filter in the path, the custom white balance algorithm produces nonsense results. We exploit that by flooding the sensor with a particular color of light which establishes a custom setting which emphasizes a particular proportion of red, green, and blue. The fact that we get pretty good results when [custom white balance is done with single color LEDs](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/11-22-2013/white-balance-for-all) suggests that all we are doing is establishing a setting which emphasizes whichever channel we are using for NIR (e.g., infrablue cameras white-balanced with a blue LED emphasize the red channel, super-red cameras white-balanced with a red LED emphasize the blue channel). The single color (R, G, or B)  LEDs apparently emit little or no NIR light, so during the white balance process the camera just sees that one channel is getting lots of light (which happens to be visible light).  This has been investigated with CCD cameras, but not CMOS cameras. CMOS cameras seem to have more NIR light in all the channels when the IR block filter is removed. Much more testing is called for to figure out how to get good NDVI results from single camera (infrablue or super-red) CMOS systems.
