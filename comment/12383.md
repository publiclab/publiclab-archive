Hi Rich - I'll look into this. I think I know what the problem is but the fix isn't easy. Dealing with the EXIF data has been a bit of a nightmare. The EXIF read error seems unrelated but I'll look into that too. For what it's worth a colleague of mine is working on a Python version and that will hopefully be easier to modify and maintain. He's also a very good programmer and I am definitely not. I'm not sure what that will be available but I'll post a notice as a research note.

If possible can you send me some test images - maybe 2 pairs. You can contact me at horning@amnh.org. I can't recreate the EXIF problem with my images.
