Bluefin tuna has been the most desired for human consumption. The bluefin tuna is part of the aquatic biome. Due to it being one of the most desired fish it is at risk. The bluefin tuna population has reduced by 95%. Simply us consuming too much of it gives the food chain a chance to self-destruct.  Biodiversity is a variety in the same natural habitat and ecosystem. It is a measure of variation at the genetic, species, and ecosystem level. So, when a species population reduces it puts all the other animals in that habitat or biome at risk of reducing as well. That is why biodiversity is very important. Itâ€™s connection to the food chain provides sustained life support for all biotic organisms through overall genetic diversity and food security. We can protect biodiversity by decreasing the waste for consumers goods and making sure the products we buy minimize biodiversity.
