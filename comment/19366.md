Hi [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) -- thank you so much for asking these questions. Here's what i know -- <br>

- Nick has to go to Georgia with a working solution in 2 weeks. 

- This solution is a secondary, real-time test serving as a comparison with the new badge that's part of the SmartForm workflow https://publiclab.org/wiki/smart-form. 
- There is only one "4000 Series Digital Portable Analyzer" (https://www.gasdetection.com/wp-content/uploads/4000_series_digital.pdf) in need of connection to a data logger. 
- this HCHO analyzer is on loan to Nick, he's never used it before. 
- The sensor itself is battery powered, the manual explains that there are two types of batteries, some NiCad (needing recharge via a power cord) and some alkaline (not rechargable). 
- the data logger seems like it could be powered any way you like, as all measurements will be conducted indoors and we can expect electricity to be available in wall sockets.
