[@xose](/profile/xose) [@imvec](/profile/imvec) [@sarasage](/profile/sarasage) - I'm really interested in how these layers can help inform and support local environmental projects. I noticed that if you zoom into Val Verde, where [@sarasage](/profile/sarasage) and others are working, the wind direction is helpful but not that great -- you have to zoom out a bit to see a nearby weather station.

I'm wondering two things --

1. are there sources of better or more local wind data? Or if folks hooked up weather stations, would it be possible to get that data to show up?
2. what about sources of groundwater flow direction data?
3. are there sources of data for landfills, since although it's great to see petroleum, power, and water infrastructure on this map, the [Chiquita landfill](https://goo.gl/maps/MetDJiVEza92) doesn't appear? Does OpenStreetMap have an API for us to show points identified as landfills?
