Hi, I think you're right that you need to adjust the white balance, and you can learn more about how that works here: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-23-2017/change-the-white-balance-or-other-configuration-on-a-mobius-camera

However, you can do some to adjust the channels you receive to simulate white balance adjustments using Infragram.org. Since your blue channel was hugely overexposed, I tried just dimming that channel to see what we get, using this expression:

Grey: `(R-(B-0.75))/(R+B)`

That resulted in this image (starting with your blueish photo above):

[![Screen_Shot_2021-12-06_at_12.21.36_PM.png](/i/45170)](/i/45170?s=o)

There are some issues with it - the shadows are overemphasized, for one. I think if you wanted more confidence, you could compare it to a really well white-balanced version, even from another camera, but once you establish the GoPro's limitations, you could then use it with those caveats. 

It also looks like /some/ gopros do have white balance -- https://community.gopro.com/t5/en/White-Balance-Setting-Information/ta-p/390203 -- in case that's helpful.
