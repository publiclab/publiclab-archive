Don thinks that eight seconds might be the minimum interval during which the system can be put into deep sleep. So all the sleep stuff happens in multiples of eight seconds. But it must take some time to do some housekeeping (writing data, turning out the lights, getting under the covers), so the timestamps on the data writes from this overnight deployment were mostly close to 10 seconds apart.

When you want to log data every 10 minutes, I guess the housekeeping chores will only happen once every ten minutes, so dividing 10 minutes by eight seconds will get you the proper multiplier. We will see.
