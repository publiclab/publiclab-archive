Hi [@patalbright](/profile/patalbright),
A couple of things
1. Use whit Styrofoam as a reference white, try to find one that's Matt and not glossy.
2. The light source you have here looks like an LED, it hardly have any power in the over 700 nm range of the spectrum, to really take advantage of NDVI you'd want to use illumination with more power in the IR. Cinsider possibly adding light from an incandescent lamp.
