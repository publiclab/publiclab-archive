these are great! thanks you leslie! Also just found this: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/clairy-the-most-amazing-natural-air-purifier-green#/ they've raked in $338,640 they use a large computer fan and i think also normal soil (not hydroculture that allows for better airflow).

so i am not convinced that the roots would get the ventilation they need. they also used insanely small chamber studies for their science. I've requested the full report from the testers. There was a huge scuffle in the 90s about plant purification based upon small chamber tests and extrapolations from them. the epa weighed in against their validity. I'll try to dig up those studies. The clay is beautiful though!
