I was assuming that the best way to preserve image quality when removing a glass filter would be to replace it with another glass filter. Plastic, gelatin, or film filters are not the same thickness, do not have optically smooth surfaces, may not be flat, and may not be internally homogeneous (film and sometimes plastic filters have layers). All those things could influence image clarity. I was also very impressed with the quality of the Superblue photos from Ned's Canon G11 with a glass BG3 filter inside, and was naively hoping to match that with the small sensor and lens of the A2200. 

There is some chromatic aberration evident in some of these photos -- a faint blue ghost on the outside edge of objects near the edge of Wratten 25A photos. Further investigation is warranted.
