> How can I add a Marker on the Location (lat, long coordinates)? Right now I am could view the exact area of the place but I don't know where I am exactly.

I think you can start a map using latitude and longitude. Maybe we should open an issue at https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter to show the center-of-window coordinates somewhere useful? 

> How it is feasible to add images in the form of a shape? (Arrow, Line or letters)

Oh, interesting. I'm not quite sure, but you can upload PNGs with alpha transparency, if that helps?

> How I can Embed Code?

Ah, embed a MapKnitter map on another page? There is an Embed button in the sidebar that generates the code!

> Can I import CSV files (Google My Maps, Open source maps) with pre-defined Lat Long areas?

Ah, like to show other maps overlaid? Can you share an example map you'd like to do this with? It could be another good MapKnitter feature. 

> Is it good to stitch images captured from Good Camera or Phone Camera?

For this, probably check out https://publiclab.org/camera-selection

I hope this helps!!
