Thanks! 
I am interested in working on the Leaflet environmental layers project. Will I have to work in all the features or I can choose which ones to implement?  I have some ideas for some of the issues. I have worked with open layers and mapnik for the visualization of vector and raster layers, regarding meteorological data, and with leaflet for the visualization of tracks and points in a map.
