Hey [@a1ahna](/profile/a1ahna) and [@nviollier](/profile/nviollier), 

Looks like this post is several months old by now but I'd be interested in connecting about this! I'm also hoping to start working with fungi and mycoremediation. I've only ever cultivated oyster mushrooms for food before but would be thrilled about starting more experiments. 

By the way, is the fungi book club still going on?
