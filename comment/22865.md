I was looking for some pre-cut smaller pieces of copper in standard sizes, in part to avoid the warping that cutting big sheets with shears can cause. I found these copper stamping blanks that have 2 holes predrilled:

They're $13 for 10, so $1.30 each, and the holes could make it easier to mount them. 

But what's best is that they have a protective film coating -- designed for stamping through with letters and numbers. I was thinking that potentially this could be removed when you want to start the test, presenting a consistent surface at least the first time... but in any case preserving the surface even before you sand it down and acetone it as per Gretchen's documented method: (#15142)

They're 1"x2" with rounded corners:
