Thanks [@mathew](/profile/mathew)! Has certainly been an adventure. Only consistent issue has been school internet security protocols- they treat the Raspberry Pi as an unknown device and block the posts. Fortunately we have been able to find a workaround at both schools. 

I was planning on blogging about the results, but there has not been anything particularly concerning thus far! I am trying to figure out if the monitor is placed in the wrong place, or maybe the buses are just not putting out that much PM2.5. Trying to do the same thing with a NO2/CO sensor as well, but I am having a hard time finding one that is accurate and reasonably priced. Monitor currently located about 100 feet from bus dropoff/pickup.
