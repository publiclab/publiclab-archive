[@DavidMack](/profile/DavidMack) posted on sticky pads a while back on the [#particle-sensing](/tag/particle-sensing) page:  

> Essentially tape, sticky pads have the advantage of capturing a record of actual particles that can be analyzed later.  They can be scanned and digitized for standardized readings. More can be found on the [Sustainable Aggregates ](http://www.sustainableaggregates.com/sourcesofaggregates/landbased/dust/dust_monitoring.htm) website.
