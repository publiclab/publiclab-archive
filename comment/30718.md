The Nitrogen Cycle’s Decomposition Process:
Fixation - The first part of the nitrogen’s decomposition process is fixation. It converts nitrogen gas (N2) into a more usable form.
Assimilation - Is the absorption and digestion of food or nutrients by the body or any biological system. This relates to nitrogen because plants must absorb it in order to use it.
Decomposition – Next is decomposition which is the breaking down of organic matter. This is done through bacteria and fungi.
Ammonification – In this part of the nitrogen cycle, organisms receive essential nitrogen for survival. This is done through turning nitrogen compounds into ammonia. 
Nitrification - When ammonia is converted to nitrite by nitrifying bacteria. The plants can more easily absorb this nitrogen compound. 
Denitrification – The last step in the nitrogen cycle. This is where denitrifying bacteria or the act of leaching sends nitrogen gas back into the atmosphere.
