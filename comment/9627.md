I think a lot of the challenge of using an Infragram camera well is the need for comparison. Comparing an area treated in one way with a "control" area in the same image can work, or comparing some parts of your lawn to others if some get water-stressed faster.

Measuring one spot over time can be more challenging, as the camera settings and light conditions may change. But I wonder if you could build on [@nedhorning](/profile/nedhorning)'s work with calibration cards (http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/07-10-2014/using-a-raw-image-to-calibrate-a-jpeg-image, http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/05-01-2014/improved-diy-nir-camera-calibration) to correct data over time. I like the idea of correlating with moisture sensors. Low NDVI can be an indicator of water stress, i believe.
