[@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) Creating the new library Leaflet blurred location display , we can have new-comers-issues in both the repos as we did last year. And once they get the taste of these libraries they can continue to join plots2 repo as well. I can create some issues with steps to solve them as well. Something like this https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location/issues/9.
