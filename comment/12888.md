Thanks [@ethanbass](/profile/ethanbass) !  I can't remember which of my tries was with the plastic bag, maybe 4 and 5.  I also tried the paper but set it up with the light shining onto the paper and the spectrometer also pointing at the same side of the paper (kinda in a triangle).  Not sure why but it didn't occur to me to put the paper between to the light and spectrometer -- I'll give it a try and hopefully that works!
