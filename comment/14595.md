[@stevie](/profile/stevie) With respect to the user reputation/badging system we can use points according to the number of questions/answers and the number of upvotes on them. That would aid to the Rich Profile of the user. Instead of a something like an "expert" or "begineer" we can just use the number of reputations that would reflect  the activity of the user in the community.
