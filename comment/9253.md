Jenny, sorry if my note isn't clear. I used Meshmixer to “close” the bottom of the earth mound feature. The screenshots and captions illustrate the steps in the Meshmixer process. I expect Blender has these kinds of capabilities, but I found the learning curve steep and used Meshmixer instead. If, after looking over the screenshots and captions, want to go over it. Let me know. My email is pat@coyles.com if want to follow up offpage.
