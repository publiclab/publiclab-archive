  Thanks for this incredibly valuable input as to the potential for measuring extracted volumes and  stored piles on the property via 3D image capture. I will link this conversation to Ted Auch from FracTracker Alliance, who may be very interested (or perhaps already knows!) in it's uses.
  Now... I'd imagine that many of the ignorant (meaning myself) throughout history never thought to check the gas tank when opening up the hood of the stalled/"broken" vehicle...that said, your MUCH simpler motion sensor camera idea of doing a sand-hauling semi count would be another such moment in my prodigious career! ( I think I'll take this easy approach, since I LIVE RIGHT ON THE ROAD close to the Sand mining exit)
  Humbly, your input has been very much appreciated.
