I have learned that the Clean Water Act of 1972 was created so that people should only be given safe drinking water. In Camp Lejune, there was a class action lawsuit because of a violation on the act. Like all military bases, marines believed to be in the safest place with the safest food and water. However, there was fuel that intoxicated the water that the residents were given. The government knew they were being given carcinogenic water but didn’t do anything about it.
