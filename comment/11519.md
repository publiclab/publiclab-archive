Hi bhickman, I'm working on this project right now, and I'm kind of lost with the energia code and the processing code from your github page, mainly because I'm new to coding and i'm trying to figure this thing out. Could you assist me in finding a starting point to inputing the code you have on the github page for the processing GUI?
