That looks like a hollow cathode lamp.  We used perkin elmer, not fisher, so there could be differences.  The lamp should have the element it can detect stamped on it.  There are also multi-element lamps, in which case you will have several elements in the label.  That is, you could analyze several elements with the same lamp. The operating current is listed at the bottom.  SOP was always to go with the  lowest current that would give good results.  As the lamp aged, the current would need to be increased.   We were told the voltage was high, but never the exact level.  To give an idea, the first AA we had, used neon as the other gas in the hollow cathode lamp.  It made alignment easier (you would get a neon red beam to align with).  But that suggests that the voltage is at least 90 volts,if not higher.
