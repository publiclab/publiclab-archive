Hi Shanlter,

That's a good question. There is no 5V-out pin on the Riffle, but there is a "VBAT" pin on the 2x7 pin header. I assume that pin carries the voltage of the battery that powers the Riffle. The Riffle can be powered by batteries with 3.5 to 6 volts. If you use a 5V to 6V battery, the VBAT pin should supply about 5V. I don't know if this current is regulated.
