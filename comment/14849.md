Could you please share me the source code to measure Ozone level in the air. I want to calculate the concentration in ppb.
At the moment, I just get the value that read from analog pin.
Moreover,you proposed the circuit with 820 ohm and 10K Ohm. But in this link, you request to add 100K Ohm, which one is correct?
