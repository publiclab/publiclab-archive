Access the Demo - 
All you need to do is go to the Member's Login page, and type demo for the Email Address (there's no password). This will access the FTIRsearch.com account member's area, but it will only allow you to search the smaller demo database. When you log in under a demo account, it will be filled automatically with a fixed number of FTIRsearch.com credits. As you search the database, search charges will be deducted from the demo account balance in the same manner as they would be for account members. However, the member account management features are disabled and you cannot "purchase" more credits while logged in to a demo account.
