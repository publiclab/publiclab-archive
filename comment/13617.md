Hi Parth,

The three methods of computing NDVI all do the same thing. They do the same math (NIR-VIS)/(NIR+VIS) on each pixel. They are equally reliable if you know how to use them.

- The colors assigned to the NDVI values may differ among the three methods.  
- Only the Photo monitoring plugin for Fiji allows you to stretch the histogram.  
- Fiji has powerful tools for post processing the NDVI images.  
- Infragram.or does not require any software on your computer other than a browser.
