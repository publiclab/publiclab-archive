Yeah, I did see that the goal is to be able to compare different wavelengths on the same light source.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding something, but let me try to be more clear about what I meant.

Consider you take a spectrum of some imaginary simple light source that gives off light at two wavelengths, 600nm and 500nm, and it gives off twice as much 600nm light as 500nm light.  You calibrate your spectrometer so that it shows the 600nm peak twice as high as the 500nm peak.  If you then change the overall intensity of the light source (for example, move the spectrometer closer or farther away), the webcam will automatically scale the readings it gives for each peak logarithmically, not linearly, so the 600nm peak will no longer be twice as high as the 500nm peak.  If you increase the intensity of the source, the webcam will show the lower peak increasing faster than the higher peak, and vice versa.

Does that make sense?

This is the reason I think we have to try to get raw data from the webcam.
