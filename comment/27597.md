Hi! I appreciate your looking into finer grained details of the UI design, such as the `...` menu in the note cards, and things like that! One great resource is the draft Style Guide, linked to from https://publiclab.org/style-guide - check it out for conventions and ideas related to page designs across the site!

Thanks for your proposal!
