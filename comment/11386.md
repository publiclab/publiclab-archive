Jeff, almost no translating of images. Along the pier, mostly just auto-place, scale and rotate. I just had message to re-export, so am trying again. Looking at map, you can see alignment isn't perfect, but I thought it was very impressive. I've got some other stuff today, but can try to post screen capture of what the images look like when they're auto-placed but not adjusted.
