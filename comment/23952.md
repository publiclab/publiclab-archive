 I'm not sure if this method would be helpful for sampling things like heavy metals or pesticides, as we're just looking at microbiome data. The the lab is going to extract and sequence all of the dna found in the dust, and from that figure out what species of bacteria and fungi species are present and in what concentrations. At this stage I would recommend for people interested in using this tool to post comments here rather than contact the labs directly so we can all figure out what makes sense together.  This post came a day or two after first field trialing it, so once we move from sampling to analysis and data processing I can better weigh-in on what questions, timelines, sample quantities, budgets, etc are suited for using this tool and contacting a lab. So I guess i'm saying, for me the question isn't how do I contact a lab but what are folk's goals and resources and from there its easier to figure out if this tool is helpful and if they should contact a lab.
