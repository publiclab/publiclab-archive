Hi Suman - The values from 0 - 1 have been scaled from the original image. The reason I do this is that some image pixel values range from 0 - 255 but others can be between 0 - 1024 or 0 - 2048 for example. If you wanted to scale an image from 0 - 255 to 0 - 1 you could use this formula: 
Pixel_value * 1/255
Another point is that if you only have two targets then the R2 will always be 1 or very close to 1 even if the actual fit between pixel values and ground reluctance is not very strong.
