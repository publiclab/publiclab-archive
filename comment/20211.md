Excited about this! I really like these ideas, especially **featuring people more prominently.** One of my favorite things on the whole site that perhaps i'd like to consider keeping as-is is the lead image and text from the wiki that loads side-by-side at the top of tag pages. The sketch shows an expansion of that header information that takes up more "real estate" that i feel is unnecessary. It would be great for a designer to think carefully about how we suggest that people follow tags that they are interested in -- a critical step! Tags are very important for how Public Lab community organizes knowledge, but i feel their functions may not be widely understood.
