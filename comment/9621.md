Thanks Stu... I just wanted to see if added sugar is detectable first. If yes, you can may be measure the sugar levels during wine making process as well, right? Or chose the appropriate grapes to start with... Also, "no added sugar" labels on juices may not be true :) You can catch them too...Also, may be differentiate different sugars or sweeteners, or may be even detect some other additives in juices...May be it is possible to detect honey adulteration with sugar and/or syrup as well... It was just a humble start :)
