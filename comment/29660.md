Microplastics are extremely small particles of plastic waste that can come from plastic waste that has eroded into smaller pieces, or pieces of plastic that were originally designed to be small. 
In our area marine plastic pollution can be found in both normal plastic pollution in the form of plastic packaging, and microplastic waste in the from of nurdles and broken up pieces of larger plastics
