Hi Lot,
Been working on an alternative to mailing the photos; in which case I am implementing your proposal to have them streamed to another phone. I think this will make much more sense as the photos will be accessible much swiftly.

I would also so much appreciate a few images from you for testing purposes, as I will have close to real tests. 

Thanks for the comparison you made between photos got from the Samsung S3 and those from the Xperia SL... Just confirming, did you mean better in terms of clarity or other factors are in play too?

[@patcoyle](/profile/patcoyle), hi
Quite a nice idea of adding trigger for CHDK external cameras. However, this will be a little bit tough since I currently lack the hardware to enable me see this through in terms of accessing the cam's firmware and testing. ANy workarounds on this that you might have?
