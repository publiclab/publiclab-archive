 One item tried in industry was to take good quality water and run them through filters small enough to stop microbes ( the last I heard, about 0.2 microns, but it Could have gone smaller).  This was sold as a time saver over the normal approach.  But it didn't work.  Might be a viable approach , if you weren't in a hurry.
