Hi Hagit, 

I don't have any research notes related to community mapping. Most of my involvement is peripheral, providing input into methods and helping with data collection protocols and image mapping. The project we are developing will try to go beyond the more traditional practice of developing conservation priorities primarily using bio-physical data and largely ignoring human land use and values or assuming they could be modified to fit the conservation goals. The specific goals and objectives for this project are still being worked out. 

My “toolbox” of community mapping ideas largely comes from work other folks are doing. I put some guides/case studies on my ftp site: ftp://ftp.amnh.org/pub/people/horning/ParticipatoryMapping. You might be familiar with many of these documents but I point you to them so you have an idea of my, largely “in the box”, perspective of community mapping.  

I am not familiar with the UCL Congo project but it looks similar to other projects I'm familiar with. That project isn't that far off. I was supposed to be in the DRC (the other Congo) at this time helping with a community forest project but I couldn't fit it into my schedule.
