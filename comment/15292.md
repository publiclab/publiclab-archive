Hi Rebeccah!

Fantastic stuff here.  Lots to digest, and I have several thoughts -- but first, quickly:  the frequency output of the Coqui requires using a special trick for measuring pulse counts.  I dug up some older code for logging the frequency using pin 3 on the Riffle, and put it just now into a Github repository:

https://github.com/dwblair/riffle-freq-logger

To use it, you need to copy the libraries in the "arduino_libraries" folder into your Arduino sketchbook/libraries folder, and you need to connect the output of your Coqui circuit to Riffle pin 3

And yes, also keeping in mind (thanks Chris) that the protoboard has its pins labeled incorrectly -- the two rows of pin labels are switched :)

The idea, then, is that the frequency should be proportional to the conductivity of the solution.  

We've learned in the last months, though, that there are some big caveats around trying to use the Coqui circuit for measuring conductivity --  the voltage that the circuit puts in the water (3.3V) is likely too high for making good conductivity measurements over time;  the circuit behavior is also asymmetric in its voltage oscillations in the water, which will tend to polarize the solution, affecting the measurement.  There are other issues, too -- all of which probably make it an unreliable conductivity sensor for longer-term deployment in the field. 

But: it looks like you've got a really good setup there for testing conductivity probe and circuit designs, and it would still be very interesting to see how well the Coqui does in your setup.  If you're able to get a reasonably consistent relationship between frequency and conductivity, the Coqui might at least be useful as a 'handheld probe'.   It's probably not worth trying to use it in the field for longer-term measurements, because of those known problems with the circuit.  (That said, its accuracy has never been tested in the field in a systematic way).  

Really cool enclosure and probe design!

If you're interested in trying the above code and run into any trouble (it's not very well commented), let me know.

Cheers!
Don
