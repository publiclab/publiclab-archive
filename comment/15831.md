The angle is a function of (mathematical) of the detectable wavelength range and the diffraction grating (DVD) line spacing. My calculations and my published Matlab plots show that 45-deg is a good match to the 400-700nm range of sensitivity of a webcam. This makes the mounting alignment easy -- the DVD is mounted close and parallel to the camera lens and that 'sub-asssembly' is then aligned at 45-deg to the light from the slit. The alignment angle tolerance is also a function of the camera optics.

The cheapy webcams (with the tiny, low-f lenses) result in the spectral band occupying only about 'half' of the camera's "pixel-span" so alignment "feels" very insensitive. However, that is partially an illusion because as the spectral band (say 400-650nm) is 'adjusted' in "left-right position" within the camera frame, the wavelength span will no longer be 'centered' which will add some non-linearity to the otherwise linear approximation for CFL wavelength calibration.

So, I built my spectrometers using 45-degs so as to 'center' the 400-650nm band where the mid-point 525nm "ray" will be orthogonal to the plane of the image sensor thus making the image symmetrical.

So, from a practical aspect, and with tiny webcam lenses, there is plenty of image area so you'll easily get a full spectrum even if the angle is off a little bit -- but it's still good to understand where the numbers come from when making trade-offs.

[ I'm guessing that the '60-deg / 45-deg' combination came purely from fiddling with the parts or perhaps from an effort to view more of one end of the spectrum. While a webcam (sans IR filter) does detect some infrared, relative to the center 550nm green spectral sensitivity, the IR sensitivity out past 700nm is quickly in the noise. (Yes, if the signal has very little visible wavelengths, then you can 'push' the IR detection but amplitude accuracy past 700nm is very  poor and noisy.) ]
