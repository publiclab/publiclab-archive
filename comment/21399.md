Leslie, I will lend you anything you need. Tell me about your HEPA setup. You must already have a 5V Arduino, so all you need is three DuPont wires to connect a Plantower sensor and display readings on the serial monitor. If you want to log data, I think you have an [RTC and SD module](https://publiclab.org/n/14901) so all you need is a Plantower. Until Trump pulls out of the UPU, it doesn't cost much more to order a Plantower on eBay than to pay USPS to get mine to you. Then you can test your HEPA fan till the dust settles.
