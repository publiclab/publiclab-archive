There is a LOT in this post; first, thank you Dave for a very thorough analysis!

I'm sure I'll have more to add, but to start with, a clarification:

> each of these samples, and the selectable attenuation, were adjusted to minimize the measurement dynamic range

I'm understanding from this that you diluted them AND dimmed the spectra fluorescence with an attenuator in order to get the peak heights closer. Is that right?
