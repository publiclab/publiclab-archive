Just testing out the idea we discussed about entering data directly from an arduino (emulating a keyboard) into a graph on the site!

[graph:data:text/csv,column1,column2,column3
1,2,3
1,2,3
2,3,4
5,7,7]

Attempt 2:

[graph:data:text/csv,column1,column2,column3\n1,2,3\n1,2,3\n2,3,4\n5,7,7]

The second attempt worked! 

`[graph:data:text/csv,column1,column2,column3\n1,2,3\n1,2,3\n2,3,4\n5,7,7]`

We could set up a webapp to collect this, deal with the tab vs. comma issues and the newlines, and then open a research note with your data, like:

`https://publiclab.org/post?body=[graph:data:text/csv,column1,column2,column3\n1,2,3\n1,2,3\n2,3,4\n5,7,7]`
