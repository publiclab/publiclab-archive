Hi Ned,

I am really excited about the work you are doing here as it helps resolve some major issues with my grad studies. I have a few questions:

* When I view the jpeg EXIF in Irfanview, I see "max aperture" but not simply "aperture". Is there a way to determine if my images have identical aperture?
* I am looking at this as a method to resolve our lack of RAW images. I am planning to use your workflow, then use the calibration function of Pix4D when generating a reflectance map. Is this a good idea? In the future, I will shoot RAW, convert to Tif, and let Pix4D do its thing. 
* How many pixels are needed to calibrate? Since we do not have pre-flight images of the target, we are stuck with a roughly 20x20 pixel ROI. 
*Would you be able to post your R scripts for gamma correction?

Thanks for all the effort you put into this. It's great to see opensource processing receive features that proprietary software seems to lack.
