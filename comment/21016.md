A couple of clarifying questions:

- do you have a time period in mind for sampling before data collection/processing?  

- do you have any form limitations? eg dimensional limits, a consideration if you are sampling in existing sampling wells. 

- accuracy/repeatability requirements? 

The first two are somewhat minor, but the last question will really help focus the selection of sensors. dave
