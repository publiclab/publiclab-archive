the authors did two levels of survey-- first the 6 minute 'snapshots' and then they used that to determine where to place passive monitors for long-term characterization.  The second heat map is based multi-week monitoring at each site, using 7-day passive samples.  So lower temporal resolution, but capturing the week-to-week average exposure hotspots.

Temporal variation is a big deal, but here they were just trying to demonstrate a means of characterizing spacial variability on the cheap using monitors that don't require power.
