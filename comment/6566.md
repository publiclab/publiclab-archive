Yes, I could print a couple sheets but it would be best to decide on the best pattern and density if you're looking to send something along the lines of your 50-0-50 concept.

Just a guess, but I suspect you won't get the same results with a laser printer. Lasers are extremely high contrast so designed for layout graphics and text, not photographs. The inkjet is capable of printing at 2400 dpi which means it creates very high tonality resolution -- which is why it is good for photographs. Since the camera is focused on the slit and the filter is also located there, the neutral-density filter needs to be uniform at any grey level -- i.e. not something the camera can focus on as an image.

Any additional thoughts on pattern layout, form-factor and density for cut-pieces to send out for Alpha testing?
