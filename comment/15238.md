This is one of the largest merges I've been involved in, and in retrospect I think it may be good to be more careful and not merge master branch code into a feature branch before a final rebase -- the intermixing of commits led to some difficulties we could maybe have avoided if we'd just done one clear run-through as a rebase, and avoided any merge commits at all. Or tried to break it into smaller pieces and done a series of smaller rebase/merges instead of just two giant ones. But we're doing pretty well, and I'm sure we'll figure it out!
