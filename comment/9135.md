Hello Fra! I am glad to hear you have been giving aerial mapping a try. The hand-made kites I mentioned are by Dan Leigh, a UK-based kite builder (http://www.deltas.freeserve.co.uk/) - you can find out in his website what kind of kite you need based on wind conditions, etc (http://www.deltas.freeserve.co.uk/windspeed.html). One of the kites we flew in Perugia was made by him and it was specially crafted for low winds - it is a modification of the R7 (http://www.deltas.freeserve.co.uk/catalog.html). He also has information about reels and kite lines in his website (http://www.deltas.freeserve.co.uk/linewind.html).

Public Lab sells kite kits (with two kites - one for low and one for high wind speeds but no reel, instructions, gloves, or attachements - http://store.publiclab.org/collections/mapping/products/kite-mapping-pack) as well as all in one balloon and kite mapping kits (http://store.publiclab.org/collections/mapping/products/all-in-one-balloon-and-kite-mapping-kit). Take a look at their products page to get and idea of what you might need to get your mapping project going (http://store.publiclab.org/collections/mapping).
You could also check out the Public Lab website on kites for more information about making/buying kites: http://publiclab.org/wiki/kite-mapping.

A must visit page for tips on kite mapping: http://publiclab.org/wiki/kite-mapping-tips
And if you are planning a collaborative mapping effort, check out a"dvanced decision-support tool for selecting optimal participatory mapping method": http://publiclab.org/notes/JirkaPanek/06-03-2014/aramani-advanced-decision-support-tool-for-selecting-optimal-participatory-mapping-method

I hope this helps and please do keep in touch! Let us know how it goes here in Public Lab - post your notes and tell us how things have worked or not for you so we can also learn from you.
Cheers!
