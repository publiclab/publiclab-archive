Hi! I'm not familiar with how a seminar works are your school, but it sounds interesting! Would this happen during the summer? I do like to see a plan for how proposals will incorporate efforts to welcome new people into the work, to build a bigger community with more capacity. This is one reason we try to break things up so much -- easier to engage people on tasks that are clearly defined and self-contained. 

As to OAuth, I think there are a few things I want to understand well:

* what happens if someone logs in once with FB and then with Twitter? Would OmniAuth enable them to both access the same account?
* what about when someone has an account already but then wants to log in via FB -- would it create a distinct account?
* if duplicate accounts get made, is there a way to merge accounts?
* once accounts are created, can we use them to generate the "social media" user tags shown on profiles? (this should be pretty easy)
* Would we be able to link or import Twitter or FB content to PL.org? There's been some good discussion on "comment via Twitter" -- take a look at other discussion on [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet)'s proposal: https://publiclab.org/notes/sagarpreet/02-16-2018/social-media-integration-and-part-of-interactive-project-maps (you don't have to implement this, but just be aware of some of the complimentary ideas in others' proposals!)

I hope this is helpful! Also note you have a line saying you'll be adding mockups, which sounds great (although not required!) but if you decide not to add them, probably you should remove that before submitting. :-)

Thank you!
