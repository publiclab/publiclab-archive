[@stoft--I](/profile/stoft--I) think that is a very good summary of the articles that [@liz](/profile/liz) and [@warren](/profile/warren) posted as references.  It is also a good reason to at least _try_ to create a system that supports PLab's mission.  

Some of the "give" to create a balanced system will have to come from both sides of the spectrum, I suspect.  To keep expanding on the "citizen scientist" (sorry--I'm still looking for a better term) participation, it should be pretty open for people to use and post results.

At the same time, however, good science (both as a process and as a goal) would seem to require a way to boost well-done research and at least flag or notify something that is questionable.

I'm kind of warming up to the weighted review idea--it also works for replication and verifications (just two other types of reviews).  There are a lot of fiddly details that would need to be worked out, but the final arbiters would the PublicLab folks.
