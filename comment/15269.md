`Maybe if I designate one type (1/4" ID) for use with the dowels and the other (5/16" ID) for use with the tubing that would be easier to follow?`  
When I was attaching the tubing clamps I didn't know whether they were for dowels or tubing, so that designation would not be so helpful. If I had known there were three types of clamp, and had the diagrams always designated which type, I would have figured it out.

`most of the parts in the kit are duplicates`  
That's true, so my snark about all the parts was somewhat unjustified. This kit is "reconfigurable" mostly  because you can build two different rigs with it. That makes the BOM and the instructions more unwieldy than they would otherwise be. I wonder whether the rubber band and Silly Putty mechanism should be part of a portrait mode only rig. With a single tilt angle, portrait mode is much smarter for a panning rig if your goal is stitched panoramas. 

A separate kit could be offered for a static landscape rig, and a separate instruction sheet could guide the combining of the two kits to make a panning landscape rig or maybe other things.
