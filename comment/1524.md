Hey, thanks for posting this!  I've been wanting to convert a camera to take IR pictures for a while now.  I tried to open up an old Fuji Z series I don't use anymore, but the IR filter wasn't accessible.  I'm looking forward to hearing your evaluation of different cameras and their possibility for conversion to IR.  

The only thing I'd add:  I did some research across the internet on making a filter that only lets IR pass and blocks visible light.  You mentioned using developed film as the filter, which is what I did as well.  However, about half the sources I found said to develop exposed film, the other half said unexposed.  I choose unexposed, and it was the wrong choice ;).  So, in your guide it might be worth mentioning that the film needs to be exposed, then developed.
