Excellent on all counts; thanks for your update. I agree 3 months is a lot of time, but let me suggest that the search system as a whole needs an overhaul; searching in plots2 is currently quite inefficient, not to mention fragmented between three different controller methods: 

https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/master/app/controllers/search_controller.rb

Search could/should use a search library, too, like... ferret, maybe? I'm not up to speed on the latest Rails search stuff. 

Search can currently happen on the header box, the https://publiclab.org/search page and https://publiclab.org/search/advanced -- and searching for users, or by node type, or by multiple tags, are not possible. 

Also there are a variety of search-related issues open:

* https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/207
* https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/164

So, for now, I think the proposal is fine. But if other students post proposals covering some of the other topics on the Ideas list that you've included here, there's plenty of other important work in the searching/sorting space to dive into. On the other hand, if there are no overlapping proposals, then your current plan sounds super!

Thanks again!
