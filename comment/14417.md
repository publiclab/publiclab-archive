I'm not following the flap bit. Why does the spectrometer need to be blocked? Also, from some simple experiements, I found that I needed much much more light on a subject to acquire reflectance spectra so I have doubts that design extensions for an LED as shown would be commonly useful.

However, since experiments with fluorescence have been of much more interest what about adding a side extension (like a double in parallel) with 45-deg front surface mirror and laser-cut cuvette holder. (I know, that is what I built but it turned out to be quite flexible -- allowing for several modes.
