It's easy to drag a few of your photos from the Mobius into a research note or add them to a post at: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plots-infrared. It would also be helpful to see some of the output images you got from the Fiji Photo Monitoring plugin. That will make it easier for people to help you.  
  
There is a user guide for the plugin at Github: (https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin/blob/master/PhotoMonitoringPluginGuide.odt). Click "View Raw" to download it (Word will open it).   
  
But using the plugin is easy:  
1. drag a photo from the Mobius onto the Fiji window  
2. Select the plugin (single...processing from displayed image)  
3. Use the default values (but maybe use NDVI_VGYRM.lut)  
  
Post your result.
