Hi Kendrick90, You're right that single camera systems have their limitations. The Wratten 25A camera produces a very good NIR channel (blue) with little contamination by visible light, but the red channel has lots of NIR in it. Corrections could be made, but the result will never be as good as a two camera system. Even two camera systems make crude versions of satellite NDVI because the bands are so wide (130+ nm vs. 40 to 100 nm). I'm intrigued by the idea of subtracting some brightness from a channel to account for contamination, but I still haven't figured out how to do it.

Some of the limitations are with NDVI itself. For example, dead leaves still have pigments which absorb selectively and can mimic the signature of healthy leaves. NDVI is a crude index and can't be expected to distinguish all differences in plant health. 

Ned Horning is working on a promising [protocol to calibrate the NDVI](http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/05-01-2014/improved-diy-nir-camera-calibration) from these systems, and I am working on a two camera system with narrower bands.

And here is a narrower band pure-NIR GIF of plasterer bees (*Colletes sp.*) on chickweed (*Stellaria media*). They are collecting pollen from tiny white flowers which are indistinguishable from the green leaves in this NIR band (ca. 850-1050 nm). These are native pollinators so please don't zap them with lasers.
