**Biosensors?**

Going a more bionic route, biosensors _combine_ biological material with electronic components to detect contaminants. I saw them mentioned while browsing this [Hackteria forum](https://forum.hackteria.org/t/lets-share-some-resources-dedicated-to-open-soil-research/332) (thanks [@dusjagr](/profile/dusjagr)!). Here’s a book on biosensors that’s focused on water monitoring but mentions soil occasionally: [Biosensors for Determination of Heavy Metals in Waters](https://www.intechopen.com/books/biosensors-for-environmental-monitoring/biosensors-for-determination-of-heavy-metals-in-waters)
