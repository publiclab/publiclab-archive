Hi Hagit,

Thanks for the great post. 

I am a graphic/media designer first and a mapper second but from my limited knowledge I can point that there have been multiple gestures within the design world to address the particular questions you are posing.  Iconoclasistas have a guide out for Collective Mapping and, in my opinion, what is incredibly useful about their workflow is the use of icons to mark different activities on the map. Some icons are self explanatory others are a bit more ambitious (human trafficking and gentrification), but the map becomes both process and final design-report like artifact. This may allow the communities to be the ones directly "speaking".

I would also check the work being done by the Center of Urban Pedagogy

I agree with Ned that a work-flow for all cases might not be the best route to go since the needs of each particular project are different. Also the constrains and affordances. However, we have to be careful not through our media intervention create representations that are even more alienating in their form than relevant to the community. 

From my personal experience during a community mapping project in Uganda I explored a similar process as what you are suggesting to the post-production activity as a public event. Long story short (for full story see http://publiclab.org/notes/mlamadrid/05-15-2013/tool-for-stalling-mapping) the group I was working with was getting evicted and we were struggling with visibility. I had brought with me a lot of different sensors and speculated on multiple ways of actually embedding story-telling devices on the dirt. First I wanted to build a seed like device that would tell stories of the community once the Ministry of Tourism came to visit the site. Later it was more about the device surviving the actual destruction of the houses. In both instances, when people stepped on it they could hear sounds from the market. 

But while it would have created an interesting and probably compelling way of presenting the information, there were some problems with this idea. First it became apparent that it was not only a matter of visibility but of applying pressure through journalism. The Ministry knew the community was there but the land was worth way more than the community needs. So we created interventions that actually counted on news outlets documenting them (http://www.mlamadrid.com/Tools-for-Stalling-Eviction-Animal-Barricade). Second, the sensor devices had no relevance to the community I was working with and worst, potentially alienated them in the process of creating it. It would have been me, as a media designer, geeking out. 

Community Mapping talks about the idea of returning the tools of control back to people so they can invert the power dynamics. However, there are already instances in the process where the communities forgo their participatory role, like the process of stitching the map once they have collected the pictures. This is why MapKnitter is great. While still not as refine as putting together the map with Photoshop, it does allow pretty much anyone to take over the part of knitting the map.

I guess my argument is, that when thinking of post-production, while it has to definitely utilize strategies that appeal to the taste of the MPs and the state, we have to be careful not through our media intervention create representations that are even more alienating in their form than relevant to the community. 

There is also this interesting project by Beograd Gazela called Travel Guide to a Slum, that provides essential information about the social and economic structures of the area slum through a semi-ironic Travel Guide for tourist and government officials. However I don't remember if Gazela actually took government officials through the slum using this guide. Which would have made for a really interesting intervention.

Sorry for the long comment but hope this helps.
