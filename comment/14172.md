Hi Dave,

yes, of course the DVD grating spreads the light but what I meant was a splitting of the light beam into two parts, where one part could be used for the spectrum and one part for the "sight" or targeting monitor. Just looked it up: its called "beam splitter":

Oh, and here are my two little hobbits. They are called Frodo (the cat) and Sam (the dog):
