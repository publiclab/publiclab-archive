The big mosaic was a combination of three different missions. Two were geotagged using GPS coordinates and the third was just images without any coordinate information. PhotoScan does a good job even without GPS data but the end result will not be geocoded so it won't overlay on a map and it takes longer since the software to do the stitching since it lacks information about how the photos are ordered. 

The main advantage for me using a script is that I don't have to worry about forgetting to set something right and everyone will use the same settings. The script still take some tweaking each day depending on lighting conditions so I'm not sure it the benefit is real.

I think those channels were created by Deere and Caterpillars and to some extent are maintained the same way. Maybe one of the ESF folks can chime in with more details on the channel dynamics. That is part of what they're monitoring.
