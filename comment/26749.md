Hi [@Sonia_2000](/profile/Sonia_2000), I hope you have found a way to progress through this question! This type of assignment-answering is not what our community focuses on. If you find yourself wondering about environmental concerns or using hardware to document pollution, we'd love to help. Good luck!
