Hi everyone,  

Just a quick note to say the first gen loggers survived their initial 3 month deployment giving us real water flow data, (6m depth,~ 50% marine salinity). I had some significant doubts about the rubber bottom model, and the pipe clamp did rust a significant amount. Still, I suspect that design could do 6 months before standard stainless steel pipe clamps gave out. 

The next gen builds are now installed:

P.S. I am still in the field for a few days, and internet time is patchy at best. So I will have to respond to any comments next week. 

cheers!
