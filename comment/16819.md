Super! I'd like to as you to start to think about documenting your plan (adding more detail) not only for yourself and me, **but for other people you could recruit to contribute**. 

Can you continue fleshing out links to relevant code and documentation in your checklist, trying to think about how it looks to a newcomer? 

I've started to work with [@Ashan](/profile/Ashan) to do this [for his checklist](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1438). For example, where there is a reference to `extraButtons`, a feature of the `inline-markdown-editor`, we now link to the corresponding docs in https://github.com/publiclab/inline-markdown-editor/. For a section about a form for comments, we actually link to that code on GitHub so not only he and I can see where the change will have to be made, but it could easily be split out into an issue for someone else -- who doesn't have as much familiarity with the code -- to solve. 

Try to add this level of detail to your plan, and reach out to me and your mentors to find exactly where the code lives if you can't find it yourself! We're happy to help :-)
