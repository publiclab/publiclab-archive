[@jeff](/profile/jeff), the GPS is determined in javascript completely client-side. That image shows altitude as "0.0" - if it the same image that you linked on the wiki. Because of the altitude(from your console) it is not possible to handle the scale, does that image have altitude EXIF? maybe try [verexif](http://verexif.com).

Apart - I'm unable to "preview" from edit comment on publiclab.orgm it just displays blank.
