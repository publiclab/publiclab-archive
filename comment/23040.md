Any Arduino-based data logger should be able to read the signal from that sensor and save the reading at regular intervals. The main obstacle is that Arduinos do not have very good resolution for reading the low voltage signal from that sensor. Also, you must know how to interpret the results--although there is an analog output on the sensor, the manual does not say what the output signals mean or how to convert them to the proper units (e.g., ppb). 

The sensor's analog output provides a signal that varies from 0 to 100 millivolts (mV). You will have to figure out how those voltages relate to the units of interest. The relationship could be linear or not. You could figure that out by noting what the sensor LCD says and what the Arduino says when different concentrations are sampled.

Arduinos typically have analog to digital conversion built in, so any analog pin (e.g., A1, A2, A3, ...) can read the voltage of the sensor output and convert it to a number. However, Arduino analog pins typically provide 10 bits of resolution and measure voltage between 0 and 3.3 volts (Pro Mini) or 0 and 5 volts (Nano). So if there are 1024 (2^10) increments between 0 volts and 3.3 volts, then the entire range of resolution from the sensor (0-100mV) will be expressed as 35 of the 1024 increments, and each increment will represent about 3% of the range of the sensor. There will be at most 30 different levels of gas concentration readings possible. That might be adequate, but it will be rather poor precision..

It is possible to amplify the signal or use a separate, low-voltage, analog to digital converter. I don't have experience with that, but many people do because that's what electrical engineers were created for. [Here is a forum post](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=205229.0) from somebody doing the same thing. You won't like it.

You can also buy a module which will do what you need. I think something like this [Adafruit 16bit ADC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085?gclid=Cj0KCQjw1-fVBRC3ARIsAIifYOM2ar6DQxWOTbQ8o80QnO0mKi9Ykcnw8rtsepoFRa1sSMIBGqS7jJQaAmFNEALw_wcB) might do it, but I'm not sure.
