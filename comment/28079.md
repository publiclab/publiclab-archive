A DVD has a very wide dispersion, so wide that a whole spectrum is hard to obtain. To many lines / mm and the dispersion is doubled by the mirror layer. A CD might do the trick, although even that is quite wide.

However, the reflective layer is not difficult to remove: soak the disk overnight in a dish with a mix of hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide.  the printing ink on the back can be stripped by paint remover.  Don't use the -rw variety as they have a bluish hue. One more unnecessary thing to calibrate...

I mounted a fragment  sawed and filed to size in an old 49 mm filter ring with the glass removed, so I can easily screw it on my Sony NEX kit lens.  The spectrum is recorded against a dull black panel.

To disassemble filters and optical gear cheaply and securely, I use putty knifes ground to size
