I agree with elainechoi89, about using a sealer to create the seam. Since its hard to control the exact amount of heat in relationship to the type and thickness of the plastic an impulse sealer might work better. As you can see here http://www.interplas.com/impulse-sealers in a PDF, impulse heat sealers have adjustable options based on the plastics specifications.
