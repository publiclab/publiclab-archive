Thats probably the 20th Avenue Astoria Generating Station, a complex of power plants owned owned by US Power Gen , Con ED, NRG Energy, and GDF Suez. 

I think the stacks you are looking at are the Coned Station smoke stacks (south of the blue tanks.  May still be running on No 6 Fuel oil that the City is  trying to phase out in favor of natural gas. In terms of the color, some Fuel Oils still have 0.2% sulfur content, so what you may be seeing with the yellow smoke are concentrated SO2 emissions or some other sulfide additive. However some of the Astoria plant may already be gas turbines. DEP Air Pollution Permits list one of the nearby smokestacks (for their emergency generators) as using Diesel Oil so that's another variable.

To play match the smoke color, there is some data here on what fuel types are being used for the different Queens smokestacks here:
