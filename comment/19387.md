I've read through the datasheet/manual for this sensor. Their use of audio connectors for signal and power connections is pretty questionable, but that is neither here nor there.
The '1/4" phone jack" is a 1/4inch audio connector [like this](https://www.amazon.com/GLS-Audio-Speaker-Cables-Snakes/dp/B00CX6021Q/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1523499352&sr=8-4&keywords=1%2F4+inch+audio+connector) , it's the same used in instrument cables or microphone/amplifier audio connections. It's the "Mono" connector, which have a 'tip', the very end of the connector, and the 'sleeve', separated by a little band of plastic. Any old music/instrument cable could be hacked apart to use for this sensor. You'd just need to cut it, and strip the insulation to get to the two conductors, then do some creative soldering to be able to plug it into an Arduino.
