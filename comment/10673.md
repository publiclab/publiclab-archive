Great work, Matthew, and great job leading dusthack in Menomonie.
I'm concerned that  the chair of the geology dept. at UW-Eau Claire is claiming that the dust is mostly limestone, and harmless.

I was able to give a demonstration to one county that there was not limestone in local sandstone, by crumbling the sandstone in a jar, then pulverizing some calcium carbonate in another jar, and pouring a strong acid on both. Sort of like my first science fair volcano w. baking soda and vinegar.
The calcium carbonate foamed spectacularly. The acid sat on the sand I crumbled in front of them as if it was water.
(Note-I identified the test liquid as a strong acid, which it certainly was, but I didn't specifically identify it as toilet bowl cleaner. Toilet bowl cleaner gets no respect, even if it cleans off rust.)

Second, water is a major issue. I add a photo of water coming out of a mine's settling pond. Photo taken Oct. 6 '14.
