Thanks for this question [@tylerknight](/profile/tylerknight). Are you interested in monitoring VOCs indoors or outdoors? And are you hoping to detect particular VOCs or "total VOCs"?

I found a couple papers on sensors that might offer some leads: 
[Review of Portable and Low-Cost Sensors for the Ambient Air Monitoring of Benzene and Other Volatile Organic Compounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5539520/). About halfway down the "Conclusions" section, the authors list some promising devices based on sensitivity. Note that their definition of "low cost" is still pretty pricey (up to 5000 Euros), but they wouldn't need lab analysis. 

For indoor monitoring, there's this more recent article: [Performance assessment of low-cost environmental monitors and single sensors under variable indoor air quality and thermal conditions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132320307836). 

[@sarasage](/profile/sarasage), do you have any tips based on your experience with VOC monitoring?
