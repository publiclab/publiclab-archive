We breathe in 20,000 breaths each day, according to the American Lung Association, 90 percent of which occur indoors. The air inside of our homes is two to five times more polluted than the outdoor air. With asthma and allergies skyrocketing, everyone is affected by poor indoor air quality today. Toxicity tests examine finished products such as pesticides, medications, cosmetics, food additives such as [artificial sweeteners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_sweetener), packing materials, and air freshener, or their chemical ingredients etc. Also for building  Different [scaffoldings ](https://cementconcrete.org/building-construction/formwork-shuttering-for-concrete/2259/)are made to check the air quality from outer side into the room.
