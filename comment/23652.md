 Hi [@liz](/profile/liz)  , [@stevie](/profile/stevie)  ,

I and [@warren](/profile/warren) are working on integrating this library to /people page . I am hoping to get your opinion on : 

1.) What should be the grid color coding we should use ?

2.) What should be the color of marker ?

It would be great if you post your answer here as well : https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/5358#issuecomment-479473790 .

Thank you ðŸ˜ƒ !
