This is very clever. I wonder whether the memory in a Atmega 328p can be used to store data. I wonder if it is possible to access those data later. If those things are possible then a $2.00 Arduino Pro Mini might be all you need. Is the millisecond counter in a 328p good enough to rely on for timekeeping? If so, you can note the actual time you power it up and then compute clock time afterwards from the millisecond stamps.
