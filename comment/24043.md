 Hi [@ishaGupta18](/profile/ishaGupta18)! I wanted to be sure you and [@namangupta](/profile/namangupta) connect about the shared parts of your project. I think it's worth also connecting with [@rexagod](/profile/rexagod) and [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) and looking at how simple libraries may be set up in their own repositories, that later integrate with the main `plots2` codebase. This way, your code would be more self-contained, and a demo could live at the `gh-pages` branch, just like in [some of the libraries i mentioned above](/notes/IshaGupta18/03-04-2019/gsoc-proposal-sensor-data-upload-and-display-library#c22110). You could republish it to demo your work as often as you like. 

Also, both you and Naman should look at http://webjack.io, which is a neat library for collecting data from a sensor. We could even send you both a simple sensor to be plugged in in this way, so that you can have the experience of collecting and uploading data and think about the process holistically. If you'd like, please send your mailing addresses to: kits@publiclab.org and quote this paragraph here in your email! Thanks!
