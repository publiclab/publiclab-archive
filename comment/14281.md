I don't know of any commercially available inexpensive calibration targets. A good calibration target will have the same reflectance for all wavelengths (colors). Most common surfaces reflect a different proportion of blue light compared to red light or NIR. These common surfaces can be used, but it is harder to know the reflectance at any wavelength. For example, not all brown corrugated cardboard will have exactly the same reflectance curve, but they probably all have that steep section between 500nm and 800nm (NIR). The value you choose for the reflectance of red will be very sensitive to the particular curve. For cardboard, it might be acceptable to choose 30% reflectance for red and 45% reflectance for NIR. As long as you always use the same cardboard (and it does not fade or get wet) your results will be comparable with themselves. If you had a surface that reflected 80% of any wavelength that hit it, it is much easier to select a value for any wavelength band (80%).

One target will not be enough. The idea is to describe the relationship between the brightness of NIR or red recorded in each camera pixel (0-255) with the actual energy being reflected from the surface in the NIR and red bands. So you need a curve (an equation) of how pixel values vary with actual reflectance for each wavelength band. So you need at least two points to define each curve. Because your points will have some error (you are not measuring reflectance, just guessing from stuff on the internet) having several points (targets) will probably be good at least to start. You can probably assume a linear relationship because if it is not linear you are going to have a really hard time describing the curve very precisely.

Some of your targets should be bright and some should be dark to cover the range for both red and NIR. If the targets are too dark or too bright, they might be overexposed (255) or underexposed (0) and will not give you very good information. Even black tarpaper reflects 5% of NIR, so the value should not be zero, but it will be zero in a well exposed photo with a small piece of tarpaper in it.

In general, a red filter usually works better than blue.
