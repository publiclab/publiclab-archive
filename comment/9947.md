One of my research notes had  a discussion about 3D Mapmaking in comment thread.  I was asking if anyone had ever heard of using OpenCV for orthorectification in 3D mapping and the closest I could find online was [this short lived discussion on stackexchange](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22180512/algorithm-for-ortho-rectification-mosaic-ing-aerial-images).  Also, [@mathew](/profile/mathew) created this post back in February- https://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/02-25-2014/3d-data-from-image-sets-autostitching
