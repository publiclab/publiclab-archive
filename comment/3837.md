I think the essence here is that you have to watch carefully what is going on and choose a method that seems most appropriate for the situation. That is probably best done by doing the Excel evaluation, and seems like it would be very difficult to do in SpectralWorkbench directly. \r\nI wish there were low cost b/w webcams available because then one would just have to deal with one sensitivity curve instead of overlapping rgb curves. The imaging chip in the webcam that I have partly torn apart has a cover over it. For most purposes that is very good, but I would like to be able to get at the bare chip to see if the color filters are on the top of the stack and exposed to the environment (except for that sort of coverslip that goes over the whole package). If one could access the imager directly then there is some hope of being able to dissolve or bleach the filters. Does anyone know if there is a technique for removing the "coverslip" without wrecking the imaging chip?
