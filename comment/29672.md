Microplastics extremely small pieces of plastic debris in the environment resulting from the disposal and breakdown of consumer products and industrial waste. There are 14 million metric tons of microplastics on the ocean floor . In December of 2020, Microplastics were discovered inside of the placenta which could possibly cause birth and or developmental defects. Microplastic pollution affects the Biosphere, Hydrosphere, Geosphere, and Atmosphere. Studying microplastics and their effects on the environment helps me to understand how to push people to start recycling and find ways to reverse microplastic pollution.
