This note doesn't fully capture the information shared by Randall Auston, Chief of the Spill Response Program, Region 2 (NY City), Division of Environmental Remediation, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, but it's worth looking into because you could call them for information on what to do locally: https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/10-07-2015/nys-dec-oil-samples . Mr Austin is especially good at explaining how to visually estimate the weight of an oil by color, as in looking for the deep purples and bronze colors of heavy heating oil vs the light rainbow sheens of gas. Here is a 3 minute video with footage of oil and gas spill that are labelled as Mr Austin talks over them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-97b2ji6_HY
