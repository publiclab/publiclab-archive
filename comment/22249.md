I agree with Jeff that those results seem to suggest that whatever full spectrum source is used the same general spectral response is found (more brightness in the middle of the spectral range), and that a good explanation is that the detector is more sensitive in the middle of the range. There are other possible explanations for this pattern (e.g., the diffraction grating), and there are other really interesting patterns in the results: 1) the oscillations in the two traces, and 2) the double series in the difference between the two traces.
