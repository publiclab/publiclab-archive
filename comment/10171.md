I'm trying it now! YAY!
We can improve your map naming "help text" as we have a very specific format we recommend, example: 2014-07-27-new-jersey-newark-green-garden-visible

YYYY-MM-DD-GeneralPlaceName-DetailedPlaceName-GroupName-TypeOfImagery

While scrolling up and down in the sidebar, the Create Map button got lost off the bottom of my screen for some reason. I'm sure this is just a tiny detail! But seems like the Create Map button didn't actually create a map...? Nothing changed after i hit the button:
