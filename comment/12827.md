I'm not seeing any bulk sources that get us a price break over the price on amazon, so I don't really see a reason we should carry it over just linking people to the product there. 

having kits carry an item makes sense if we get a huge price break, or if it is an item that is hard to find locally. These stoppers may be something worth bulk purchasing, but the sealant looks tougher.

I also think we could bulk purchase silica desiccant and sell in smaller qty, to throw in with the Riffle.
