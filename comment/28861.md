The reason I ask- the EPA testing will always be expensive.  Sometimes you can do some "screening" pH tests that are much cheaper.  These would be done with pH paper, or inexpensive pH meters, and volunteers.  Once you identify the potential problem areas, go to the EPA testing.  It can save a lot of money.  But.. You may be beyond that point.  Just a suggestion.  Good luck.
