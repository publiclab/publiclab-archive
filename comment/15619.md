Also: I'm not sure if you're testing (1) Hot Tap Water vs Cold Tap Water, or (2) Hot Tap Water vs. Hot Tap Water which has cooled down. Put another way, from the title it looks like you're testing the temperature dependence of conductivity (2), but from your description, it looks like you're interested in whether hot water has more conductive stuff in it (1). Cudos for pointing out that factor, and highlighting what the coqui is measuring through this experiment
