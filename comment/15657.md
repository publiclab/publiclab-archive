Jeff...Actually, looking at the 'Unreinforced' 'Green' peak wavelength shift, the span is 537-549nm (the same peak in the 'reinforced' version is 545.5 +/-0nm). So, with an assumed 546nm CFL calibration wavelength, the data suggests a +3 / -9 nm stability (+/-6nm if a 'uniform' spread). Assuming the sequence in the listing of test conditions was the actual mechanical sequence, then the 'cable tug' was quite significant -- but this is just based on the assumption of the sequence which might not be the case. The 'ideal cal point' is probably not accurately known (and was not one of the objectives) and the data may not represent the full range of 'field conditions'. And yes, if the device is 'weighted down', CFL-calibrated and then not touched for a series of measurements the repeatability would be much better. However, that is never a good assumption for 'general operating conditions' of any measurement device -- it's usually reserved as a 'more strict protocol' for maximum accuracy. If one were wanting to estimate a 'general use' stability spec for the 'non-rigid' design, for confidence of results 'some unspecified time after CFL-Cal', it might have to be set to +/-10nm. Ouch.
