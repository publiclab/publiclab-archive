There was this thread where people were discussing traffic counting: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/publiclaboratory/cw_i-JIH2kA/vn9GW1lzBAAJ

Here's a link to a project available for purchase: http://www.tomorrow-lab.com/work/waycount, that has a link to https://countingcars.com/collections/road-tube-systems

CodeForDC was working on extending TomorrowLab's work here in an open source manner: https://github.com/codefordc/traffic_counter, and i bet someone could get this up and running
