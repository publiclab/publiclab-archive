 I'm glad to see someone thinking about a better layout for the dashboard.  I find it awkward.  I like the features you put on the first mock up that let me keep track of my projects.  I would like to see "projects I'm following" added to that area.  I would not use the "chapter" aspect myself, and wouldn't want to see topics organized by area.  I think the social aspect of this site is great, and there should be a way to share events, but for me it is more idea/project driven.  My biggest frustration with the current layout is the difficulty finding out what others are working on.  New projects get buried in the feed very quickly, so I miss things that may be relevant.  Anyway, thanks for doing this.  Looking forward to the next posting.
