I have learned various things today from Dr. Scott Coffin. He governs companies and prevents them from using microplastics. I've learned about the difference between traditional and non-traditional plastics.  Some Traditional Plastics are Polypropylene, Polystyrene, and High density Polyethylene. Some Non-traditional Plastics are Silicones , Synthetic Rubber, Synthetic Fibers, and Cellulose Acetate. There were no standard methods to study microplastics at first. Most of testing and experimentation are geared to microplastics, but they should advance their studies to focus more on nanoplastics and how they are going to affect the environment in the future. 
Nanoplastics (<40nm) are cytotoxic, induce cell apoptosis, reduce cell proliferation. Polystyrene particles(<500nm) cross placental barrier and distribute to brain, lung, and liver.
