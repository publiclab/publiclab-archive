I took the data from the CSV files that Spectral Workbench provides with my spectra. I had a look at one of dhaffners spectrum CSV files and see the same "Planck quanta" there:

As for the plot: I enlarged it so it would basically fit my screen, and after that I put together screen shots in Photoshop, so the x- and y- directions probably won't have the same enlargement factors. The actual curve data I took from the CSV files I got with my spectra from the Workbench. As I put them into the same diagram their heights should have the same x- and y-scale factors. I included the CSV-data and the original curves in ODS and XML format above if you want to have a look.
