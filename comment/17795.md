There was no setup. I struggled to get a reading with a fluorite from the Rogerley Mine. This specimen is incredibly bright. The issue probably lies in the fact that I had to bounce the light off of the fluorescer rather than through it. If I was measuring contamination content in water I'm sure I could get a reading too. They don't make laser diodes for some of the wavelengths I intend on using so something like a timed capture might work? Here's a reference graph for what my spectra should have looked like. http://www.fluomin.org/galeriespectre/FLUORITE12spectre.jpg
