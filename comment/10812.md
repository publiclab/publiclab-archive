OK, I am making slow, slow progress with GitHub.  I put the Energia code for the LaunchPad in the wrong place but you should be able to access it.  It ended up here: https://github.com/WheeSci/dataLogger_2.  The code that runs the signal generator is really simple and it can be found here: https://github.com/SmokyMountainScientific/SignalGeneratorA.  I think I fixed the problem with the file extensions described in the previous comment and I got the data file in the repo as well.  I am pretty sure that the Energia code requires the altSPI files (the .cpp and .h files) from here: https://github.com/SmokyMountainScientific/altSPI.  These files need to be in a folder called altSPI and that folder needs to be in your libraries folder in your sketchbook. That should be all the software you need.
You can order the printed circuit board from OSHPark.  I just put it on the "shared projects" list.  You can get it from here: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects.  Projects are listed sequentially by the date shared and I put it up on Nov 21 at 21:24 military time.  Before you order a set of boards (they sell them in sets of three) let me know and I will see if I still have one I can send you.  You will also need a solder paste stencil and if I can find it, I will send you mine.  Let me know if you want the Eagle files.  That might be handy if you wanted to switch out the vernier connections for a bnc connector or something like that.
Well, its pushing 5 on a Friday and I think I may have heard the beer siren.
gotta go!
Let me know if you get stuck.
