Thanks for this response and very good advice [@Bronwen](/profile/Bronwen) 

Based on your suggestion, I was able to locate and ascertain the tank purchase and rental availability in my city. As it turns out my university has a contract w/ a local industrial type place that rents 200 lbs tanks (a bit much for my current needs, but good to know). Also, I found a party supply place that sells tanks that holds 4.9 cu ft (cubic feet). According to a  calc-convert site, I found that it is 305.9 lbs. According to a Public Lab site on the balloon mapping setup,  “We are seeing 5-12 inflations if the balloon is minimally filled (40-50 cu ft) 3-5 if it is medium inflated (60-70 cu ft) and 2-3 inflations if the balloon is filled all the way to 80-85 cu ft.”

Cheers,
