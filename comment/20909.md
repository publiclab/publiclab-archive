This is  great project. The trickiest part will be making the device "unnoticeable to the public." That could be a real obstacle to finding a simple solution and could require fabricating clever pseudo fixtures or gaining access to the plumbing. 

If these are single showers (not locker room type multiple showers or shower stalls) and if they are not carefully enclosed (the shower curtain or door allows air circulation even when closed) you might be able to log shower duration with a humidity sensor. An advantage of that approach is that the sensor can be anywhere in the shower stall or even outside the shower. That will make it easier to make the data logger inconspicuous.

The logger could be concealed in a commonplace fixture from the hardware store. For example a [standard junction box](https://www.truevalue.com/single-gang-flanged-old-work-shallow-box?ctplacement=166444-43411605579) and [faceplate](https://www.amazon.com/Enerlites-8801-W-10PCS-Standard-Polycarbonate-Thermoplastic/dp/B01MAYGBVY/) could easliy hold a [Mini Pearl Logger](https://publiclab.org/tag/mini-pearl-logger) with [BME280 sensor](http://www.kaptery.com/product/addon-sensors-etc). This could be glued to the wall anywhere near the shower and might be sufficiently inconspicuous to avoid attention. A Mini Pearl Logger will log data for a few to several months on AAA batteries when controlled by an [external timer](https://publiclab.org/tag/log-a-long-timer).

The BME280 also senses temperature, so you could probably identify a signature of air temperature and humidity that would pin down the start and stop of a hot shower (the humidity will stay pegged at 100% for a while after the shower ends but the temperature will drop quicker).

If you add a [$1.00 sound sensor](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Microphone-Sensor-High-Sensitivity-Sound-Detection-Module-For-Arduino-NEW-FC/152898656886?hash=item2399785a76:g:GtMAAOSwvg9XYC59:rk:8:pf:0) you could more easily identify a shower signature. The cheap sound sensors are sort of flaky, so it might not work on its own.

Logging data (temperature, humidity, and sound level) once every two or three minutes might provide enough resolution without overwhelming you with data.
