[@DanielleS](/profile/DanielleS)  I live and work at the Southern Coast in Brazil in a green forest belt known as Atlantic Rain forest. Traveling to Barnraising/TX would be nice, but for now its far too distant, maybe for next years meeting! Regarding the research on contaminants and its detection, I got some progress and its about the use of chemical reagents. I found one, named "Diphenylthiocarbazone (or Dithizone)" that is  binding to Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg, Pb, Mn, Co, Ni and  it gives color information at the visible spectrum. For more details and updates please check my latest posts.
