Ah, i see - interesting. I think we could explore different ways to sort by time, but "uploaded in this range" seemed the most relevant to me. Time-point is kind of like only the top end of the range, right? So potentially you could use time-range to achieve time-point?&nbsp;
  

Thanks!

> Thank you [@warren](/profile/warren) for the feedback and suggestions.  As you've noticed, design mockups for all the suggestions are missing as they're still in progress. I shall update the proposal with them as soon as I'm done with them.  But I'd like to have the time-point vs time-range concept clarifed. If we select a time-range, what images should we fetch? All images that were uploaded or updated in that time range?  My intention with time-point was, it would fetch all images that existed on the map at that point of time. Along with the correct version of the image that existed at that point of time. If the images were updated at a later time, it would be a way to see all the images as they were in that past point.
