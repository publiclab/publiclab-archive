Ah, i see - interesting. I think we could explore different ways to sort by time, but "uploaded in this range" seemed the most relevant to me. Time-point is kind of like only the top end of the range, right? So potentially you could use time-range to achieve time-point?&nbsp;
  

Thanks!

Along with the correct version of the image that existed at that point of time. If the images were updated at a later time, it would be a way to see all the images as they were in that past point.
