Hmm, Dave, it's odd, but it doesn't seem to me that you're seeing any fluorescence -- do you see any, visibly? Do you normally, with this setup and motor oil? For example, in this set, it seems like you are just seeing the LED itself, but no fluorescence:

Do you know why? I had hoped to see whether the variation in LEDs correlated with any systematic change in the emission/fluorescence light wavelengths.
