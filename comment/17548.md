First, your video is awesome and I'm glad you explained the lines from pulling in the kite. I really like the look of the NASA anemometer--what is the price for that? I also liked the climate change line in there and found your notes about humidity interesting. Makes me wonder how birds are handling things in flight. Would love to engage the conversation on chem trails. [#rabbitholefun](/tag/rabbitholefun)
