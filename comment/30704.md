Phosphorus is biogeochemical cycle a pathway by which a chemical substance moves through biotic and abiotic compartments of earth. It is an important element to us since 85% of the phosphorus in our bodies are found in our bones and teeth. It is essential to plant growth, animal growth, production in animals, and DNA and RNA. It isn’t found in the atmosphere; it’s naturally found in rocks. Rain triggers erosion and causes the phosphorus to run off into the soil. It can be used as a fertilizer and can be absorbed from the soil. Animals can consume it too by eating other plants and animals. Once the animal excretes their waste, the waste goes back to the soil and overtime, it becomes sedimentary and returns to an abiotic state.
