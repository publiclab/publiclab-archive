When I couldn't find any free, high-resolution aerial imagery of my coral reef study site, [@glennon](/profile/glennon) introduced me to BAP and KAP. Since then I've used it to for mapping but also as a way to teach students in California and Indonesia about remote sensing for environmental monitoring.

Map-reading isn't a universal skill. I've found that the process of shooting and then arranging aerial photos into a mosaic helps people connect their ground-based perspective with the aerial perspective of a typical map.
