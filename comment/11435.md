What about color and white balance?

Your example image shows an awfully strong red/yellow back light which will change hue of the colorimeter.

It might help to build this photo card around a colorchecker card or on top of a colorchecker card, with instructions to focus the camera at a particular point.

This might all be moot if the color changes along the graduated marks. In that case, even a grayscale image would suffice to demonstrate where the gradient changes color, although then you'd want to make sure you have contrast set appropriately. Contrast can shift gradients. Might want to build the photo card on a gray card to help with that.
