Thanks Nick, I just tested fluxguard and it works great. The test was on my own site (they are not spraying for mosquitoes now) but there is no indication that it won't work on any site. I got an email a few minutes after I edited the site. This is exactly what I need and the site seems very smart. I can't wait to alert my neighbors via Twitter!
