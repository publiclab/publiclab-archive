So awesome, thanks Cort! I [modified your code](https://codebender.cc/sketch:238365) for the Trinket and put it on Codebender.com, using pin [#4](/n/4) (analog pin 2) for the potentiometer and pin [#0](/n/0) for the LED. 

Been trying to connect to the Trinket but [Codebender](http://codebender.com) isn't connecting on my Chromebook, and 10.9+ OSX needs [some serial drivers](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) apparently. Rebooting... we'll see!
