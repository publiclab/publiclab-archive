A blue filter should be an acceptable alternative to a red filter when measuring vegetation if the spectral response of the blue filter is sensitive to chlorophyll absorption (~460nm). You may be able to determine the spectral sensitivity of a camera/filter pair if you have access to a monochromator or maybe just look at the filter's spectral response function. 

Blue would be a better choice than red if you are calculating the NDVI of any vegetation that has yellow flowers. On the other hand, a major drawback to using blue light is that the atmosphere scatters it much more than red light (Rayleigh scattering) and so surface reflectance measurements in blue wavebands will be higher than they should unless you perform an atmospheric adjustment (i.e. dark object subtraction) or an atmospheric correction. This is an issue even for balloon mapping since the atmosphere gets thicker as you approach ground level.

It may be useful to consider using one white and one black reflectance target to calibrate an image to reflectance rather than directly calibrating to some reference NDVI value. Maybe use a teflon chip and a brushed panel coated with extra flat black paint. The white and black reference targets will span the entire range of reflectance values for surface features within an image, thereby improving the accuracy of subsequent NDVI calculations.
