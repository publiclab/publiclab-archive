hi guys,

it's my first post here, sorry for my english but I'm a french native speaker    :o)
Just to be sure : if well understood, the goal of this group is to make some cameras wich show an interpretable picture about NDVI to use it for plants growing...
But excepted in this post here above, all pictures that I see are very pretty with wonderfull colors but unusable to know where we must treat a field with efficience.
Am I totally wrong or maybe have I missed something ?
The pictures on this page (very interesting because you see directly the leaves they always contain chlorophyl) come from a double camera with red filtering , are they some equivalent results on single cameras ( red or blue filters )?

thanks
