[@pdhixenbaugh](/profile/pdhixenbaugh) -- These are great ideas / questions / suggestions!

I just posted a quick follow-up here:

https://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/03-23-2016/sync-mod-for-ambient-background-removal-first-tests

Looking forward to digging into your questions in more depth soon ... I think (maybe!) some of them might be resolved with some upcoming experiments ...
