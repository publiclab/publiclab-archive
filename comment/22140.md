Hey [@warren](/profile/warren) [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet)! I'm really glad that you liked the proposal! üòÉ 

Sorry for the delay, the past couple of days have been very tedious due to college stuff! But that's all done with and I've compiled together a list of the functions/data structures used in this project below. [@warren](/profile/warren), should I add a proper documentation regarding the same in the proposal above, since I thought that I'll be doing that in the code itself in the first couple of weeks? But, I'd be happy to anyway! üëç 

|Fn./Structure name|Description|
|:-------|:----------|
|matrix_t|Basic structure to store data in terms of rows/columns, or image width/height along with the respective signatures (usually `jsfeat.U8_t | jsfeat.C1_t` -- single channel unsigned char)|
|match_t|Records learned variables (screen index, pattern index, pattern level, distance) in a structure|
|demo_opt|Controls user-defined options along with critical training|
|train_pattern|Maintains original aspect ratio, apply grayscale and resample, prepare preview canvas with half (if not overridden) the original dimensions, preallocate corners and descriptors, detect keypoints in a loop as defined by `num_train_levels`, and finally store their coordinates after adjusting respective to the preview canvas size (determined earlier)|
|demo_app|Perform final steps such as line colors, stroke styles, number of descriptors to define, and displaying info through `stat` object|
|tick| Major rendering fn. (applies filters, renders patterns and matches back to the canvas, and supply info to the `#log` element)|

Rest are util fns. that majorly make use of the `JSFeat` APIs to perform primitive objectives as is indicated by their definitions. These are,

- detect_keypoints: Uses `yape06.detect` method to perform detections
- find_transform: Calculate line geometry between keypoints in both canvases and re-estimate the same if motion change is detected in the canvas
- match_pattern: Performs naive brute-force matching. Each on screen point is compared to all pattern points to find the closest match.
- render_matches: Draws a `match_mask`(connecting lines) depending on the params passed down to it.
- render_pattern_shape: Draws a box around the most probable area, with the highest number of keypoints.

```js
	    ctx.lineTo(shape_pts[1].x, shape_pts[1].y);
            ctx.lineTo(shape_pts[2].x, shape_pts[2].y);
            ctx.lineTo(shape_pts[3].x, shape_pts[3].y);
            ctx.lineTo(shape_pts[0].x, shape_pts[0].y);
```

Also, I do believe that it'll surely be a good practice to abstract off as much methods as we can which will definitely help us in the future with custom functionalities and testing requirements! Thanks!
