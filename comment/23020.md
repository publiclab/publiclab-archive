DFRobot makes a Turbidity Sensor For Arduino (SKU:SEN0189). It's sitting in my forge right now and integrating it with a Mini-Pearl logger ( [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) )  is on my growing list of things to do.  My goal is monitoring mountain streams associated with mining runoff and identifying time and duration of events.  This really precludes either Secchi disks or turbidity tubes.
