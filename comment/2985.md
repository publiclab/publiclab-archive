Hi Jan,
Thanks for this post.  It is really good to see data on the effect of the blue LED.  Your spectrograph makes it clear that most people will want to take action to eliminate the blue bump.  There is nothing like data to help you make a decision.

Your comparison of spectra of CFL bulbs is also quite revealing. It is sometimes hard to pick the exact peak during the calibration, often because the spectrum is overexposed and the peaks are flattened. So the first thing to do to reduce this error is to avoid overexposure. Any error in the calibration can be exaggerated in the right part of the graph. So the big europium peak at 688 nm does register well among the spectra in your graph. Some of this error could be avoided by manually calibrating spectra using the new feature at Spectral Workbench on the analyze page. Under "More tools", "Macros/scripting" you can enter code to align any spectrum with any wavelengths.  There is more information here: http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/spectral-workbench-api, but we need some better instructions and one more feature added so users can easily figure out how many pixels from the left edge each peak is. This manual process is harder for now but allows a calibration to be made on more widely spaced peaks, or peaks that are not flattened.
