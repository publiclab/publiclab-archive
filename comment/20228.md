Don't forget that when doing absorption spectroscopy:

1. The two spectra (photos of the reference and the sample) must be taken with the same camera settings (exposure, gain, white balance).
2. The formula is Absorption = log10(reference/sample), but Absorption=reference-sample is easier for students to understand.
