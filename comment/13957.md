This is a good example of how the spectrum of incident light influences the NDVI of a scene. Leaves reflect about 10 times more NIR than red, but if there is 100 times more red than NIR in the incident light, a camera will see more red than NIR reflected from leaves. Normal NDVI calculations will be very hard to interpret.

The blue channel records NIR which should be much brighter (farther to the right in the histogram) than the red channel for leaves (small marquee in image). Instead, the red channel is much brighter than the blue channel.
