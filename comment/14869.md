Good stuff, Tony! Can you post information about sizes so people would know which box would have the lucky, snug fit? That's exciting! What else is in the box attached to the cone head of the old light? Could a micro-computer fit in there and control turning the camera on and off? Can the Mobius be controlled by a micro-computer?
