Sure I'll post a question about it! After stewing on it a while, I don't think it should be a huge issue in most relevant contexts, (esp. for other people looking at absorptance), but maybe the only real big thing to pay attention to is that the grating is spreading the spectrum horizontally so that it aligns with the cross section.
