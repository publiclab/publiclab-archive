Interesting - My guess is that the preset white balance is responsible for the nice looking images. It would be interesting to record some RAW images and compare with the white balanced ones to see how each channel is being modified. It's possible that the "cloudy" white balance setting reduces blue since on a cloudy day there is probably an excess of blue scattering going on but that's just a guess. It would also be interesting to see how these compare with standard RGB images to see if they actually provide better information about vegetation vigor/health.
