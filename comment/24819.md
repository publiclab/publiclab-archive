As a follow up, I do not do IR photography so I have not looked elsewhere on Public Lab, but good results could likely be achieved with a DSLR that has had its IR high-pass filter removed. This is not a job for someone without the requisite tools, mechanical and electronic background, and ability to document a disassembly to provide a satisfactory reassembly. Some fairly impressive older DSLRs can found used in the $250-$300 USD range, making this conversion feasible. Modifying a Pentax K-5 is discussed here:
