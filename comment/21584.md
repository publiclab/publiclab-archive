I made this! The print took about 36 hours and Amazon sells $12 diffraction slides. The .stl files aren't scaled properly when imported to Cura, but using a 25.103 multiplier seemed to work accurately enough. What emitter do you recommend for the fiber optic excitation adapter? The flashlight adapter works well but I would like to buy the fiber optic excitation method for a wider range of excitation. The design printed well and I recommend using raft and support "everywhere" for thermal extrusion printers. Thanks for this awesome design and lemme know what excitation you recommend!
