Ok, additional measurements might help to identify why: 1) the peak center is different, 2) the slopes of the curve "sides" are much steeper (while the entire spectral BW of the curves is well within the webcam's BW, 3) there is a secondary notch and peak in yours which is not there in the reference and 4) the longer wavelength "tail" is essentially 'missing'. However, I suspect none of of these differences are related to minor factors like grating material, chemical  concentration variance or even one webcam vs another. I'd suggest looking at more fundamental differences like the illuminant's wavelength and spectral bandwidth --- and I'm also guessing you have not employed any form of amplitude vs wavelength correction ......... reading up on the reference data's test methods might give some additional clues. It is generally best to assume that official reference data is exact and  all user collected data is in error to some degree and so always requires a search for the contributing errors and then correction techniques before any form of validation can be attempted.
