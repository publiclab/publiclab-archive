Hey Jeff! Probably! This is one of the drinking water deposits of my home city. At the end of summer I'll come back as in the last years it gets almost fully dry leaving a muddy ground exposed. In some years water cuts will be common in a traditionally wet land that is Galicia. 

By the way, this was my first Delta kite flight with a recently HQ Rainbow of 3 meters and difference with my previous Power Sled 240cm y noticeable. Stability is in another level. So happy with it. 

Thanks for your comments and the processing ;D
