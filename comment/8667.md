I think auto-focus varies from phone to phone... I haven't had an issue myself with that but it'd be good to know which phones suffer from rapid auto-focus problems. 

Re: Chrome Beta, come now, Dave - cut me some slack! They took almost a year to actually add the feature and now it's only been confirmed 6 weeks ago on an obscure issue tracker -- and did it differently from all the other browsers. I've created an issue (https://github.com/jywarren/spectral-workbench/issues/248) and we should be able to address this now, but "broken" is a little harsh, don't you think? We're doing our best! :-)
