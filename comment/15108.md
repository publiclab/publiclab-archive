One precaution to prevent crushing the pole is to attach only to the double-thick area at the top of the tube. Right where the pole sections stack, they've added as second layer of carbon fiber wrapping and an extra coat of polyester resin:

That said, [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) is right it--it would be great to plug the end to prevent the pole from being crushed.  It would have to be tapered to match the taper of the pole and inserted from the bottom. It should probably be locked in place with a screw & washer on top. carbon fiber is great in tension, so pulling the plug very snug to the top of the pole would provide the best re-enforcement, essentially pre-stressing the pole outward in tension before compressing it with the cable clamp.  Screwing a screw in to pull the plug upwards is an easy way to do this.

But what shape should the plug be? Each pole section is a regular cone, so by measuring the outside diameter of the cone at multiple points, we can determine its angle.  Starting from a measurement of the inside diameter of the top of the pole and using the cone's angle to extrapolate downwards, a conical plug could be designed. 

 It would probably be a quick 3D print, although allowing for the shrinkage of the plastic will be a bit tough.  I imagine for people wanting to lift micro 4/3rds and other larger cameras this would be a real helpful addition.
