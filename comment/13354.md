That looks promising. I guess that PiCamera module is a useful tool. I think that photo is a little too yellow. The blue values for foliage are very low (mostly < 30) and the red values are very high (often > 200). Many leaf pixels have a NIR:VIS ratio greater than 8:1 and NDVI computes to 0.8 or higher. If healthy foliage has a NIR:VIS ratio near 3:1 then NDVI will compute to 0.5 which is more reasonable. So different values for awb_gains might be called for. Exposure is also important, so try to take photos with foliage that is not over exposed.
