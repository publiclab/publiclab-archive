[@warren](/profile/warren) Yes the author page https://publiclab.org/notes/author/cess/https://publiclab.org/notes/author/cess/ was where I imagined the drafts tab. And if a drafts button is to be placed on the dashboard I think it would be best to place it in the dropdown menu for the profile picture. Placing the drafts button on the dashboard page itself would look out of place because a button leading to the drafts should be found where you can find a user's notes. That way everything has its own place.

You are totally right about the comments section.
