[@alejobonifacio](/profile/alejobonifacio), thanks for sharing the video, it was great to see such engaged students and how they use the DIY microscopes and app together ðŸ˜€

Regarding testing water and soil for heavy metals:

+ The [Nuestros Suelos](https://publiclab.org/notes/sureta/01-09-2020/nuestros-suelos-a-low-cost-toolkit-for-the-participative-assessment-of-soil-degradation) project by [@sureta](/profile/sureta) in Chile and collaborators in the US is developing low cost methods for detecting copper and arsenic in soils. [@sureta](/profile/sureta), could your methods potentially be applied to water? 

+ And [this comment](https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/02-05-2021/what-are-other-ways-to-assess-soil-contamination-besides-directly-measuring-contaminant-concentrations#c28150) by [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) mentions that there's potential for water heavy metal tests to be applied to soil.
