Hmm, i looked on DigiKey and found some more options, some high brightness, and one listed as 365nm, which'd be great:

One, the [VLMU3500-385-060TR-ND](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/VLMU3500-385-060/VLMU3500-385-060TR-ND/5449063), pictured here, looks very similar to what I'm using, but **385nm**, 100x minimum order, $4.40 each:

It'd have to be soldered to aluminum, i'd guess. If it's as narrow as the ones we're using, that might get us clear data down to 425nm, instead of only above ~440-450nm.

The [160-2184CT-ND](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/LTPL-C034UVH365/160-2184CT-ND/5414544), at $4.70-$8, is at 365nm, and 500MA/665MW, which is just a little less power than the one I'm using. It runs on 4v, but says "none available". But i'd love to test it!
