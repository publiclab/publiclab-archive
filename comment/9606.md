[@mathew](/profile/mathew) - just dug up this old note, which shows a method for equalizing area. I'd love to find more literature on the subject, but it's worth a try!

We could/should also try to record a series of fluorescence spectra for a single sample at different intensities, to see if we can equalize them to be roughly the same with this technique.
