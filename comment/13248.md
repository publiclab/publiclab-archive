Love this. Thanks Scott! 

One thing I'm thinking is that if there's one more expensive lab test done to determine that one sample is crude and not consumer oil, and we take a scan of that with the oil testing kit, we could leverage that original test by testing lots more samples with the OTK. Is there a specific case you can think of where a sample has been tested traditionally and we could try that methodology?

Also, wanted to check that you're in touch with [@annchen](/profile/annchen) about use cases and narratives as she's working on that! Thanks again!
