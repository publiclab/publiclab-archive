Thanks Chris,

We have multiple injection well sites in our county, and more in the works, so we are planning on covering a large area.  We will be installing sensors at drinking water wellheads and in some springs and creeks.  I've used the Cave Pearl Logger in a tensiometer project I'm developing, and like how it has held up in the field.  For this project I'd like to have the option for data storage on an sd card as well as developing an up-link option where feasible.  Total package will probably exceed my $20 budget, but I'd really like to keep the logger-sensor component under that if possible.

I'm still pulling together some ideas and making a plan for the sensor part. I'll post it as a project when I have it a little better defined.
