Oh, almost forgot my other question! Do the camera lens and aperture make any difference at all? You didn't use a camera for this... could you try it out with a webcam?

So for the instructions in the DSK, your point is that actually the camera should not be aligned perpendicularly to the grating, because doing so makes the ideal grating/slit distance huge?

Let me rephrase -- shall we try a modification of our existing DSK design by tweaking:

* the angle between the camera and the grating
* the angle between the grating and the slit

in order to achieve the best focus for a basically fixed distance between the grating and the slit, which is ~8-10cm?
