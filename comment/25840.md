In your second image look at the ccd sensor identified as V2 ithas a reddish tint to it look for something like that on the back end of the lens assembly,scribe around that using a sharp tool, basically scratching the filter in a circular motion using the  inside barrel as a guide think of the filter as being a part of a stack of elements with the filter as the last one in the stack which is being scribed with the tool. Have a close look in the photos in my note. This is the best I can describe in words at this stage of disassembly you are 90% home. have another look at my note it should be pretty clear.. dont forget to blow the dust residue off with air.
