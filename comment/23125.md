I would thing the first thing to check is whether or not the camera is working. Try removing the grating support or even pull the base out of the box and point the camera at a reasonably well lit scene. Open a web cam app on your PC and see if you get an image from the camera. If you have two cameras plugged in - the spectrometer and a web cam. Unplug the spectrometer and check you get an image from your web cam. Then unplug the web cam and plug the spectrometer camera in and see if you can see an image with that. Although this is a bit tricky on a laptop with a built in web cam.
It may be a device selection problem - Spectral Workbench not selecting the camera or the right camera. On my system SB running via Firefox wont see the camera if I have a web cam plugged in as well.
I also find camera sensitivity can be a problem. I use a camera app - GUCView - to adjust camera gain, WB etc before running SB. The camera settings I choose will persist if I close the camera app and immediately open SB.
