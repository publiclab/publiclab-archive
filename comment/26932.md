Cool stuff here!

Thanks for your response! [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1) 

I think an 8th question will be helpful too, if anybody thinks they can provide some feedback on it.

8)  How do you usually use the toolbar?  The toolbar comes in handy when you need to format your contents. Like adding a header or making some texts bold. 

For persons creating content that is long using posts or questions, reaching for the toolbar at the bottom to format text at the top of their content can be a bit annoying, so https://publiclab.org/post we have introduced a floating toolbar,  wondering if you can tell us your thought on this,  and if anything can change about it? 

Thank you!!!
