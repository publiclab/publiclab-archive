Thanks [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) for reminding me of the Raleigh scattering, my equally scattered Sunday evening brain didn't quite put two and two together. The reason for using the 400-700nm filter is to be sure of the range I'm looking at (I know the specs of the filters I use, I don't of the ones that are in the pi cameras). The reason to use this approach instead of just using a single red bandpass is that using the 400-700nm filter will yield me a standard RGB image which is usable in other ways. Mainly I can still use the other channels to calculate a Gcc index (G/R+G+B), using a red bandpass would remove this option. I'm trying to get the most out of the setup (in terms of data streams as well as channels).

I changed the images to your scale. Looks nicer this way. It makes the difference in dynamic range all the more apparent.
