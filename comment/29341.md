Two big ways to save energy (and money on your utility bill) I see over and over again have to do with your lighting and your laundry habits. Traditional bulbs lose the majority of their energy as wasted heat, so swapping to LEDs will save energy and money in the long run as they last much longer. There's a lot of ways to make your laundry habits more energy-efficient. First is using cool or cold water rather than warm/hot. As long as you don't need to disinfect the load (like washing cloth masks for COVID protection), most detergents can handle cold water these days. It also helps to only run full loads and to air dry when you can. My approach to saving energy at home is: every penny counts! Lots of little things will add up and make a big difference in the long run. Start with the basics (turn off lights, save water) and, when it makes sense, opt for bigger investments like energy efficient appliances and weatherization.
