I don't think there is too much overlap in proposals, and I'm going to encourage both of you to widen your scope to make your proposals unique but helpful counterparts. 

(repeating what I wrote to Pascal) There's plenty of work to be done in SWB! My initial thought is that Pascal's interest is in exposure, clipping, and sample row selection, whereas you are interested in calibration. Perhaps if each of you affords the other space and coordinates where your code "touches", this can work... if you each take on another sub-project as well, we can get an awful lot done this summer! 

One area is Macros. I think the macro system could make it much easier for people to add new functions to SWB, and some better "plumbing" of that system, as well as the ability to access/run macros both at capture time and analysis time, would make a huge difference. Other interesting things macros could offer:

* more powerful "matching" features
* more informative tools for displaying results -- easy ways to highlight a region of the spectrum display, to add a % indicator at a given wavelength, to indicate quality of match to a given reference. 
* related to the above -- a way to easily create a macro for a given purpose, like "matching a type of oil from a set of references"
* a macro which helps "troubleshooting initial spectrometer setup" (which might make recommendations about exposure, calibration, intensity, light leaks).

Another feature which could be interesting is one which automates collection of spectra periodically (every 5 minutes, every minute) and helps you search for events over time, like heavy metal spectra in a smokestack flare, or something. This means of collecting data 24hrs a day could easily overwhelm the current system, but some smart adaptation of SWB could make this a powerful analytic technique. Maybe it would only save a spectrum if a certain condition is met. Maybe it would save everything locally but only prompt you to upload unique events -- rapid changes in the spectrum or something. Lots of possibilities related to http://publiclab.org/wiki/refinery-watching

After all, Sreyanth, you did propose quite a few projects for this summer -- even if you let Pascal work on sample-row-selection (digitization) you'd still have calibration, offline SWB, and potentially macros or 24-hour monitoring to work on. And, you two could help each other problem-solve.
