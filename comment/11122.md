Thank you very much. I'm sorry if my initial response seemed overly protective of my results. I hope I don't wind up like Fleischmann and Pons !
I have now repeated the experiment and this time I was super careful about adjusting my captures to be just on the point of clipping, which gave me a clearer view of the green double peak and allowed me to more precisely choose the longer wavelength of the two. This has refined my results. Although this second test still supports my hypothesis about the effect of the dye it shows an even greater increase in the red wavelengths relative to the shorter wavelengths when the 'no dye' grating its used. With the dye and switched to the component colour view I could see the blue and green tending to clip, then with the 'no dye' I could see green and red tending to clip.
