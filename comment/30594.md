Catfish drop their eggs in tilapia territory when they go hunt. The tilapias assume those are their own eggs and pick them up in their mouths. Catfish eggs hatch earlier than cichlid eggs, and these juvenile catfish feed on the cichlid eggs, which is bad for the tilapia. But, when the catfish eggs hatch, they think the tilapia is their mother and she thinks that those are her children. Parasitic relationship because tilapia loose their eggs.
