I couldn't get statistically significant differences in the measured amplitude levels using the resistor ranges I chose, which were based on measuring the microphone.

Unfortunately it looks like either the bluetooth hands-free unit is doing DC offset correction or the resistances I was testing with weren't significant enough. If I had an oscilloscope and potentiometer I could more definitively rule this out as a communications possibility (or figure out what went wrong).
