That's a good description of what the Rosco blue filter does. Both the blue and the red channels will have a mixture of visible and NIR light. The blue channel will capture mostly blue, and the red channel will capture mostly NIR. So it does not produce the most pure NIR photo but it can work. A red filter generally produces a more pure NIR photo in the blue channel. Wratten 87 produces pure NIR photos in all three channels.
