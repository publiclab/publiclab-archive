Hi Ben,
There is a lot to dive into here. I would really like to learn how this circuit works. I'm also new to this, and have a lot of questions. This goes past my undergrad level of electronics.

I've heard about instrumental drift, but I'm not quite sure what it looks like. The measured voltages change over time, due to how temperature changes affect the electronics. Would it help to calibrate as close as possible to the expected mean temperature of the long term deployment, or are the R5 and R6 enough to minimize drift?

How do R5 and R6 compensate for drift? There are switches that allow the current to flow through R5, R6, or Rprobe. How are they used to correct for drift? (And why are there two switches on either side of the probe - is that to completely isolate it from current?)

How does a digital switch work? Can you switch it "on" or "off" by sending a certain signal to it? Or does it work another way?

I made an overlay of the circuit diagram with the different parts of the voltage divider (V+, GND, R1, R2, Vread) outlined:

I have an introductory level familiarity with op-amps, but I'd like to learn what they're used for in your circuit. The voltage follower at IC1A ensures that the voltage at the output (1) equals the voltage at the non-inverting input (3). Why is that done? Is it to protect the voltage source, or boost the amount of current going through the circuit?

Similarly, what's going on at IC1C, R7, R13, and R14,  and how does that differ from the "Ground" on the ideal voltage divider circuit?

And for the "Vread" section of the circuit, with 6 op amps, I am definitely out of my depth here. I see that there are two parallel lines connecting before and after the adjustable resistance, there are voltage followers, diodes, capacitors going to ground. I'm not sure what happens at IC2D, and R9 through R12 where the lines join. What is happening in this section, and why?

Then, it looks like the IC2C is a non-inverting amplifier, right before the Vread pin? What considerations go into making that and choosing the resistors.

Thanks for considering these questions. I hope I can dive right into circuit building, and start testing circuits like these.
