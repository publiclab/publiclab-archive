Hi Giovanni -

You should be able to use the photo monitoring plugin to process images from different cameras even if the cameras have different sensor size and resolution. You will need to make sure the variable for the transformation type is set to "affine". I haven't tested that thoroughly but as long as the camera pose and location of the two cameras are not very different it should work reasonably well -  but probably not as well as using cameras with the same image dimensions and resolution. If you proceed with your work I'd be interested to hear how well it works.

All the best,

Ned
