Hi this looks awesome! I also have a pole and kites you're more than welcome to borrow if you'd like. You should share this out to the Gulf Coast google group as well:: plots-gulfcoast@googlegroups.com What time are you planning on doing the mapping? 

Looks like fun, excited to hear how it goes.
