Hi [@anirudhprabhakaran3](/profile/anirudhprabhakaran3) thank you for this proposal! It looks like you have a good handle on the specific types of migrations that'll be necessary. My experience is that it's easy to forget something and hard to test migrations, so we can end up in a "broken" database state if a migration fails. How might we meet that challenge? Ideas:

- create mock legacy data (this seems... overboard? but also, how do we know it is as "weird" and irregular as real legacy data is? what if we miss something?)
- test migrations out on the unstable server (https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/main/doc/TESTING.md#testing-your-work-with-unstable). We might need to ask Sebastian (username _icarito_) to back up some of the tables in unstable so that we can try over and over 😅 

Finally, if you're able to complete this project ahead of time, which... maybe I'm optimistic, but I think it could be the case! What other projects might be interesting to you in your remaining time? 

Thank you!
