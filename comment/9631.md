Thanks for the links.

Supposedly grass also changes color as the soil loses moisture (IIRC, it becomes less green and more blueish?), and people can train their eyes to look for it.  So, allegedly a signal is there even in the visible spectrum.  Are there instruments which can measure/track that color shift, and if so, what are they?  Could the public labs low-cost spectrometer (or some other instrument) be leveraged to that end by sampling the grass spectra and somehow calibrating it against the ambient solar spectra at the same moment, or is it just too hard a problem to do without calibration cards?

Accurately measuring color and spectra seems like a technically deep topic, and I sincerely want to avoid having my attention derailed into a physics project that's over my head.  Rather, I'm hoping there are *simple*, inexpensive off-the-shelf measurement tools that "just work" that I can leverage and use without having to invent (or re-invent) anything new.
