The spectral plot of grass that you are interested in replicating is a plot of reflectance. This curve represents a very well known pattern of reflectance of green grass. Here are some other examples.  The Y axis is reflectance.

Spectrometers based on consumer cameras, like the Public Lab spectrometer, do not produce results in units of reflectance. The Y axis is instead something like relative brightness. I don't know of any attempt to determine the exact relationship between this relative brightness and reflectance.  For the reasons listed in a comment [here](http://publiclab.org/notes/WhiteRabbit/07-27-2014/question-can-i-use-the-desktop-spectrometer-to-analyze-ordinary-reflected-light), you should not expect a very tidy relationship between the Y axis of a spectral plot from a Public Lab spectrometer and the Y axis of a professional spectrometer plot. 

That relationship is expected to be quite messy if you are interested in comparing reflectance of visible light to reflectance of near infrared light as the plots of grass above do. Consumer cameras are not intended to capture near infrared light.  After the IR block filter has been removed, they capture NIR, but apparently not with the same sensitivity that they capture visible light. So a spectrometer based on a consumer camera might never capture that steep "red edge" between visible and NIR reflectance of vegetation. 

Although the absolute values of brightness reported by a spectral plot from a Public Lab spectrometer should be interpreted with caution, the tool has some powerful uses. For example, when you compare the color of light passing through a solution (solvent plus solute) to the color passing through just the solvent, you can know with some precision how much of each color was absorbed by the solute (subtract one spectrum from the other). This subtraction conveniently bypasses many of the artifacts caused by the consumer camera, and could even provide good results across the visible/NIR boundary.  

When [properly built and calibrated](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/3-6-2013/polynomial), a Public Lab spectrometer can also identify the wavelength of peaks or dips in a spectrum with very good precision and accuracy. This type of accuracy is not compromised by the artifacts related to the consumer camera.
