Sorry, I didn't finish the instrument explanation.  After determining the size of a particle,most instruments find out how many particles are greater than 5 micron  and how many are greater than 0.5 micron in a set period of time.  This is then displayed or printed.  Heck, some will even give you a bell shaped curve, if you want it.

Other instruments will use the laser diffraction pattern.  The last I saw, they needed you to select a " model" for the calculation. That may have changed. These instruments weren't as popular.
