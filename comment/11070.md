I'm sad I can't make it! 

I want to let you know if you don't already that Crab Park is very likely controlled airspace. There is an active helipad right beside it and it's really close to the float plane terminal. Definitely call Nav Can and make a notam/get permission. I can dig up the number for you if they aren't forthcoming. I recommend Spanish Banks if you want to find a beach where you have lower air safety threats and don't need to make a notam. Vanier Park is better but I still wouldn't recommend it unless you make a notam. Anywhere near downtown is basically swarming with float planes!
