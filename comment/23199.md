The cost for analysis can be quite costly. We are currently working in our lab network (Enthalpy Analytical LLC) to be able to offer a low cost screening test for concerned residential customers. This test will be ready to launch this week. The cost will be $149 for analysis, will provide PFOA, PFOS, and PFBS values. This quick screen will help to determine if further action must be taken. 

Please feel free to reach me directly at 989.772.5088 ext 14608.
