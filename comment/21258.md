So, after reviewing my drawings I discovered I'd made a huge mistake on the cell constant (K) in the two post probe design.  The cell I designed would have a K value of 100 not 1.  So I'm redesigning using electrical spade connectors.  The equation for calculating K is K= L/A where L is the distance between the posts and A is the area of the post in cm.  A spade connector will give me an area of A=0.51sq.cm. so if I put the posts 1/2 cm apart L will be .5 cm.  That gives me a K of .98 which is right where it needs to be.
