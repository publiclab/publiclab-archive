Hi Jeff. 

I found that the "wobbling" problem is in fact a nasty interferrence pattern which arise in the protective glass which covers the ccd/cmos chip. That's it, it seems that proffesional spectrometer suppliers are changing that glass with  AR coated glass on both surfaces. So the small interference pattern you noticed in your webcam it's ok. So now I am stucked with this problem and struggling to subtract this signal by some sort of algorithm.
