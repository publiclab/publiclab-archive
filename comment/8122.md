These are Brenden's photos, so I'm not sure, but I think he was experimenting with different camera settings, which are mostly irrelevant if you work from the RAW image data.  So they are probably jpg, as are all of the infrablue photos I have taken. If the camera records RAW, the custom white balance setting is not applied to the image, so you have to do that after the fact. I have not figured out how to reconstruct what a custom white balance setting does by post processing RAW data. But there must be a way.
