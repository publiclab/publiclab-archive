Hey  [@ezrajet9](/profile/ezrajet9) Thank you for drafting this proposal ‚ù§Ô∏è ! I like the idea of adding recently used coordinates as [@jywarren](/profile/jywarren) had mentioned here https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor/issues/754 on the post page with a similar design as in the image shown in this link ‚úåÔ∏è

As for the stacking tooltips is considered I like the second solution of keeping only one open at a time üëç 

For the saving/drafting part I am not sure if [#clear](/tag/clear) would be the best way to visually add that since it is taking up some space I wonder if we can think of an icon or something else to convey the same ü§î 

Also wondering if you can focus on some of the tasks mentioned in this issue here https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor/issues/742 one of the key issues being the tests failing. We would definitely consider that to be of high priority. Thank you!! ‚úåÔ∏è
