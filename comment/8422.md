Hi Nicholas,  
These rigs are not nearly as indestructible as a soda bottle rig. The leg brackets are vulnerable to cracking when the legs are stressed, so I just printed a prototype without leg brackets. A pair of separate leg brackets will be bolted on. That bracket will be stronger, so it will work better. This approach also makes the upper frame much easier to print (almost no support is needed), which is an important consideration for wide distribution.  Although the final product will not be unbreakable, it will protect the camera very well even if damage is done to the rig on a hard landing.

I have not flown one of these yet, but I look forward to that after two full months of prototyping.
