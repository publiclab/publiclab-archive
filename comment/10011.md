All - thanks for a really great conversation about the future of MapKnitter.

Here's how I've decided to proceed for the time being:

* I am focusing on making the map viewing and editing interface more descriptive, interactive, and social.  This includes adding:
    * Public Lab-style tagging and commenting
    * Integration with Public Lab research notes
* In addition, I am working on merging and integrating the work that other GSoC students (Vidun and Anish) have already done to improve the MapKnitter experience.
* While I fully support moving the default MapKnitter viewing + editing paradigm to a "supermap"-centric view, rather than a "patch"-centric view, I am *not* focusing on implementing the "supermap" functionality right now.  I feel that this is (potentially) a significant task which is outside of the scope of my project.

I have already added full-featured tagging and commenting to MapKnitter maps and am in the progress of merging and integrating Anish's and Vidun's work - more to come soon in a separate research note.
