Hi Scott, Gerald and all. 

Thanks for all the comments! The Speck is currently not commercially available, but could be very soon. Please sign up for our mailing list to stay tuned (just select the Speck check-box): http://cmu.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=9ab233975f9af4c0b78f67a12&id=1c07baa302

Also, our Gateway software for the Speck is free and open-source, and available at: http://specksensor.org/software/

If you have any other questions about the Speck or want to inquire about borrowing a Speck for an interesting project/activity, please email us at speck@cmucreatelab.org

Cheers,
Bea
