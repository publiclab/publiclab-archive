Hi! Are you referring to this post? https://www.rtl-sdr.com/apt_color-add-false-color-to-black-and-white-noaa-apt-images/

Unfortunately that wasn't from me- it was another Sasha!

However to answer your query, open-weather apt (see link above) does not require any plug-ins as it is purely browser based, and can accept WAV files captured with SDR#, CubicSDR and most other SDR systems.
