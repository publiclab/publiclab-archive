Hi, you might find some answers at http://rifevideos.com/the_rife_microscopes_information_and_blueprint_page.html . This site has a wealth of info which may be of interest.

I think a powerful source of monochromatic light coupled with counter rotating prisms to select a specific wavelength might give sufficient illumination to have the subject microbes/virii fluoresce.

Good luck with your research.
