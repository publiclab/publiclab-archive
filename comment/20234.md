Thanks again for your comments.  Much of this is a work in progress but here is an update:  

**Do you have any information on the proportion of red light to NIR light produced by your LED combinations?**
The slide below provides typical LED spectra.   I would say the IR to VIS crossover is low but note I have not measured the LEDS to make sure.

**Ideally you would want to know the radiance in each band (how much energy is being delivered to the test surfaces). That will require special equipment, so you can substitute a measure of brightness. The goal would be to adjust the brightness of each color band (red and NIR) to match the proportion in sunlight (or sky light).**
I do not have radiance values.  One option to consider is a light detector located with the objects.   The Adafruit  detector below looks like it may provide a ratio reference but there may be something better.   It’s only 6 dollars!

**Do you have any information on the relative sensitivity of the camera sensor to red light versus NIR light? **
Yes,  see below for Raspberry PI v2 NoiR response, I assume this is a typical for other digital cameras.  Example spectral output for the  660, 850, and 940nm LEDS are also  added to the response  curve. 
 The article below has additional info:

**Even if you adjust the incoming light …….**
Looking at the graphs it seems the sensitivity difference is 3 (vis) to ir (1)at 850nm.  There may be several ways to compensate  for this: more/less LEDS, exposure control, filters, etc.  


**A solution which has been proposed is to acquire objects with…….**
Adjusting the gain settings is some thing I would like to try.


**A next step might be to characterize some of the objects in your test photos so you know how much of the incoming red and NIR are being reflected from them. You might already have some information about this for some of the objects you included (e.g., Rosco filters). But this will not solve the two unknown issue. The tool of choice to characterize the spectral reflectance of a surface is a spectrometer. The Public Lab type spectrometers are probably not sufficiently sensitive in the NIR to work well for this, and are also not well-suited for intensity measurements without the type of gain correction that Dave Stoft has done (https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/02-25-2015/plab-spectrometer-gain-correction).**

Its a problem that  photographic color references are not calibrated for the IR.  Believe this is something the could be done in the future.  In the meantime, you can get learn a lot by comparing objects to leaves, etc.   

**Unfortunately, you have two unknown variables. Both your incoming light (LEDs) and your camera sensitivity are unknown. So you will have to devise some clever protocol for solving for two unknowns.**

It may be unrealistic to expect a (low cost) simulator to provide absolute (with respect to LANDSAT) NDVI calibration.   However, it may be useful for  relative comparison of different systems.   

 I have tried using outdoor NDVI collection to scale the light levels for the simulator.  The two videos show NDVI images from  outdoors (with sunlight) and with the LED simulator.  Both videos use a Raspberry Pi NoIR camera and computer vision software to collect  NDVI  scenes at video frame rates.  I  can adjust the Vis/IR lighting in the simulator to mimic the outdoor results.   Picture below provides additional details but it is probably worth a separate post.

It’s also possible to compare a 2 picture (NIR/WHT) NDVI image using  the LED simulator and image sequencer.  In this case the  ‘stretched’ colormap image seems to be close to the computer vision NDVI LED simulator video.   (Note the pictures show I need to balance out the white light intensity.)  Need to learn  more about how image sequencer works and it may be possible  to get a closer match.

**You have not explained what your two figures represent. Each figure has seven images, and they apparently represent stages in the image sequencer process. It might help to have a caption which explained that there are two input photographs (left) and two images which result from processing (center), and then three images which result from other processing of the NDVI image (right). Some of the things I do not know about these figures are**

Sorry for the confusion!, I did not reference the processing sequence that was described in  this post: 
https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/05-30-2018/use-image-sequencer-for-ndvi-plant-analysis-with-2-images

I think we are in a transition period between https://infragram.org/ and https://publiclab.org/wiki/image-sequencer.  Image sequencer has more processing options and it may be necessary to describe the processing steps in more detail.  


**1 What is red blend?**
Blends the red channel from image 1(infrared)  and the green and blue channels of image 2 (visible RGB). 


**2 Why are there no arrows connecting the two input photos and the NDVI image?**
The slide refers to image sequencer processing steps. The image sequencer has NDVI as a single step and performs the (r-b)/(r+b) operation(from the red blend).



**3 What color channels (RGB) were used to make an NDVI image from the two photos?**

See [#1](/n/1) and 2



**4 What is the default colormap? **Not sure. I know there are still pushing out the documentation
**
5 What is the stretched colormap?** Not sure,  I believe it's ‘JET’ since it seems to match results from the computer program.


**1) What is the fastie colormap? ** The  fastie colormap is one of the few colormaps specifically designed for NDVI.   Thanks for this !  More info at: 
https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/08-26-2014/new-ndvi-colormap..  Ideally, image sequencer will add a  colormap overlay option so we can easily reference the NDVI scale.    I may add this to the NDVI computer program.

**2) How is NDVI derived from the input photos?  **The image sequencer website implies it’s a basic 
(r-b)/(r+b) operation.  It’s not clear if other processing steps are also included in the sequence step  and this would be good documentation to add.   


**My interpretation of the very high (close to 1.0) NDVI values in the red-NIR result is that the red photo was very dark (underexposed?) so the DNs in the red (and also green and blue) channels for the leaves and ND filters were close to zero. If the value for red is zero, then (NIR-red)/(NIR+red) evaluates to 1.0 regardless of the NIR value. The photos (or channels) used for both NIR and red must be well exposed but both must also be exposed with the same settings for f/stop, shutter speed, ISO, and gain.**

This may be OBE since I am using new light levels.   I may do this comparison again once I figure out how to do flat field correction.
