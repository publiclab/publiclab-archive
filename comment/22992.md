Out of the two posted above, when we were testing them out, I had a preference for [this one ](https://www.amazon.com/I-MU-Flexible-Gooseneck-Brightness-Gray-White/dp/B071Y3P8ZC/). It's currently unavailable, but perhaps they could be sourced from somewhere else. Also interesting to note, we had better success when the light wasn't directly over the sample, but rather when it illuminated from the side.
