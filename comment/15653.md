Hello ink14, we used Model 49i-PS Ozone Primary Standard (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/49IPS) to generate known concentrations of ozone and Model 49i Ozone Analyzer (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/49I?ICID=search-product) to analyze how much ozone was actually being generated from the generator. We put our MICS 2614 ozone sensors in a sealed chamber between the O3 Generator and O3 analyzer and measured their response to the amount of ozone passing through the sealed camber. We used a 9v battery and arduino datalogger to record their response. Do I make some sense?
