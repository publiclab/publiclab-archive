Re: direct vs. off teflon.  After I get and assemble my spectrometer kit (expected Monday) I can work on evaluating those options.  It might be a while before I can do that because I willl be out of town from Sept. 26 through Oct. 3.

It looks reasonable to use the spectrum you linked to for calibration.  I will seee if I can get that done later today or tomorrow.
