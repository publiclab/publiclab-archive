I'm sorry you found asking questions disrespectful as asking critical questions (questions which are critical to the analysis process) are just part of the process and should be expected.

The questions about dissimilarity still stand because there are a number of significant unexplained differences between the two plots when one would expect very little difference in both shape and peak center since the substance being tested is the same chemical.

Comparisons between devices are useful for this vary reason; when one does not get the same result, it is a prompt to find out why (and possibly correct the issue) so as to make better measurements. Observing that the two curves are "similar in some ways" does not address the underlying questions as to why they are not the same (or at least really close). Not finding out why, limits future the "comparison(s) on accuracy and precision" you referenced.
