Hey [@warren](/profile/warren) - Just realizing I never replied to your comment. 

I definitely think a small accessible evaluation (haven't heard that phrase before, but I think I understand what it means) would be useful to the world. I've been thinking about what the design of that could look like, and... well much depends on how rigorous we want our methods to be. For example...

Let's say we bought 10 of each of these. We recruited volunteers to test a home or real place (which we know has lead, or at least we know has a high risk of lead being present). And then we let them use these. We then pay for an official tester so that we know the 'truth' to compare it against... That'd be ideal as we'd be testing these with real users in a real world setting. BUT this would be a lot to coordinate. 

A smaller effort would involve something a bit more lab-like and controlled. We have a painted surface and water with known quantities of lead. Finding those things to test against is a rate determining factor here, but is doable. Actually maybe we do this first, and then see if there's momentum building or an argument towards the larger one?
