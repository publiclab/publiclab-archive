Hi Dave and Jeff

Thanks for your feedback. I really liked the idea of using over-exposure to our advantage to create a high dynamic range spectrum. Though I personally love to work on these features, a recent proposal drew my attention, which overlaps to a large extent with my proposal.

Pascal's proposal ( http://publiclab.org/notes/PascalW/03-11-2014/gsoc-proposal-spectralworkbench ) is well researched and he started working on the problems we are discussing here, in this thread. I found this proposal to be promising and I don't want his work to go waste.

This leaves me with only Offline SWB to work on ( :-O ) and some other less-important features. Seems like I will have to explore other ideas and propose a much useful contribution to any of the Public Lab projects.
