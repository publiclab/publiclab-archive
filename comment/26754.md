If the device connects directly to WiFi, then I think a specially configured VPN router might be the only way to keep it from being able to see location:

But also, if you trust them to not collect even though they technically can, then from [their privacy policy](https://www2.purpleair.com/policies/privacy-policy):

heh, not exactly sure what they means, here...! but might be something that contacting support could clarify :)
