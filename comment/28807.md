Please do not take this wrong.  Your work is impressive.  But part of science is asking questions, including questions on the testing done. So here are a few questions.  So why was ORP testing done? This test is usually used for swimming pools.  Why would it be used on Lake Ponch?  By the way, a suitable answer is, "it's what I had available".  What calibration was done on the pH meter and where is that data recorded?    Traceability is always an issue that will be questioned and calibration would fit in the traceability category.  Overall, your data is very good.  Keep up the good work!
