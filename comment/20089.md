[@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) or [@liz](/profile/liz) - Sagarpreet had wanted to include some EPA datasets on this combined map (see a bit more here: https://publiclab.org/notes/sagarpreet/06-06-2018/leaflet-environmental-layer-library)

Are there any that come to mind that might be useful contextual data in a many-layers combined map of environmental issues? 

https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/upstreamdownstream-search-service and

https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/navigation-delineation-service

seem to show some code samples for Leaflet, and they show watershed delineation and even which streams are upstream or downstream... cool!

Any EDGI datasets that would be good to display?
