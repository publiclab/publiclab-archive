My  teams collection of microplastics along the Mississippi River was not what I had imagined. I had hoped that dipping the BabyLegs in the water would be a much more smooth operation. However, in order to capture microplastics, we had to manipulate it along the water's surface. Microplastics were also not as obvious as I had expected. The most common items I observed were water bottles and aluminum cans. The bottles might take anything from 20 to 500 years to decompose, while the aluminum cans could take anywhere from 200 to 500 years to decompose.
