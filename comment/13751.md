[@warren](/profile/warren) - According to the paper that figure is lifted from, you will get increasing fluorescence intensity (or quantum yield), as you increase the wavelength of excitation. I think this makes perfect sense because longer wavelengths of light are less energetic. The less energy you put in, the less total fluorescence you get.

It appears that there is also an affect on the bandwidth of emission. I think it has to do with the amount of (collisional) energy transfer you are allowing for. When you use a shorter excitation wavelength, your excited chromophores have a higher probability of crashing into a chromophore and giving it enough energy to fluoresce. The more of this collisional energy transfer you have, the more red-shifted your spectrum is going to be, because each one of these transfers results in some energy-loss. The more concentrated your sample is, the more of these collisions you will have, so you get a greater red-shift. When you dilute your sample, you reduce the number of collisions and you get a blue shift. This explains the dilution effect we have been looking at.

The authors of this paper say that "at short excitation wavelengths, there are significant variations in the spectra for different crude oils, particularly for the neat samples." So theoretically, we would want to use the shortest possible excitation wavelength so that we could distinguish between different crude oils. However, the detection bandwidth of our sensors if obviously going to be a factor here. To my mind, as long as the lower limit of detection for our sensor is stuck at 400 nm, a 400 nm excitation wavelength remains the ideal choice. If we excite at 400 nm, practically all of our fluorescent emissions are going to fall within the range that we are best able to detect. If we excite our sample at a shorter wavelength, the emissions are going to be shifted into the UV, out of the range where we are able to detect them.
