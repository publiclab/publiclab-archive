Thanks, Liz! Hope to meet soon with the Army Corps re: continuing the project. What is super interesting is that Black wall island is directly adjacent to this island, and they're both being remade. Yellow Bar is a full ACE contracted job, while Black wall is going to be entirely planted by community members. So next step is to get some comparative analysis imagery between the two islands, hopefully during planting day!
