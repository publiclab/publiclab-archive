These are great questions!!! I think DVDs are consistent but have no evidence to support it. I do think they're close enough for your spacer idea to work and I think it's really worthwhile. Would you post a prototype?

  

Another source might work although our autocalibration is based around a CFL. Maybe a green and red laser together could work? I believe you can do a manual calibration by manually entering a tag like "linearCalibration:\_\_\_\_\_\_" or something. If you want to post a spectrum that has two known peaks i can try to help!

  

Thanks, great ideas and questions!!!
