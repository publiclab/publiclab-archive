One inexpensive way to do that is with an rtlsdr dongle.  You might want to check the rtlsdr subreddit. The dongles cost about $20.  Thats assuming you already have a computer.

The next question is whether you want to copy a polar orbiting satellite or a geostationary.  A polar orbiting is easiest.  It would require an antenna ( possibly included with the dongle), maybe an lna, and maybe an FM filter.  The software to do this is generally free, but it takes a while to get used to.  Look up some articles on rtl-sdr.com, as a starting point.  I can hear the polar orbiters with no problems, but interference from FM stations is common and may cause you problems.

The geostationary orbiters take a lot more effort.  A modified 2.4 ghz dish, lnb, and bias t will be needed ( at least).  I can hear the sun, but have yet to hear one of the geosats.  Oh well....

Good luck with your project!
