Hello Ned, thank you for all your work on this subject.

Currently I am looking for low-cost materials that can be used as reliable standards for NDVI calibration. Two paints options I came across look possible due to their high reflectance and diffusion properties:

1) Barium sulfate + white latex paint -  Various combinations were tested by Dr. Nick Knighton and Dr. Bruce Bugbee from USU with quite promising results:
Knighton, N. and B. Bugbee. 2005. A Mixture of Barium Sulfate and White Paint is a Low-Cost Substitute Reflectance Standard for Spectralon. Techniques and Instruments. Paper 11. http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cpl_techniquesinstruments/11

2) Titanium dioxide based paints (~94% reflectance from at least 600-1100 nm) - I'm not sure how various "titanium white" paints that you can buy at general craft stores would compare, but it might be worth testing too. This was also tested in-lab:
Noble, S.D., A. Boeré, T. Kondratowicz, T.G. Crowe, R.B. Brown, and D.A. Naylor. 2008. Characterization of a low-cost diffuse reflectance coating. Can. J. Remote Sens. 34:68–76.

And from Chemours: https://www.chemours.com/Titanium_Technologies/en_US/assets/downloads/Ti-Pure-for-coatings-overview.pdf

Do you think trying any of these would be worthwhile (in terms of effort, cost, ease of production and consistency)? I will update again if I end up trying some of these.
