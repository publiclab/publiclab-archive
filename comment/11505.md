I am going to contribute a recent memory. This is a picture of Brent and Joan, two workshop participants, in their Zodiac helping me salvage my kite and camera after it took an unexpected nosedive into the cold and frigid waters of the Prince Rupert Harbor. Why does a failed attempt along with lost and damaged equipment sit up there as a favorite memory? Since becoming a member of Public Lab, my life has taken a number of strange and fantastic turns. Inspired by Public Lab's projects, I hatched a foolhardy idea to map a proposed oil pipeline in Canada using kites and weather balloons. Miraculously, I got the funding to do it and am now traveling across Canada, meeting people, hearing their stories, and leading workshops on grassroots mapping. Through my Public Lab experience, I am always meeting kind, generous people. The type who will brave choppy waters to help a complete stranger retrieve a doomed kite and camera and then drive her around town in search of a replacement camera. There are so many similar stories like this one circulating within the Public Lab community and is why I love being a part of Public Lab!
