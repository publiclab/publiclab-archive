Corrections made re: order of operations, thank you Chris for a sharp eye and a clearer memory of how to do basic arithmetic! And you said you couldn't code.

It's not AS good as it was. But I think it still works, and that I could've worked harder to get the images to match by using different stretches. Perhaps if we build a really solid levels-stretching interface, this can work. Thoughts?

Regarding HSV color wheel -- it's an imperfect way to do color mapping for a variety of reasons. Here, i used it because we can quickly get color within an Infragrammar approach. I think an Infragrammar version of linear colormapping, where you can map it to a lookup table, perhaps selected from a dropdown of different LUTs, would be much better and we should code that up pronto.
