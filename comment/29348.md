Hi all, 
Update so far, I am preparing for a proposal for a research grant and have been researching articles for my literature review. Mechanical carousels designs that I have found are more complicated petri dish carousels however the overall concept of the automated carousel is the same for my project. These are some of the carousels that I have looked at, check them out!
