The blue channel display is a good addition. It is not only a good diagnostic, but it helps everybody understand how the whole infrablue thing works. Maybe there could be some informative text there (eventually hidden in a pop-up): "Healthy foliage should appear strangely bright in the image from the red channel because that channel is dominated by near infrared light which is strongly reflected from growing leaves." And: "The image from the blue channel should look like a normal black and white photo. The difference between the blue and red channel images is translated directly into NDVI values -- the greater the difference between matching pixels, the higher the NDVI value for that pixel."
