 Yes, ion exchange is a good idea.  Usually, it's cation exchange, anion exchange, and actived charcoal, followed by the particle filter.  A conductivity meter usually follows as a sanity check.  You have to do testing per appropriate sections of the USP/ISO for sterile water and/ or purified water.  Plus testing for the solution. Anything you can do to extend the life of the ion exchange will save money!
