I got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002B8UR0M/ref=sc_pgp__m_A19DY5EK03NION_1?ie=UTF8&m=A19DY5EK03NION&n=&s=&v=glance">five pack of 4LR44 6v batteries </a> for $4.74 incl shipping (the price has since dropped).  I haven't tried them yet, but two of them fit in a AA holder (tight fit, but very convenient).  Also, if the no-relay configuration works, one of them should power the whole deal.
