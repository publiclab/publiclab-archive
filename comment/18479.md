This is such a great post about the [#shinyei](/tag/shinyei) sensor and its limitations and how best to work with it. We'd love to feature your work with the shinyei in particular -- would you be willing to break out that section as its own post? 

See some related info on different sensors here -- i imagine your work compiling helpful notes on the Shinyei apply to many of them too! https://publiclab.org/q/15751
