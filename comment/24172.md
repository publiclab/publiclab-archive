 [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996), can you say a bit more about why we wouldn't want comments under the pages?  I like the feedback and discussion about it.  Of course, you can leave comments on a wikipage when you click on the talk bubble that leads to /wiki/page_name/comments, but it's a bit more hidden.
