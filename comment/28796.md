Kenneth Warren's The American Steel Industry, 1850â€“1970: A Geographical Interpretation provides a good overview of North Eastern US mining history

For the more detailed local Maine mining history I would look at historical rail maps available from USGS and the Library of Congress, focusing on the rail spurs in  more remote areas

These historical maps will give you the forensic geography "key words" needed to dig up more specialized local histories such as for the Katahdin Iron Works

Don't forget the national geological surveys that often have historical mining data

Good luck with your data mining !
