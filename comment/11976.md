i wonder if it really would make sense then to base the navigation controls off of a flight controller IMU like the one I've been (very slowly) developing at- http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/08-05-2014/aerial-mapping-drone-for-under-60.  Something like MultiWii would be easily modified since it is based on Arduino.  Although the current iteration of my UAV project has abandoned the 8Bit Arduino in favor of a 32bit STM chip, it does include a cheap IMU called the GY-80, which includes a barometric pressure sensor, a digital compass and the MPU6050 10-DOF gyro/accel combo.

  At this point however, I would strongly advise AGAINST using an STM over Arduino even if the 8Bit system severely limits capabilities...  The enormous resources provided by the Arduino user-community outweighs the performance increase in ALMOST every situation I've yet tried...
