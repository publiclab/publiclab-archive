In pursuing the image registration problem, some more bugs were found in SimpleCV that cause some colorspace image formats to get accidently inverted during geometrical transformations.  (Really the fault occurs because of row-major vs. column-major array formatting contentions - a tired old example of computational conventions that don't "really matter" but no one can agree on!)

Don't get me wrong, I am glad that the SimpleCV project exsists and I will continue using it as long as the bug fixes keep coming.  Its because of these silly format incompatibilities and the awful legacy of C/C++ syntax that Python OpenCV library is not already simple!
