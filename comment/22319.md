This might be a question for [@Willie](/profile/Willie) who developed the DustDuino project. 

[@mathew](/profile/mathew) has a nice overview of optical dust sending [here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/optical-pm) and towards the bottom lists some of the different sensors and monitors on the market. 

What are the sources of particulate matter your interested in? and what are you hoping that the data produced from these monitors will tell you?
