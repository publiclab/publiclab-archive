No models or measurements;
this may help, if the description of the thread type is what you need:

T-Rings for Questar Telescopes Only - Astronomics
https://www.astronomics.com/t-rings-for-questar-telescopes-only_c300.a...â€Ž
The 42mm x 1mm pitch male threads of the camera coupling set allow the coupling to be connected directly to camera bodies using a Pentax screw thread lens ...


 I could buy and send you one of these adapters (they're available much cheaper than this Amazon listing, it's just handy):  http://www.amazon.com/Bower-ABSPK-Pentax-Mount-Adapter/dp/B005G2HTNI

Those take the old Pentax screw mount lenses and allow them to mount on newer bayonet-type cameras.
