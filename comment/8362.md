Hi All,

Great discussion here.  It sounds to me like designing the breakout board for the Visualight would be an excellent student project, and could also be useful as a thermal flashlight design.  It could be used as an external I2C breakout board for use with an Arduino.  For that reason, I think it'd be cool to have the student project be to design this breakout board along with a footprint for an RGB through-hole LED -- it could then e.g. be a smaller, independently useful "thermal flashlight breakout for your Arduino" reward in a Kickstarter campaign.  

Meanwhile, the thermal flashlight boards I designed arrived over the weekend -- here's a photo:

I'm not even sure that it works yet, as I haven't tried populating the board; and I don't yet know how bright the LEDs will be.  But if it does work, it'll have the advantage of combining LEDs, battery recharging circuitry, and a coin battery (or an external battery vis a JST connector) all on a single PCB.  It's a surface mount design, so (agreeing with Jack's comment) it's not something you'd want to ask most people to assemble themselves.   Depending on how much the Visualight costs, I think it'd tend to be cheaper (and simpler, production-wise) to have everything integrated on one small board -- you don't need to worry about how to connect the external sensor board to the Visualight, or how to include a battery.  That said, those are problems that could be fun for the user to solve themselves, too, depending on what sort of arrangement they want.  

A growing thermal flashlight ecosystem! :)

I might also be unreasonably excited about the fact that the design that just arrived has an on-board piezo buzzer, too :)
