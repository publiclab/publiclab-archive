Also noting, as I commented in https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/04-22-2019/user-interface-projects-update-and-dial-osc-project-recap, that this Style Guide has expanded upon and refined work from the DIAL UI projects (in that link), and we may need to update those designs a bit. 

But fundamentally the Style Guide incorporates, refines upon, and "generalizes" a lot of the work that went into that project. So they largely still stand, but the Style Guide is an attempt to make a more holistic guidance document from them that can be applied to other pages as well!
