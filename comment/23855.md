It is quite easy to build the environmental data logger you describe for $15. All of the parts for a [Mini Pearl Logger](https://publiclab.org/wiki/mini-pearl-logger) can be ordered from eBay for $12.00. This device will log temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure every minute or every hour for many months on 3 AAA batteries. 

For an additional $3.00 you can add an OLED display which can display the current time, temperature, and humidity. This can make it a useful household device even if the residents will not use the data being saved on the microSD card. 

The Mini Pearl Logger uses an Arduino Pro Mini ($2.00). There might be no advantage to building a logger from a less expensive bare 328p chip. The Mini Pearl Logger seems to do exactly what you want and is a tested solution with complete assembly instructions and open source software.
