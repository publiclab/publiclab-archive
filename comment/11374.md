Hi Gretchen,
We are making no attempt to degas the sulfuric acid solution.  First, we used relatively dilute acid which we assume will behave more like other aqueous solutions (you probably know that concentrated H2SO4 is pretty unlike other aqueous solutions in terms of things like viscosity, water absorption, acid behavior, etc.).  We chose H2SO4 because it is non-volitile.  We originally used acetic acid, but vapor transfer affected the pH of the test solution, altering the voltammetry.  Second, we assume that the acid solution is equilibrated with air before the experiment starts, so passing air over the top will not affect the composition.  
  We did try passing argon through the system at one point.  We were having trouble with noise in the electronics and the fear was that running the pump was causing the noise.  I dont recall what the actual problem was but we did work it out eventually.  I do not recall that we saw any difference between runs with argon as the carrier gas and air.  My greatest concern about air involved oxidation of the sulfur while in the initial alkaline solution.   Once it hits the acid, becomes neutral H2S and gets into the gas phase, then I think it is pretty stable.  If not, then that kind of chemistry has to be happening in airborne H2S and that is what we are modeling anyway.
