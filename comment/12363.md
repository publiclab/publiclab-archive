[@chrowe](/profile/chrowe) Awesome estimates. I love that utility box. I'll write a longer response later but quick thought... I should maybe reframe this question to: 

`Can a Linux board be cost effective for outdoor environmental monitoring?` 

And then we break it out into three scenarios:

1. Short range WiFi
2. Long distance WiFi bridge
3. Cellular GSM
