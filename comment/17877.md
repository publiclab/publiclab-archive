This is great! Love the photos. Was thinking if there was a cheap product we could substitute for the LED and battery pack, to save a few steps, but not really sure if it's worth it. I saw these for ~$4.60 on Amazon, which is a bit pricey I guess:

But maybe if we make a kit, we could bulk order them.
