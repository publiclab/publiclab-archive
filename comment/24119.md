 Hi! [@bsugar](/profile/bsugar) 
You are correct in that you would file this as an issue. I'll answer the rest of your questions directly but you may want to also checkout [this guide on getting started](https://publiclab.org/wiki/contributing-to-public-lab-software)
2) You would file the issue first and state that you are working on it in the description. Other contributors (like myself) will label it as an enhancement. When you've done your changes and open a PR, there will be guidelines in the auto-completed part of the description that will ask you to mention @publiclab/reviewers and to check that you have followed the guidelines in the above link to the best of your abilities. 
3) I've found the public lab contributor community to be one of the most helpful and encouraging communities I've ever been a part of on github. So if you need any help, mention me other any other public lab contributors and we'll try and help out. 

Hope that helps!
