You can get gratings from places like Thor Labs or Edmond Optics.  For a uv lamp, I would look at Thor labs or spectrometer vendors like Ocean Optics, BWTek, StellarLabs.  For help with the design I recommend looking at the material posted by flatcat (https://hackaday.io/project/1279-ramanpi-raman-spectrometer/log/9583-how-to-build-a-spectrometer).
