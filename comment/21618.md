Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry, Fourth Edition, David L. Nelson and Michael, M. Cox. WHFreeman & Co, NY. Chapter 6, Sections 6.3 (Enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism) and 6.4 (Examples of Enzymatic reactions), pages 202-225.  The bit about chymotrypsin starts on page 213.
