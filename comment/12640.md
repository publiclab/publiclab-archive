Hg (II), Hg (I), and Hg (0) are oxidation states of mercury.  Hg (II) and Hg (0) are by far the most common forms of Hg in the environment -- Hg (I) is quite rare.  However, I'm not sure if it would be prominent in compound fluorescent lights.  I was under the impression that CFLs used Hg (0), since it is fairly inert whereas Hg (II) is reactive and will form compounds, but I'm not 100% sure.  The Hg atomic absorptions spectrometers monitor at 253.7 nm, but alas, that is outside the range of our spectrometer.
