Okay, now I understand the question. It's really helpful to know what data logger hardware you will have. You will have a Nano Logger Kit. You will also have a Mini Pearl Logger Kit, but that will require several hours of soldering, loading code, etc., before it does anything. The Nano Logger Kit can be snapped together in five minutes, a sketch is pre-loaded on the Nano, and the real time clock (RTC) has been set. So you can expect some success collecting data.

The first activity to do with the Nano Logger is to assemble it and connect it to a computer. If you can drive the Arduino IDE (or the new web based version), you should be able to see data from the RTC and the BMP280 pressure and temperature sensor displayed in real time on the computer monitor. 

The second activity might be to connect the included battery pack (4 AA required) and place the logger where the barometric pressure and temperature are likely to change over the course of a day or two (until the batteries die). You won't know whether it is working until you remove the microSD card and see what's on it.

The third activity might be to power the Nano Logger with the included DC converter (plugged into the wall) and let it log data for as long as you want. If everything goes well, there will be interesting data on the SD card.

All three of these activities are outlined in the included assembly and use guide for the Nano Logger Kit ([see it here](http://kaptery.com/guides/)). 

Another activity might be to change the interval at which the Nano Logger logs data. It comes programmed to log every five seconds. To change that, you must have a copy of the sketch that is on the Nano which is [conveniently available here](http://kaptery.com/guides/). Open that sketch in the Arduino IDE, edit it, save, it, and load it onto the Nano Logger via USB.

While you are editing the sketch, you might also want to edit the entry for sea level barometric pressure in the sketch. Find the current value at a weather site, find it in the sketch, and change it. The sketch uses that value to compute elevation from barometric pressure.

The BMP280 sensor is not waterproof. It reads barometric pressure and temperature. If you carry the Nano Logger around with you while you hike up a mountain (even one with its top removed), it will serve as an altimeter. When you get back you can graph your hike in two dimensions (time and elevation). 

Another good activity might be parsing the data file saved on the microSD card. The file is nothing but numbers and commas. The workflow to get something meaningful from that file will depend on your computer, your software, and your experience getting something meaningful from data files.

A successful group activity might benefit from a few extras: spare AA batteries, backup microSD card, backup microSD card reader, longer USB cable, longer I2C Dupont wires. You need a very small flathead screwdriver to connect the logger to the battery pack or DC converter (Don't let a screwdriver near the logger when the power source is on).

I expect  a full report.
