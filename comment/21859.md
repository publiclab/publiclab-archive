 You are correct that your multi-day observation will present some problems. It is possible that doing a custom white balance on each day will compensate for the day-to-day variation in light quality. But I am not aware that this has ever been tested. Even if it worked, light quality varies throughout the day, minute by minute if there are clouds. 

A better way to compensate for varying light conditions is to include two or more calibration targets in each photo. If you know the proportion of 660nm to 850nm light reflected from those targets, you can adjust the photos before they are used to compute NDVI. Ned's plugin for Fiji does all the math.

Targets can be expensive, but are probably worth it in this case. You can make your own targets if you know someone with a spectrometer. All you need to know is if you shine the same brightness of 660nm and 850nm light on the targets, how much of each is reflected. 

I don't think this calibration process will completely solve the problem of contamination of the red channel with NIR. But it might reduce the importance of that problem.

Make sure you know what your camera does with custom white balance information when camera RAW images are captured. The RAW data itself ignores white balance, but sometimes the white balance information is saved with the file and can be applied to the RAW data afterwards. When that happens, the resulting photo is no longer a RAW image.
