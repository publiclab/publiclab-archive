What we were taught in industrial statistic s is that often times bimodal curves work themselves out into normal curves.  How?  Well, even if you have a bimodal distribution, by the time you get QA sampling done, and the averaging on this, it will often look like a normal distributio n.

As for montoring, I'm sorry but no.  I'm already  working on a turbidity project that is going slower than I would like.  Mostly because of work going on around the house.  Maybe I'm the future...
