These graphs look like there's a log normal pattern to them with spikes that break from the log normal distribution.

If you can estimate the parameters for a log normal distribution for some given graph / sample, you should be able to run an error function and highlight the peaks which rise or fall too far from that distribution.

I never read about how to fit models, it's all on-the-job training. I lack links or resources, but here's info about log normal distribution:
