Hummm, I think we can use your idea and implement a new method to get "recent contributors for the current bounding box".

We already have the method _tagNearbyNodes_ that searches nearby nodes with respect to given latitude, longitute and tags. Maybe we can implement _tagNearbyPeople_... What do you think? I can work on it.
