The vertical scale is purely relative, representing the combined RGB responses where 100% represents the clipping level for any of the RGB channels. The camera RGB data comes from R,G,B filters which each have their own spectral response. Combined, they mimic the response of the eye to provide a 'broadband' spectral response (though un-calibrated for intensity). Generally, a broadband response is what is wanted. While just the red response could be used separately, the red (or green or blue) sensitivity curve has significantly greater change vs wavelength than the combined RGB value; and so would need to be calibrated unless only single wavelength relative measurements were wanted. The combined RGB curve is an easy first-order approximation for broadband sensitivity. Intensity calibration can improve the flatness; though SWB does not yet do that.
