Wow, *amazing* note.  Thanks so much for putting all this so nicely together, [@mathew](/profile/mathew)!!!

Still digging in, but quick thoughts:

- The 6-32 screws with \# 6 rubber washers look great to me.  The readings I've done indicate (I think) that for a two-probe design (like this one), a trick that helps to diminish stray field effects (electric field lines that extend beyond the space between the two screws, and interact with e.g. the sides of a calibration container) is to choose probe size and probe spacing that differ significantly -- i.e., it's best (perhaps) to use smaller screws spaced further apart, or larger screws spaced more closely.  Exactly as you're doing in the photos above. I'll likely try 6-32 or a comparable size in my next trials -- as you say, it's the easiest to source in the local hardware store.  

- it'd be nice to also come up with a nice way of coupling our temperature probe to the water temp that is as easy to implement and render waterproof as the screws + washers designs shown above. Perhaps adding a third screw, and attaching the temp sensor inside the bottle to the screw (somehow), would accomplish this ...
