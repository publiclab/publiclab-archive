Here's a real spectrum which I stored on the SD card. It is of potassium permanganate. Because there is a very strong absorbance 500-580 nm and the sample is transparent elsewhere it is a tough spectrum to obtain experimentally due to random scattering off the diffraction grating.
There is some internal compensation for the scattering effect but due to limited processing power (the 16F1788 has an 8-bit processor) the correction is far from perfect.
It seems I can only upload JPG images so the spectrum has some JPG artifacts as well which were not present in the original GIF format.
