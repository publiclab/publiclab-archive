I was thinking today that in searching, it's often very helpful to be able to see:

* the author (if it's a note)
* the # of stars a result has
* maybe how recently it was updated or created?

in order to know better if it's a good match for what you're searching for. Maybe this can be factored into the plan. Thanks!
