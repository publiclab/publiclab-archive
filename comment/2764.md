Hi! I didn't realize it was a kit -- i thought you'd built it yourself from scratch. In this case the slit is probably correct since it's been laser cut as part of the kit. Your assembly looks great! Was the spectrum of a compact fluorescent lamp? Can you upload just a photo you take through it while pointed at such a lamp?

Awesome to see one of these in the wild!
