Ok, still a mystery; but I'll bet it's something simple that's overlooked. Let's double-check the obvious. In room light, the webcam by itself should give you a typical webcam-image of things -- the desk, can of soup, etc and should have an obvious focal point. (However, it will not be a sharp focal point as the DOF is large. Also, the idea is to focus on the slit, but it's a webcam so it will still be a little fuzzy (noisy + 640x480 resolution). Right? Next, the DVD grating should be about as close to the webcam as possible (on the older model, it was actually mounted to the web cam housing.). RIght? Next, there should be no extraneous light sources to the grating and camera -- just the light from the slit. (Ideally the webcam is parallel to the diffraction grating and that pair is at 45 deg to the slit. Note: I disagree with what the kit shows.) If the paper enclosure is closed, that should be good enough. Right? If you can, make a simple baffle out of cardboard or something with 2-in or so home in it. Place that between the flourescent light and the spectrometer -- at a distance from the spectrometer. The idea is to reduce your big tube effective area down to a small "CFL-like" light source -- i.e. to eliminate light sources from other angles.
