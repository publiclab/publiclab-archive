[@warren](/profile/warren) Hi, I wanted to ask if you have encountered collimation slits that were not perfectly parallel (i.e. in a slight V shape tapering to close). I want to try this as I should then be able to pick optimal width based on the image height (I want to use a parallel diffraction grating so the lines should be straight and easy to adjust). Do you think that would be a sensible thing to try?
