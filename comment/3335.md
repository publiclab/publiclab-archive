Very cool. Have you tried making a "set" of your spectra to display them together?

So your test demonstrates that they're different, and it can likely distinguish real from false (interesting to test with a double blind test) but does it tell us anything about why the fake one is different? Presumably it also has alcohol in it, but a different blend of colorants and flavorings?
