Can we digitize a 240x320 analog video signal using an standard audio jack? 

A mac laptop captures a maximum of two cannels (stereo) at 96khz, with a 24-bit samplng rate on its internal soundcard.  is that good enough?

240x320= 76800 pixels, fewer than the 96khz samples.  I doubt that 24 bits of depth are required-- 8 or 16 bits per pixel would probably do fine.  So a one frame per second image is possible.

a stereo signal could carry a synch signal (indicating where each line ends) in one channel and a video signal in the other.  It seems a laptop should be capable of transmitting and digitizing a low-fi, low-speed video signal!  that is great news, as very little electronics, beyond amplification, are therefore required to generate a video signal out of a mechanical TV, and all the processing can be performed in software.
