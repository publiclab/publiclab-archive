Hi Dave

Sorry. I somehow missed this comment.

Yes, You are right with your steps to be taken. And, I think I planned to take the same steps (along with designing modules) so that independent and effective development can take place.

I am looking into the Macros module. I think we should be exploit it to port most of the required functionalities for both off and on line use.

As usual, you are great with your insights. 

Thanks,
Sreyanth
