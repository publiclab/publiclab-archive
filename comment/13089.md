Chris - The relationships are curvilinear but  my preference is to try and figure out how to "correct" the JPEG pixel values to create a linear relationship. I'm still not certain how effective that approach will be. I have tried fitting more than two points using polynomials (mostly 1st degree) and had some success but that approach would do best with four or more points.
