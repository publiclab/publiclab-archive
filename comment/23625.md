**Idea 1:** While kicking off a collaborative session or training on air sensor placement, three or more Simple Air Sensors could be held by different people so everyone can see.

We could use a vacuum cleaner or candle (depending on scale, and being careful -- dust masks, and/or working outdoors), and then see how fast each sensor, at different distances, senses the dust. Does the nearby one detect faster, or get a stronger reading? Repeat with different distances and types of dust.
