the large scale image is <a href="http://fastie.net/Bin/12WarnerVIS/WarnerLkVis7075.JPG">here</a>, 2736x3648 pixels.  The patch of Trapa that I "trained" on and the patch in the upper center really do have significantly different colors. (I made another graphic to illustrate this, but it looks like I can't post this here).  On the right side of that image, on the clear water, I seem to be seeing reflections of the clouds--do  you agree?  Could it be that the cloud cover was so non-uniform that the patch of Trapa in the upper image and my training patch had different illumination?
