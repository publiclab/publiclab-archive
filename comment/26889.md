Yes I went thru the logs and it appears that the exporter failed, likely out of memory because these exports are so high resolution (84k x 84k).
[@warren](/profile/warren) has taken note and we aim for the exporter to alert the user when it fails in this way. I suggest you try to tweak the settings to export in a lower resolution.
