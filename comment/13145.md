Several years ago I was thinking of how to build a DIY integrating sphere/monochromator setup but never pursued it. You would want something other than just a shroud. I was thinking of an old basket ball with the inside coated with a matte white paint or perhaps even an inexpensive teflon paint. You need a surface that will reflect nearly 100% very diffusely. You also need to have some way to very accurately measure the intensity of the light (from a stable light source) in the integrating sphere. Most LEDs emit a fairly broad spectrum and the cut-offs are not very abrupt so they aren't ideal. It would be neat to see what someone could put together and then it could be compared with a lab setup. In the meantime a calibration protocol using targets seems to be the next best thing.
