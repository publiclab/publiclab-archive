sorry to blow up the comments! here is another project that *doesn't use any power* to increase diffusion of air to the root system https://www.airy.de/ its basically just a fancy plastic sheathing with vents on the bottom outside of a plastic slotted inner pot not unlike the 25 cent one i posted above, but retailing for 75 eruos. I do like that it doesn't use electricity, but don't believe that the diffusion is 8x better than a regular plant, while the pump versions claim 10x better.  I'm wondering about a system that could be powered by temperature differential (with ice cubes or a piece of metal kept out in the sun or something) to move air through the pot without electricity.
