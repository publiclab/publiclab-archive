Dan's response in the accompanying thread to this note in the discussion forum gave me an idea about retrieving the Glider in an ocean/large lake environment...  What if the Glider could be configured to go into a "retrieval mode" where it surfaces and emits a locator signal via AIS?  As readers may or may not be aware, I've been working on a low-cost method of receiving AIS signals at- http://publiclab.org/notes/ajawitz/06-11-2015/raspberry-pi-as-marine-traffic-radar.  However, I know very little about what it takes to actually TRANSMIT...  One thing I do know is there are many different classes of AIS transmissions assigned to different uses.  So big commercial ships will use "Class A" transmissions, smaller vessels will use "Class B", Aids to Navigation use a dedicated class, search and rescue etc...  AFAIK, one of these specifications has been set aside for "Scientific Research" but further information is hard to come by (chances are it has some kind of obscure acronym)...
   Anyway, I'm picturing something akin to the [Slocum Glider](http://www.webbresearch.com/slocumglider.aspx) where the tail of the vehicle can double as a flag/antenna in retrieval mode-

 Or like this Glider from the University of Washington-

  Challenges-  AFAIK the SDR revolution only really extends to receiving radio signals and transmitting them is still quite complicated in terms of hardware and regulatory approvals...  The closest thing to an SDR that can both receive and transmit is the [HackRF](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/) but at over $300 this still hasn't quite hit the "affordable" mark...  

 Dan- Considering your background in both Glider research and amateur radio do you know anything about AIS specs for scientific research applications?  If not can you recommend a good resource or place to start looking?  Assuming the regulatory process itself doesn't prevent the development of a low-cost AIS transmitter for research purposes, are there any obvious reasons why such a device would be technically impossible?
