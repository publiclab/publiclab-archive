well, yeah that is absolutely true, red cabbage  contents Anthocyanin  which is a perfect universal indicator(in fact , I use it as ph indicator for titrations in my  lab), unfortunately , this is just a pH indicator , chemistry is more complicated than that and there are a lot of different indicator (redox, pH...).Test and indicators are studied and developed by analytical chemists.Anyway thank you for your opinion and post! , and if you want to learn chemistry i would recommend you to buy a basic chemistry book( inorganic and organic chemistry, structures, molecule interaction, reactions,thermochemistry,equilibrium,ph and redox) with exercises and all of that.
Please, excuse my english
