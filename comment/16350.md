Yes, actually if you wanted to try to install an external module like https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor/ or https://github.com/publiclab/inline-markdown-editor and try building them and familiarizing yourself with:

1. how to build the source
2. how testing works
3. how they integrate with `plots2`

that would be a great start. Then you might consider building a static version of your work to date in a folder, as in the examples on the above projects -- and getting your code from `plots2` running on those static page examples. What do you think?

Of course you can also just plan out these steps as part of your proposal, before doing them.
