The surface mount connector has plastic pins protruding on the bottom to help with mechanical rigidity. 

<a href="//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/189/original/SMconnectorF.pdf"><i class="icon icon-file"></i> SMconnectorF.pdf</a>  Click on the box in the upper left corner and then read the text in the yellow caution.  You might need to update to a new version of Adobe Reader since this is a 3D image.  The image is from the DigiKey URL [@donblair](/profile/donblair) provided for the receptacle in a comment above.

It could be hot glued or zip tied by the user if needed.  The surface mount will save a few cents over the thru hole.  I like the socket over the pins because it is easy to test something by just pushing a wire into the connector.
