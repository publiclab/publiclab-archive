Interesting observations. My guess is that IF the camera's sensor responded in a purely linear fashion, the over exposure would be white as you'd expect. Since the diffraction grating doesn't care about light intensity, my guess is that the camera's internal AGC (automatic gain control) is working to protect the sensor electronics and attenuating the signal which gets converted into the RGB channels. Just a guess, but I can't think of any other component of the optical thru data signal path which would be this non-linear.
