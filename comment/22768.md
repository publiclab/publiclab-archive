Yes! Pennsylvania is actually one of the few states that does have ambient air quality standards for hydrogen sulfide! Read more here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-regulations, and scroll down to see Pennsylvania's environmental (ambient air) rules and scroll further down to see PA's occupational exposure rules too.
