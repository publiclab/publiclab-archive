I used this following dcraw command:
dcraw -D -W -4 Image1.ORF

to create this image which has been scaled to 16-bit integers:

That image is what I expect from your camera. The red channel has the highest values for the green vegetation. 

How are you getting the RGB values from the DNG image? I thought the DNG image is a single band with the Bayer pattern (since you followed "Linear (demosaiced)â€™ box is unchecked") so to get RGB your software must be converting the Bayer pattern to three layers and maybe that process is scaling the image somehow? Or, maybe I misunderstand the process. I need to look more closely at Rob Sumner's paper. Hopefully I'll have more time tomorrow. Sorry I'm a bit slow with this. It's been a while since I thought about image calibration.
