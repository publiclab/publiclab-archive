I used this following dcraw command:
dcraw -D -W -4 Image1.ORF

to create this image which has been scaled to 16-bit integers:

That image is what I expect from your camera. The red channel has the highest values for the green vegetation. 

How are you getting the RGB values from the DNG image? I thought the DNG image is a single band with the Bayer pattern (since you followed "Linear (demosaiced)’ box is unchecked") so to get RGB your software must be converting the Bayer pattern to three layers and maybe that process is scaling the image somehow? Or, maybe I misunderstand the process. I need to look more closely at Rob Sumner's paper. Hopefully I'll have more time tomorrow. Sorry I'm a bit slow with this. It's been a while since I thought about image calibration.
