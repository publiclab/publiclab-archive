Each year, roughly 200-2,000 species go extinct due to indigenous species coming and eliminating the population of that environment. Threatened species would likely become extinct if not for human intervention. A species may be considered vulnerable if their population fails to rise or overcome what is threatening them. If a indigenous species is introduced, the entire ecosystem or habitat could be at risk.

The burmese python is a good example of what an indigenous species can do to an environment. They were shipped off from south Asia to Florida to be kept as pets, but soon grew big enough to the point that owners released them into the wild, endangering the wildlife unknowingly. Animals such as the stork, lorgo wood rat, raccoons, and bobcats have become endangered due to the negligence of humans.
