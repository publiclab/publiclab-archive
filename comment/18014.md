Thank you [@JSummers](/profile/JSummers), the microcontroller is linked to my computer via the USB lead on the debug plug. I am having potential reading on my GUI but it is closer to 1.5 V than to the 0.4 V applied. I was using a 1 MOhm resistor so the current might too low to have a correct reading. I will try with a 10 kOhm as soon as i am back to work. I will let you know how I am getting on. Thank you for help.
