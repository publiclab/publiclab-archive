I added some changes to my documentation so as to clarify that I am not actually designing a new Thermal Flashlight build, but rather experimenting with a modification to the existing method outlined at http://publiclab.org/wiki/thermal-camera.  The only drawback I've encountered with the existing method is that the Melexis MLX90614 Infrared sensor is too much of a hassle to get a hold of. 
  I'm attempting to see if similar results can be achieved by  replacing the Melexis component with a much more common, off-the-shelf sensor that can be found in any Radio Shack and modified by soldering new connections to the serial port.
 The hope is that more people will be able to build their own devices if all the components are easy to obtain.  
That said,  the Melexis MLX90614 IR Sensor would be my first choice as it is well documented within the hobbyist/maker community.  Also, the retail thermometers are cheaper because the major retailers can afford to buy in large batches, but if the intent were to "distribute to thousands of New Englanders" then the Melexis would almost certainly be a better choice as the economy of scale would lean more in its favor.
