Hi [@wln215](/profile/wln215)! If you're still looking for more info on the holographic microscope, one of the authors on the paper you referenced, Tom Zimmerman, has a recent build video here: [Microscope Kit V3](https://youtu.be/zqBVLydhUBg). 

And, a [growing github here](https://github.com/CCCofficial/Holography).
