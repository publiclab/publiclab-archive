[@itm2017004](/profile/itm2017004) i just wanted to say that `wkhtmltopdf` seems like a good approach but was wondering if you'd considered rendering a simple HTML template and then relying on the browser to print? This might be more powerful than a built-in HTML renderer, and be less load on the server. But there might be pros and cons! What do you think?
