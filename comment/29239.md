The ferrules and the nut usually feed the gas sampling port of the GC/MS.  Although there are many other instruments that can use them.  Can't help with anything else.  We only ran the gas samples a very few times.  Usually, we did heart cutting of a sample from the HPLC to the GCMS.  We avoided the cost of an LCMS this way when the instruments were much more expensive and unreliable.
