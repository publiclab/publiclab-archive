Great, thanks. I think we could relatively easily find a heavier material to make this work. Would you be able to post the picture of your sleeve plus your suggestion here, where we collect input for the next revision? https://github.com/publiclab/spectrometer3/issues

Thanks for your excellent empirical work and suggestion.
