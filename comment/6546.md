Yes, I ink-jet printed on 'Grafix' transparency film (not the adhesive version)-- it's available on-line via Amazon. It's reasonably stiff in small pieces and you could print many per sheet and keep the cost very low. The filter graphic is at 600ppi and printed with dithering turned on (Canon Pro9000) to keep print dot resolution fine and overall grey shade uniformity. Yes, as the shades get darker (so there is more merging of dots, the dry time increases but for medium attenuation, I let them sit for an hour or so. I did not do cure-time testing so it might be faster than that for what you want to print.
