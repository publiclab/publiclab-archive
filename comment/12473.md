Thank you all for the encouragement!
 This project is indeed very much active!  In fact, I have so much to update that I have to decide how much of the original documentation to keep since it could be useful for others.  As an interim compromise, I've been posting more recent documentation to a blog created for the purpose- http://cribstone.github.io/humblehacker/.  The blog itself is very much a work in progress and will be reorganized into step by step instructions once its fleshed out.  I'll either use this research note as a summary, or to highlight only aspects of the project that are specific to citizen science.  Feel free to take a look and let me know what you think!
