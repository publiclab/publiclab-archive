I am just putting the idea out there. I know that such sources are commonly used in the calibration of photometric instruments because they produce a number of easily reproduced lines across the visible spectrum that can be used for absolute and spectral linearity calibration. They might even be installed in some spectrometers like they are in space instruments for automatic self calibration. If heating the mercury was necessary it could be done externally. If they were to be made by someone who knew what they were doing they could probably be simple glow lamps with electrodes that sputtered.

I'm one of those guys who just enjoys a challenge. I'd much rather figure out a cheap way to do it myself than pay somebody else. I have some soft glass tubing and a 1901 ebook from gutenberg press on making laboratory glassware. I have plenty of RF equipment and a Tesla coil. All I need is a safe way to get the gas out of the cylinders without paying the wine guys $89.
