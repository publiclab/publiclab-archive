 Hi  [@edie_blues](/profile/edie_blues)
I really loved your designs. They are simply awesome.
Just wanna ask you about the header which we currently have vs the left sidebar demonstrated in the mockups have a significant amount of redundancy. We need to reduce it.
[@warren](/profile/warren) some work related to subscription is going in https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/4400.
