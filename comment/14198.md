> Also, ethanol is a non-polar substance, excellent for dissolving hydrocarbons, but ethanol has many polar properties which make it ideal in situations where you may want to dissolve and separate both polar and non-polar compounds, it can do both!

This is such an interesting and great point. I think this could be its own entire research note -- maybe the reference you cited could fit too?

We struggled to find time to test alcohol solvents and we're very surprised to see isopropyl work. This insight of yours explains why!
