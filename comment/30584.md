Farm raised catfish and tilapia can be raised together in captivity. Although for this to work one must be skilled in the art of polyculture fish farming or at least have proper guidance when attempting this method of fish farming. First off, the tilapia must be a bigger size than the catfish. This is so the catfish won't predate on the small growing tilapia. This way both the catfish and tilapia can coexist, and the catfish can serve as organic population regulators. The idea for this method is that Tilapia fish can breed in captivity. The catfish eat the young tilapia fish that are generated in the miniature ecosystem. The number of fish that must be stocked, both for tilapia and catfish, depends on the size of the fishpond that will be utilized for this purpose. In the meanwhile, a larger fishpond will help to prevent overcrowding and other issues that develop in fish farming as a result of insufficient space. The larger pond helps for both the tilapia and catfish to be raised together.
