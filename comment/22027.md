I've successfully used the DFRobot TDS/conductivity sensor combined with the a Mini-Pearl system. The Coqui was much too noisy. My Arduino setup was very similar to the setup suggested  by [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie). I did not seem to have a problem with noisy measurements that were noted by Chris. However, this may have been due to a lower sampling rate over the 3 months that my unit was deployed. My major problem was related to moss and nutrient buildup on the probes; this in turn was likely due to drop in water depth and over exposure to sunlight. My sampling area was hit by a major drought (down to single digit CFS). I am also investigating (or will soon) use of a non-SD card solution. My goal is to have a rec'r in a 'wand' that I can pass over the unit and 'suck' the data off the unit.  I won't be back on either of these until spring due to some continuing, rather serious, health issues, a change management of the watershed of interest, and then the spring thaw here in the Rockies.  I hope to resurrect the [Willow Creek](https://publiclab.org/notes/MadTinker/03-21-2018/willow-creek-water-quality-monitoring-electrical-conductivity-sensor) and will either update or seriously gut the related write-ups.
