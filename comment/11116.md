OK but my intention was not to measure inaccuracy / repeatability in the wavelength measurement, or highlight any errors in the Spectral Workbench calibration procedure. It was rather a fairly quick test to see if I could measure a difference in amplitude between 'dye' and 'no dye'. Since there is a variation between the two test curves in both amplitude and wavelength it makes interpreting the result more difficult than if the variation were in amplitude alone. Unless you just ignore it. In any case, over the visible range, the wavelength error is really quite small. It is under 2%. It just looks obvious when plotted.
In retrospect I could have repeated the test several times. As it happens I didn't, although now you have suggested it, I might. I suppose I could just average 3 plots for 'with dye' and 3 plots 'no dye' and still end up with two curves to compare amplitude.
I think I have documented all the conditions well enough that perhaps someone else can repeat the experiment to see if they can duplicate the results. I'm more than happy for someone to do that.
