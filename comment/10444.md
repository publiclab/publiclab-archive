Hi Laura, not sure if Hydrogen Sulfide is a problem near you, but if so you should look at our H2S monitoring project:

Also are you familiar with SWPA-EHP? They have a great program using Speck monitors to look at PM 2.0 and PM 2.5, as well as using low cost sensors for water contamination.

Additionally, Deb Thomas with ShaleTest (a collaborator on the H2S project) has done extensive air, water and biomonitoring work in Wyoming:

excited to hear about your work!
