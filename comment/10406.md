After add the IRCut filter in the IPCam, with the GIMP ([@Warren](/profile/Warren)) method, I get this:


[![VSTARCAM_T7837WIP_TRIGO.GERANIO.ROSASECA_NDVI_1_.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/990/medium/VSTARCAM_T7837WIP_TRIGO.GERANIO.ROSASECA_NDVI_1_.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/990/original/VSTARCAM_T7837WIP_TRIGO.GERANIO.ROSASECA_NDVI_1_.jpg)


It looks like go better according the color scale (except the pot), the living parts respond to the expected.
Now I will try with ImageJ and the plugin, maybe that way the shadows could be eliminated (the one at the right of the pot).
Thanks for the advise, not only I correct the filter issue, even I clarify the doubts that I had but didn't do explicit.
Greetings.
Ivan.
