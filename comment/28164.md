A combo chemical and phytoremediation example from Mindy who joined the soil research area review kick-off call last week: 

"I saw a talk at a conference where they used a "chelating agent" called EDDS and grew plants to take lead out of the soil. The plant he used was called vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides) and he said you could order it from plant stores. The EDDS "chelating agent" converted bound forms of lead to plant-available forms, and the plants were able to remove enough lead from the soil to make the soils fall below the EPA standards of 400ppm.‚Äù
