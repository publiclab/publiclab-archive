Also just for fun, do you follow the native bee lab of USGS? Sam Droege is one of my mentors, great guy! And I bet he has some lovely photos of the eastern carpenter bee. I am pretty sure they're open access too! Check out more here: https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pwrc/science/native-bee-inventory-and-monitoring-lab?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects
