Ok I have updated the thingiverse [post](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1671298/#files) and I think I've addressed all of the points you brought up, unless I misunderstood them.

[![Modified_Leg_Bracket.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/029/large/Modified_Leg_Bracket.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/029/original/Modified_Leg_Bracket.jpg)
The leg tubes are splayed out at the same angle as before, although it looks like a sharper angle when inside of the structure as they are.

Does the angle for the set screws look like it would be accessible in the configuration you showed?

Also, it looks like the indent for the upper bracket may cut close to the hole in the bracket itself, does the size of that indent need to be reduced?
