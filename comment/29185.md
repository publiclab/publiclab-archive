This is a really clear and helpful explanation, thanks [@nedhorning](/profile/nedhorning). 

And thank you for pointing out the other issue! Does this [other image on the page](https://storage.googleapis.com/publiclab-production/public/system/images/photos/000/025/063/large/5396083368_40528d3da2_o.png) showing the false-color bands represent NRG images accurately? I wonder if the image stating that NIR replaces red was originally in the context of single-camera multispec with a blue filter ([as illustrated here](https://storage.googleapis.com/publiclab-production/public/system/images/photos/000/025/365/large/infragram-types.png)). [@warren](/profile/warren), do you have any background on where [this image](https://storage.googleapis.com/publiclab-production/public/system/images/photos/000/000/278/medium/infrared-combination.png) came from? 

Thanks all!
