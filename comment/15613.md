I think I might have answered my own question (and found a bug? calling [@warren](/profile/warren))

I made this post by clicking the "Ask a question" button, but it is showing up as a note. You can see the section headings are ones that the question submission form fills in.

Also it looks like you can make any note a question by adding a tag following the pattern "question:subject" where "subject" is a tag that already exists. So "question:riffle" for a question about the riffle. I changed my previous note to "question:website" and it's now showing up in the questions section of my profile.
