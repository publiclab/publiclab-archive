I see nobody's responded... I have a camera with GPS built in, and will try to take a photo from a high perspective. But you should also email Pat Coyle in particular -- I know he's taken photos where he's synched GPS, and he could likely help you out. You should be able to find his messages on the mailing lists, or leave a comment on one of his posts: http://publiclab.org/profile/patcoyle
