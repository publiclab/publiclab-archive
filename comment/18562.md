Another point refers to here is the use of cross polarization, I guess that part of the importance of it is that some materials either have or don't have birefringence which is the reason you would see some colors in some of the images (search for quartz as an example). If you want to hear an explanation about this Hebrew here is a short clip I made a few years ago.
