WhenI fanlly get to the "configure" (beta) screen, it displays the yellow line to select the row of pixels.  However, there is no camera image displayed.  This is using Opera.  Using chrome, a box was displayed that said, "plugin not supported".  In opera, there is no box nor outline, and no image. 

Again, this is on a Google Nexus 10 purchased after the 2013 January 1.
