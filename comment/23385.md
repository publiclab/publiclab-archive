  Hi [@IshaGupta18](/profile/IshaGupta18)
Great Work. You had specified each and every point.   
I wanted to ask that In profile section - is that circular tab ?   
I really liked the idea of decreasing the map. I've been empathising about this since week.  
You inspired me XD  
And In dashboard, You tried to resolve the lack of consistency with the card layout which are very much regular ?  
The number of subscriptions stats, You''ll be showing it increasing order ? We can have the famous and more used tags in above I guess.  
And what would be range for subscriptions. We can have diverse variety in amount of subscriptions for tags.  
I liked map taking whole span XD   
And Damnnnn.. We are IIITians .  
Great going. 🎉 🎉  
PS: I would love to have discussion with you again like we had today XD
