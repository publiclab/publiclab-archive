An audio plug like the one you're using could easily make a good standard electrode. I have two suggestions that may help. FIrst, use a gold plated plug. The gold will have far less problem with corrosion (and possibly eletrolytic effects) than the standard quality plugs. Second, for tests, try using distilled or de-ionized water for the low conductivity tests and use contact lens saline solution as the high conductivity media. Saline solution is pretty much standardized and easily available.

I'm not surprised to see the slowly increasing resistance at the start of the video. Current in water is carried by ions: OH or, with salt added, Na and Cl ions. You're right about the medium becoming polarized. The few ions in pure (or even tap) water would be getting pulled to the positive and negative contacts.
