Hi, Dave - thanks for the input, as always. 

As to [#1](/n/1), absolutely, as even a small movement can change the position of a spectrum. Do you feel that the wood-and-velcro stage is not adequate stability? The [glued-wood upgrade](/notes/stoft/03-02-2015/plab-3-spectrometer-upgrade-prototype) you published looks great, but is significantly more complex and expensive, and the plots you publish don't show any wavelength shift within our ability to measure it. In fact, the major improvement came only from increasing the resolution of the webcam:

The stability of the relationship between the camera and slit doesn't seem to be easy to shift enough to cause trouble for our work, although I guess the question is, "how much force should the spectrometer be able to withstand, and what kind?" -- i.e. how much do you have to press it, push it, crush it to cause the wavelength calibration to shift? Given that I recalibrate each time, I haven't had any trouble, but I don't carry the thing in my bike bag or anything.

For [#2](/n/2)-3, you're talking particularly about the slit mounting. Black paper is actually quite rigid, but if there's a good design for a more rigid DVD holder and slit holder, the latter of which connects directly to the wood stage but for which it remains easy to switch slits, we'd love to incorporate it into an upcoming revision. But it has to remain simple to assemble and inexpensive enough to manufacture, or we could alternatively consider offering it as an "upgrade pack".

For [#4](/n/4)-6, I have some thoughts too, but will post in a bit. For [#7](/n/7), do you have suggested alternatives to black paper that would be similarly easy to assemble? Work by [@lukebrown](/profile/lukebrown) has [examined noise inside the device empirically](/notes/lukebrown/07-11-2015/desktop-spectrometry-kit-v3-for-vnir-field-spectroscopy), and it looks pretty good, especially with the sleeve he proposed. 

In general, unless we can empirically demonstrate that there is a measurable gain, I think we're reluctant to adopt more expensive parts and complex assembly procedures.
