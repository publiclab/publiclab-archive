Thank you, Chris! This is extremely helpful, although a bit disappointing that none of the DIY data loggers would work without serious fiddling or losing precision. This little aspect is just one small part of an already logistically elaborate project so I think I'll have to look to other more expensive tools as I don't think I can really dive into the forums and figure this out on my own. 

I'll try to sus out the relationship between the mV and ppb. The manufacturer was not especially helpful on the phone about this. 

Is this sort of an anomaly or is it that diy data loggers work with diy digital-native sensors but not professional sensors as a general pattern?  

Thanks again! I could really have seen me just assume any aurduino datalogger would work to plug and play only to find out it didn't.
