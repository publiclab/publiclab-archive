 Love this interaction design for showing topic communities. 

I also love how a person can add and remove topics, and it's the same mechanism as subscribing. 

I'm wondering for "Widgets" like the map, and also the Events Calendar, and potentially the Blog, or  the Newsletter -- perhaps there might be a page link (like there is to topics --> /tags) where people can add and remove these basic widgets?
