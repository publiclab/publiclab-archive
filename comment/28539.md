>I wanted to know more about the kind of tests you intend to add...functional, unit, system? I like the sandbox idea, will it need additional maintenance after the project is complete?

I intend to make the sandbox as light as possible it will be like a basic test page to see if UI breaks due to changes in Translation helper,js or HTML, I will add unit and functional tests for all new features and based on requirements try to design it in such a way that it requires minimum maintenance.
