Chris,
Very nice device. And smart testing setups. The Explorables visualizations are fantastic. That will change the way people understand data sets. Do you have a target price point for Speck? I saw Illah's Engadget video with $50-$100 for AirBot and WaterBot. It looks like these are not open source. Does the Create Lab hope to partner with someone to manufacture them?  
Excellent stuff.
Chris
