I was just wondering generally how big an area the photo covers, so it's not that important. But one way to do it is to put a known-sized thing in the image -- say, a car whose length can be looked up or measured, or a blanket that's 8 feet square. For this image, I wonder if we can find the spot on Google Maps, and measure the spacing of the grooves in the ground. Did you use MapKnitter to make a map?
