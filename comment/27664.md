you are exactly right
I live on old PC, so latest versions of web browser don't open this page correctly.
So I have opened it on my smartphone in Firefox and it started to work.

I Save as GIF (all steps) and get index.gif file

index.gif file doesn't look to be animated gif to play the whole sequence

How to access full sequence of images processed by Infragram ?

Frankly speaking I would like to buy modified smartphone to feature infragram's video functionality one day.

thank you
