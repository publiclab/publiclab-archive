[@bronwen](/profile/bronwen), [@liz](/profile/liz), am I wrong or this could be considered as "method"? It's own particularities made the KnowFlow a different one than Coqui, Riffle or Mae d'aigua. 
I'm basically thinking about the possibility of using a tag like "activity:knowflow" to facilitate builds and its tracking.
Mmmm water monitoring tools spreading ;)
