Like a great Hollywood franchise I finally released the prequel to that "Configuring I2C Sensors" post from a few months ago:

[Adding Sensors to an Arduino Data Logger](https://edwardmallon.wordpress.com/2017/12/17/adding-sensors-to-an-arduino-data-logger/)

With this new addition, I think we finally have a good "Tutorial set" to help my high-school science teacher friends get into the Arduino game. 

[How to Build an Arduino Data Logger](https://edwardmallon.wordpress.com/how-to-build-an-arduino-data-logger/)

This new 'Adding Sensors' post does not cover the whole range, so there will be an 'Adding Sensors:part 2' when I can find time in the new year.
