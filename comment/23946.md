So from my experience they're used primarily as a sanity check. I'm not sure of the math behind it, and since PA removed the R^2 values that used to be on their old interface, it's hard to say what is "good enough" for how well they correlate. When a sensor is not performing well, the PA map will flag it. I've attached a picture of a flagged vs not flagged sensor (that red "no" indicator I think is what indicates questionable readings or other issues). It looks like the flagged sensor in this case was flagged because there is no second channel data. 

This is nice for the reasons you mentioned. I don't think there is any averaging or algorithm that keeps the values close to each other, or else this sanity check wouldn't work. I've seen values that were wildly different between sensors with no response from one sensor vs the other. 

The plantower 5003s I've used in my custom monitors have gotten very similar values when compared with a PA-II. So while there could be some adjustment, I don't think it's very noticeable. It very well might be a raw factory reading from the 5003. Though this is anecdotal, so we could probably do more testing. 

There are adjustment factors for sensors based on a couple of studies, but I don't think they have to do with the two sensors and are mostly about correction vs. regulatory monitors due to under or over prediction.
