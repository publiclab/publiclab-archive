A lot of people want to go into studying environmental science. Environmental science is a interdisciplinary field of study. Multiple topics are covered but why? It gives humans the information we should know about the environment like how toxins affects our surroundings. People want to prevent things like this happening. Make the world become a better place. The following information goes into detail about the multiple things that can affect the environment and/or how the environment can affect us.  

The current world population is 7,968,545,906. The population is increasing every year, every day, every second. The more people into this world the more possibility it would be taking up a lot of resources. The number of people that access to safe clean drinking water is 779,820,641. People are drinking, smoking cigarettes, having HIV, and this all contributes to health, births, and deaths. The number of deaths this year are 779,820,641 and the number of births this year are 88,388,978. Health can affect deaths and births with defects. If a human smokes or has AIDs or disease, couldn’t it be passed on to the child? Children are at risk of thirdhand smoking with the smoke in the air. 


The numbers are rising and fast. What does health, births, deaths, food, health, and population have to do with environmental science? Well, environmental science is the area surrounding you and how certain factors can change global warming, contamination, etc. The things that are constantly being put in the air by factories or by plants, are toxic chemicals. They can become toxic causing deaths and the people brought into this world is vulnerable to the chemicals as well. The water isn’t clean, resources are running out, as an example, 10,712 people who died of hunger today. People don’t have access to clean water, it’s the toxins that flow into the water are a lot of places. The higher the population, the more chances of someone contributing to these factors that can cause health problems.
