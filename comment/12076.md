I know I'm going to come off cold and inhuman, but we should not ignore mathematics and known trends.

Most natural works, and human works, exist in some kind of network. As a result of the way networks operate, we tend to see Power Law or Parieto Principle all over; it is often summed as the 80-20 rule. 20% of entities in a network contribute to or are responsible for 80% of something in the network, and 80% of entities likewise represent 20% of the measurement. I think we see exactly that pattern with the number of users who contribute great or small quantities of research notes. Using 80-20 language: 20% of the users contribute 80% of the total research notes, and 80% of the users contribute only 20% of the total research notes. I think this is neither bad nor unexpected. If anything, it demonstrates a healthy network, if not a utopian one ;)

Additionally, I think the post count for four active users is very likely to be well modelled by a Poisson distribution. As told by Wikipedia, such a distribution arises from "a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time and/or space if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event".

Clarification of the Poisson process is made by way of example: "For instance, an individual keeping track of the amount of mail they receive each day may notice that they receive an average number of 4 letters per day. If receiving any particular piece of mail doesn't affect the arrival times of future pieces of mail, i.e., if pieces of mail from a wide range of sources arrive independently of one another, then a reasonable assumption is that the number of pieces of mail received per day obeys a Poisson distribution."

So there are two things to ask with that respect:
1) assuming a Poisson distribution of posted research notes, can we decide on average post rate for each user (and is that metric meaningful)?
2) assuming a Poisson distribution is true, why are the note posting times independent from each other? Given the narrative of this research note, one would think notes should be related to each other and thus posting times would be related. Perhaps this is true and the posting distribution is not Poisson. It would be interesting to try to model the post distributions to find out.
