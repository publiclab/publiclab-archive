My first suggestion is to photograph on a cloudy day. Compensating for the sun is difficult. A polarizing filter helps, as does a uv filter, but I don't know if filters fit on the trail camera. And take a lot of photos, because most will be bad.
Best pics to take, for the start, are through clear ice showing the original condition of the wetland. I'd say, take lots of before pictures. Focusing through ice is also a problem.
Here are 2 pictures I took of McKeesey marsh in 2013 to document a sand mine choking it with sand. In the first one, I crawled in a culvert to find clear ice and get out of the sun.
Picture 2 is my bootprint in the swamp. I wish I'd taken more that day, as so many came out badly from glare and focus problems.
