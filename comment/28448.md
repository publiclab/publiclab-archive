Though I am working on improving the proposal from my end, I want a review for the same so that I can refine it wherever possible. Would be very grateful if received reviews from [@warren](/profile/warren), [@cess](/profile/cess), [@ruthnwaiganjo](/profile/ruthnwaiganjo), [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) [@pydevsg](/profile/pydevsg) and all the mentors and community members ðŸ˜„. Thanks :)
