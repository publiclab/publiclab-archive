hey all, 
Great thread. Scott thanks for writing up the materials list. Also, I'll add we had sticky notes and markers on each table with a post-it poster board for people to write the questions and problems, but I think you saw that. 
Also, at the first table, I had a spec kit laid out in order of how you would put it together showing each stage of construction (with the folded part already folded etc.).  That way we could walk through how it's done together so what a spec was, was clear, but people didn't need to construct a full one to see it. We also found that when we set up this way and invited people to "join  in on any part of the project they were most interested in" that people naturally did! Some started with samples, some with analyzing (we had samples ready to go) and a few with construction. Once we had walked through each stage together it was ok for people to jump in in different places. This also allowed us to get through every aspect of the process in detail without spending so much time on the front end (construction). 

I can write a research note on how to host one of these types of workshops if that is helpful (with materials lists and a walk through etc)! Love some feedback if other people try it as well!
