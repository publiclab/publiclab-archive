[@joyofsoy](/profile/joyofsoy) I'm so glad you wrote all the detail of the history since I only got the sum-up from this session. Remember that timeline that was posted on the wall at Barnraising--did you get a pic of that? If so it would be great to add to this posting. I will ask around for it! Also, I will also edit my post about the Barnraising to link to your post, since it really spells out the importance of history and to listening rather than asking. There is a lot we can learn from you about sustainability. I'm going to try to reach out to people in Houston to also write about their community. It's great that we have notes from all the sessions, but I'm finding that what you just posted was even better because more people can now learn from it. Hoping for more like this for the world to see.
