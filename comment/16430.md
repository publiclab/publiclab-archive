Hi there! thanks for your work here. Probably because I don't know much about how programing works, I'm having a hard time understanding what you're asking for input on. Could you phrase your question or what you're looking for input on in a way a non-coder could better understand? If not, no worries but I know [@warren](/profile/warren) is mostly away from internet for the next couple days, so we might need to wait until he has a moment to get back on and catch up. 

Thanks again!
