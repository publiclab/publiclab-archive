Anyone know where the original image set is for the map associated with this note? The map was completed and put in the Archive here: http://publiclab.org/map/coulee-baker-bayou-st-john-new-orleans-louisiana/03-02-2014

There are a couple images i'd like to adjust so that it overlays really well with the other maps of this site.
