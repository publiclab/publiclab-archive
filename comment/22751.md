The answer to the question posed is highly dependent upon the location in question and the type of permitting process, for which one is focusing. Examples follow:
**Gun permit data accessibility in all 50 states** https://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news-media-law/news-media-and-law-winter-2013/chart-gun-permit-data-acces
