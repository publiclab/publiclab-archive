 I think Public lab has a lot of functionality, but not a lot of sense of the "whole"

And I feel like i'm going to lose my thread of thought if i go down one of the many hallways

You can give a sense of the whole with simple text summaries, and counts of the number of posts, etc.  you guys love images, and images are cool (and i use too many), but they need to be smaller because people read things

also, once someone posts a bunch on something, you should gather those links on the right, and prompt them to add to the wiki on that something

also, the less you make the site like twitter, the better.  if it starts to look like twitter, fire someone
