[@peter2975](/profile/peter2975) - I would imagine sheet metal would be exceedingly difficult to work in these dimensions and retain the accuracy required..
Having said that, I am hoping in a couple months to be able to start offering aluminum parts and kits for ramanPi..  The aluminum parts will be cast and machined, then anodized based on the 3d models created for the printed plastic parts..  I may also later be able to offer nylon printed parts..  Check out https://hackaday.io/project/1279-ramanpi-raman-spectrometer for more details...
