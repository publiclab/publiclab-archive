This is great progress. Have you found a place to buy the ZyTemp sensor? I am in Vermont and needed an array of these last night when I froze some pipes. Today I banked the entire house foundation with snow. Really cheap sensors could have saved me some work. Is there the potential to create a device to distribute to the thousands of New Englanders and others who need to understand the thermal properties of their houses better?
