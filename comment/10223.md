Hey!  This looks like a cool project!

Enabling users to embed multimedia on a map was (at one point) part of the spec for my [GSoC project to improve MapKnitter](http://publiclab.org/notes/justinmanley/06-17-2014/mapknitter-annotations-plugin-preliminary-specification).

For the time being, I wonder if the [Google Maps Engine Lite](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/) would satisfy your needs.  There are also some richer tools available for map storytelling, such as [StoryMapJS](http://storymap.knightlab.com/), [slidemapper](https://github.com/cavis/slidemapper), and [SpatioTemporalNarrative](https://github.com/StanfordHCI/SpatioTemporalNarrative).

In the long-term, is this a feature you would like to see built in to MapKnitter?  How would it be helpful to you in MapKnitter?
