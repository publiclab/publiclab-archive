Just a friendly warning for those of you looking to attempt this conversion, I did this last week, it wasn't too hard to smash the ir blocker out but I'm now left with a lens that seems to suffer from focus creep. If I connect the camera to my webcam software and focus it sharply then tighten the set screw, as soon as the lens is put back in the case and the case screws tightened it is rendered out of focus. This leads me to believe that by knocking the ir blocker out something inside the remaining lens elements have been loosened. I have checked the set screw and it remains tight.

Has anybody else experienced this? I now need to buy a new lens and repeat the process but I'm obviously hesitant to do so.

Thanks for your replies!
