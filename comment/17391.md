[@eymund](/profile/eymund) wow I'm late discovering you but I love this Brooklyn Bridge project. In Philly we did a bus trip taking urban youth on a tour of an underground river--showing where it started, went underground, and finally led to the main Delaware River. It was sad to discover how old infrastructure that had capped the river actually caused homes in a neighborhood to collapse. I was able to do a community art project using upcycled jeans to represent the historic river.
