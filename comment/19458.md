Hi, [@MoparWade](/profile/MoparWade), I believe [@amanda](/profile/amanda) followed up on this and sent a cable -- sorry -- this was an oversight. They went out a few days ago -- sorry, we actually had some trouble finding these at a reasonable price! I hope we figure out some better solution -- what a silly part to spend $3.50 each on. Apologies for the slowness!
