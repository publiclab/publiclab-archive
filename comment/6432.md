Hi, Dave - I was thinking that given the propensity to take clipped data in almost all devices out there, what if we printed a whole bunch of these varying-attenuation transparency masks, with, say, two stripes of 50% with an open area between them, and distributed them to folks to see if we can significantly reduce clipping. We can ask people to tag their spectra with "masked" or something, and we can even make the widths of each strip unique integer distances, so the mask pattern can be auto-detected like a simple bar code. 

What do you think?
