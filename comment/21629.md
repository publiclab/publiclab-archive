 [@edie_blues](/profile/edie_blues) - Great work so far.  I like [@warren](/profile/warren)'s idea about the interact zone being a set of buttons or something.  It would be great if the ask a question option worked a little like a google search where it populates possible links from the site as you type.  That could be followed by a prompt to either follow a link or post the question to the community.  (I'm a farmer not a computer programmer, so I don't know how difficult such a thing would be, but I know I'd use it.) I also wish there was a way to easily link posts or notes to research/projects already being done.  I'm working on a sensor project (sporadically), and have several posts with more to come.  It would be nice if there was an easy way to tie these all together.
I like the topics list, and think it would be useful to include a bit more information like last activity on that topic, number of posts on the topic, if I'm already following that topic, maybe a way to create a working group around a topic.  

Just some thoughts.  Keep up the good work Eva.
