My current led and sensor boards are 6 sided and designed to attach to hardware store 3/4 plugs with plenty of epoxy and silicone sealant. Next rev will be bigger and will switch to using your LEDs and photo transistors. I have been using an h-bridge to drive the leds at 5V 100ma but will switch to transistor to keep the space down.

I have a small cap in the op amp feedback to dampen the photo diode response. Any comment?

Is this shape/size of interest to you?
