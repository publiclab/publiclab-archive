We are exploring doing this at Public Lab, in coordination with our Kits Initiative, but many expensive tools or pieces of equipment require even more maintenance and management than DIY counterparts, so we're trying to figure out how we'll be able to host and maintain these things. Some things to think through include:

* who will check in/out these tools
* how we'll learn how to do the above -- maintain, test out before lending again
* how to quantify and cover costs of maintenance and such
* how to provide training, troubleshooting, support for people borrowing them

Did you have a specific piece of equipment in mind? Thanks, Leslie!
