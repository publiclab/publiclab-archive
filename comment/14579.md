[@dhaffnersr](/profile/dhaffnersr) - Great! My question was how you were able to actually get plots of the wavelengths? What software? The reason I'm asking is because I am purchasing the exact same CCD, but my application is laser imaging (e.g. reading the spectrum/wavelengths and plotting them from the CCD camera).  The laser is green. Definitely let me know. highly interested!
