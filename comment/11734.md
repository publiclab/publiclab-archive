[@gbathree](/profile/gbathree), this wasn't as much a critique on the technique, but personal experience has taught me that you have to be really picky on how you allocate time if you do field measurements. It would be really interesting if you could do continuous monitoring throughout the season using the MultispeQ, logging data of say 4 probes on a plant on a regular interval automatically (instead of doing this manually).
