     According to the video on why 99% of ocean plastics pollution is missing, the reason is because the 99 percent of plastics are under the waters surface. The video displayed a “mountain” and labeled all the layers of where these pollutants lie. On the top was garbage patches next was seafloor plastics, then sinking microplastics and lastly plastics on shores. A lot of the trash was dated back to the 1970s which is over 50 years old. The plastics are consumed by living animals and corals which affects them negatively.
