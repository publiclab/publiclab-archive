The Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project (SWP-EHP) is using the Speck to investigate effects of natural gas drilling in PA, they lend Specks out to individual homes for 2-4 weeks to gather data. They also provide free analysis support. The SWP project seems like a great model for others to emulate and as Scott E. indicates, folks in Louisiana could certainly benefit (thanks to Dvera Saxton for info on SWP-EHP).

The specksensor.org site mentions the device is still 'under development' but I've not been able to find info regarding availability, cost, etc. Any idea of this?

This is inspiring work Chris, thanks for posting!
