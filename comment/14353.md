Two thoughts: 

first, the bees sometimes bring in different sorts of pollen, its not 100% sorted although the bees "try to" sort.

second, I'd guess its much more accurate to look at the pollen samples through a microscope (you only need one single pollen) than to get a big enough and sort-clean enough pollen sample for spectroscopy. Otherwise a kind of PCR (ELISA-test) would be much more specific and accurate. Wouldn't it be better to start a pollen microscopic image or a pollen DNA database?
