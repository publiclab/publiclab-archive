Thank you [@liz](/profile/liz) for taking your time to read my work. Industrial expansion and relocation of industries from Kampala to eastern Uganda has worsen water management  in the region, not only through pollution but also encroachment of wetlands. Therefore, rainwater harvesting is a simple and low cost supply technology that has been practiced for thousands of years. Despite rain harvesting being simple and low cost technology, many rural communities and learning institutions in eastern Uganda have not adopted it despite its high potential in contributing to the achievement of sustainable development goals with a view to eradicating poverty and hunger, providing safe drinking water, protecting life on land, climate action and promoting gender equity. This study therefore intends to assess the sustainable water harvesting system in community households and learning institution of eastern Uganda.
