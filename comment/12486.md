+1 "in-between stage" -- it could invite people into the process earlier without needing to yet 100% "nail it" on a final design, and hopefully folks using these prototype parts will help catch problems/improve the design before you go to a surface mount process. However, I don't know enough about the current state to say if you're past that stage or not, but I'm sure you do!
