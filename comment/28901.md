For some communities, human noses are the only continuous air monitoring available. It is a valuable tool and there are ways to use this kind of community survey to get good data, without fancy monitors.

South Coast AQMD inspectors rely on their noses when they make odor calls, as noses are sensitive instruments.

Here is an [odor-logging activity](https://publiclab.org/notes/imvec/02-18-2018/odor-log-1-0) you can complete using only a pen, paper and your nose.
