[@tech4gt](/profile/tech4gt) The best ones are always those which are required in the current scenario.

Image Sequencer needs architectural changes as well as functionality right now. I think it is better to focus on getting users on board â€“ implementing more modules, creating a RESTful API maybe.

I would focus on the modules, features, architecture and then the UI (in order of preference)

But [@warren](/profile/warren) only can say for sure!
