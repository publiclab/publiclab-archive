Thanks, Neil -- this will be a great document to reference, going forward!

The water depth measurement, and use of ruler as a an accessible standard, is really nice illustrative example; and it does seem very important to start thinking about what standards we want to use, and what validation procedures will be appropriate for the device.  

Seems there's some optimization here around making a measurement of sufficient accuracy and precision that it effectively addresses the research question at hand, weighed against the cost (in terms of material, labor, and accessibility) of validation, calibration, and quality of the standard used ...

Would be nice to start to make a list of potential research questions of interest, sketch out a specification for each of them, and then come up with ways of meeting that specification in terms of hardware design, choice of standard, calibration procedure, and field validation of the instrument.
