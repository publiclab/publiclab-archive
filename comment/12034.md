For an S100, the center of the tripod screw hole should be 5.3 cm from the close end of the camera tray (the end that attaches to the servo). That's measured from the outside surface of the end of the tray. The hole center should be 10.5 mm from the inside of the tray lip, and that is the more critical distance. I start with a small hole and slowly make it bigger while checking it's position. I like the back of the camera to be snug against the lip.

The Picavet Kit Guide can help you glue the little rod and the white vinyl cap on the fiberglass shaft, and lace the string: <http://kaptery.com/guides/>

And the guide attached here for the previous beta version will help with the some of the other assembly. I'll get the new instructions to you maybe tonight.
