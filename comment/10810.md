Scott, I forgot about teaching you how to correct distortion in PhotoShop. I'm not sure how to use any of the open-source image editing software.  Next time we map using this camera, we need to then schedule a photo-editing time (we can use the two computers I have at home with Creative Suite). 

Would it be valuable to anyone else to create an RGB camera with a 50mm equivalent lens to reduce distortion?
