Thanks a lot for the detailed review [@warren](/profile/warren)! 🚀
> i think we've discussed this a bit but maybe it's good to note that we can run both the new and old capture interfaces at the same time while improving the new v2 one gradually. This will let us do it in sections, starting with basic integration and gradually adding the extra interactive features, without compromising the existing working v1 system. The new one can live at something like /v2/capture, perhaps, until it's mature! 🐤

Agreed 😄, we can't risk the current version with the v2 as it is nor we can release the new version until it has all the necessary functionality baked in. Sure, we could first test and build upon the new features for v2 at a URL like that.

Will take a look at this for sure and hopefully draw some insights! Thanks.
