A standard coefficient is a tough nut. The amount you would want to shift the NDVI values will differ a lot among photos. Exposure and color balance both influence how an infragram photo will translate into NDVI. It is not just the difference between red and NIR, it is the absolute value of red and NIR, at least as that changes their ratio.

*Infragram NDVI is a function of the difference in brightness between the red and NIR values in a pixel. The bigger the difference, the bigger the NDVI value, all else being constant.*

*NDVI is normalized by relating it to the absolute magnitudes of the red and NIR values, so dim pixels (left) and bright pixels (right) with the same absolute difference between red and NIR will have different NDVI values. This is why exposure is important-- bright photos of healthy leaves can produce very low NDVI values, and dim photos of the same leaves can produce high NDVI values. However, bright and dim leaves in the same scene are often illuminated by light with different color balance (e.g., direct sunlight is reddish) so this relationship is never simple.*   
.  
Because everything that is done at infragram.org is subjective, there could be a slider that shifted the NDVI values into the color range of choice, and another one that spread those values across a wider range of the color scale. The values of those two adjustments could be displayed with every iteration of the result.
