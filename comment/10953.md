Thanks Bryan. You're right that NDVI rose to fame as a satellite and airborne tool, and has only recently been used more widely at close range. It can work well up close, but it's potential might have been overstated in some of our presentations. Distinguishing stressed from healthy plants requires a well tuned Infragram camera and driving it very precisely. It's far from plug and play.  And NDVI might never be as effective as fluorescence at this. The MultispeQ makes a non-fluorescence measurement (SPAD) that is essentially NDVI using light transmitted through the leaf instead of reflected from it. So it will be enlightening to compare that with fluorescence based measurements. And in a development of great symmetry, there are plans to map chlorophyll fluorescence from space using sensors aboard the <a href="https://oco.jpl.nasa.gov/files/publications/1-s2.0-S0034425714000522-main(1).pdf" target="_blank">OCO-2 which were intended to map CO2</a>.(Great early [animations of CO2 generation and dispersal](http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/a-closer-look-at-carbon-dioxide/#.VI-QjjHF98E).) The only way they can see the tiny glow of plant fluorescence from space is to look at the wavelengths of Fraunhofer lines where little sunlight reaches Earth. Are scientists clever or what?

The images in the note that do not have links were scraped from behind pay walls.

I have added a link to the description of measurements which can be made by the MultispeQ. I am still coming up to speed on understanding how these work and what they are good for. This note was intended to organize some information about the background science related to just one type of measurement (fluorescence) made by the device. I am the wrong person to explain much more about this. I don't even know what wavelength the device measures to quantify fluorescence. 

I think I am flattered that my attempt to describe the context of the MultispeQ struck you as an advertisement. No two ways about it, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to hold the power of a Real Scientist in your own hand. Don't delay, become a beta tester today!
