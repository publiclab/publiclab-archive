Hi [@aliciapaz](/profile/aliciapaz) - I wanted to write to say that we really didn't see any shortcomings in your proposal at all, and would have been very happy to work with you. We simply don't have funding or capacity to work with all our picks, and we also can't accept too many people for the same project. Please know that your work and your contributions were really fantastic and we wish you the very best. We hope you'll consider re-applying next round and we would be grateful for another chance to work together. Please reach out if you have any questions.
