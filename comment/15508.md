[@wmacfarl](/profile/wmacfarl), I completely agree with you there. Thanks for highlighting that. 

I also think that we need to provide more feedback options than "success" and "failure." For example, the _activity_ could be successfully replicated in that steps were clearly articulated and followed, but outcomes could be different, and that's not failure -- it's really important new knowledge; it's how we learn about precision, confounding factors, conditional features, etc. Maybe we could distinguish between _activity replication_ and _results congruence_ ?
