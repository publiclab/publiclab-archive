Hi abaker, I'm a bit confused as to what you mean by which to run first, but I'll try and help. First of all, for the TSL1406R CCD wiring, I wired the CCD according to the "serial" configuration on page 8 of that data sheet. In the serial configuration in the data sheet there is an SI1/HOLD1/HOLD2 connection (pin 2, 3 & 9), a CLK1/CLK2 connection (pin 4 & 10), a SO2 connection (pin11), and a AO1/AO2 connection (pin 6 &12), as well as power (pin 13) and ground (pin 1 & 5). The SO2 connection is not necessary.  I connect the power to the 5V pin on the Tiva, gound to ground, SI1/HOLD1/HOLD2 to PD_1 on the Tiva, CLK1/CLK2 to PD_0 on the Tiva, and AO1/AO2 to PD_2 on the Tiva. After that I upload the Energia code to the Tiva. After the Energia code is on the Tiva I use the Processing GUI to collect the data. Let me know if this is confusing...
