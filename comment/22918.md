I tried to apply the same simplistic approach as was in the particle image. Not sure why, but Sobel didn't work, but Canny did. Other than that - this is a more difficult problem, the particles are not as spaced out and are actually touching, some pieces are the same color and brightness as the background, others have a sharp color variation inside of the particulate. I think that we have a large set of images it would be easy enough to start generating image snippets that could then be rated, annotated and labeled by crowdsourcing. But my inexperienced gut feeling is that this would pose a harder problem than the dust particles.
In the image below red rectangles are based on hue (none found - need to figure out why), green rectangles are based on the Saturation channel and blue rectangles are on the value (sorta grayscale).
