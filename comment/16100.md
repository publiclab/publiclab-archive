Hi Mathew, There are three things that come to my mind: 
(1) To think more through Equation 1, I'm curious what P and T are. Pressure and Temp?
(2) Rather than Qact, I actually think it should be Qcalc. Perhaps call the manual to see if there is an error? m and b are determined through a compilation of Qind and Qact, so cannot be equated like this, right? Also, Qact is an independent variable, so it wouldn't make sense as the "y" in "y=mx+b." What do you think? 
(3) Diff = (|Qcalc - Qact|)/Qact
