 Hi, really interested in how you would approach porting OpenCV.js to Image Sequencer.   Since “OpenCV.js leverages emscripten to compile OpenCV functions into asm.js or WebAssembly targets”;  I was wondering if GDAL.js https://www.npmjs.com/package/gdal-js) could also be imported at the same time  (since it seems to also use  emscripten)?  This would help with loading more file formats such as geoTIFFs.

Another great question you discuss is whether Image Sequencer modules  are more easily implemented in OpenCV.js.   (List of opencv.js modules are listed under embindgen: 
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/js/src/embindgen.py#L82-L171)
It may be useful to have a general way to access multiple OpenCV.js functions   and 'read/show' across Image sequencer.
