Hi Chris, 

Thanks for your comments. For me the most dramatic impact of white balance was the realization that there is very little difference in intensity of light received across the R,G,B channels of the NIR cameras that we're using. In theory the white balance should be doing more than simply sliding the histograms. It should be a more detailed adjustment/transformation but I haven't looked into how the camera actually deals with it. Even if the effects appear minimal applying white balance should produce a more accurate representation of the NIR reflectance properties of what we're imaging. 

My claim that there is little difference in intensity in the R,G,B bands of the NIR cameras assumes that the gray target I'm using to set the white balance appears “gray” into the NIR part of the spectrum. In other words I'm assuming that the gray target is wavelength neutral and affects the detection of visible and NIR wavelengths in the same way. Maybe that would be a good test for the PLOTS spectrometer. Grass is not a neutral target in the visible wavelengths but I expect it's reasonably neutral across the NIR wavelengths we're using. 

The effect of using white balance on the NDVI calculation will probably be minimal if the histograms are stretched. In fact, if you stretch the histograms I wouldn't expect much difference between any of the NIR channels when no white balance is applied. 

Until we are working with calibrated cameras we will not be able to produce much better than relative NDVI images. We will be able to see higher and lower NDVI within an image but it will be difficult to compare images acquired using different cameras, filters, white balance, or other settings. That said, I think what we have now is pretty powerful.
