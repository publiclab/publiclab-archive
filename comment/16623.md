Awesome!! Soon we'll update the Leptos station, a spanish cousin of your beautifull MACA ;) Would be great to meet digitally to exchange impressions. Documentation here is outdated. We're working with the Multichannel gas Sensor by Seeedstudio in the place of the MQ2

Reading your documentation right now ;D
