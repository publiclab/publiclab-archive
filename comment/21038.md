Is there anything you could think of along the lines of "join a project near you" where we might direct people to look at https://publiclab.org/people, or another page with a map, where (and we are redesigning those pages too) they might be expected to soon find regionally relevant projects and people to work with? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this even beyond the scope of this page!
