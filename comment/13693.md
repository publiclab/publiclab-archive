Ah, those were the days when the boy might have considered joining me for KAP. Enjoy it while you can.

It sounds like you did some useful experiments with fuzzy tails. Maybe a little keychain camera right on the kite recording video would be a good way to compare kite stability. 

An SD1100 was also my first kite camera. Great choice. 

I think the best lesson is that it doesn't take much wind to fly a kite. You avoided the common mistake of waiting for a windy day to try kite photography.

Can't wait to see your rig flying.
