Also -- just reading this through carefully, and was wondering if the line:

>  I used the pick on the back of the lens

...could be clarified -- you shattered the filter with the pick, right? (this is what I've done, so I'm assuming.) Did you use a small hammer or something to hit the filter? 

Thanks! I love the detailed photos!
