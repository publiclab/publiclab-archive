After, we collected the samples, put them in a bucket, and brought it to the school. To analyze these samples we needed multiple materials. Tweezers, coffee filters, strainers, pans, microscope, lights, and buckets. First we flipped our trawl inside out and let plastics fall on the pan. We took tweezers and picked out each and everyone of the plastics. We utilized the coffee filter as a placement for the plastics. However, we didn't have too many. Maybe one or two, but nothing major showed up in my group's trawls. We also used water to get the remainder of the plastic and rinse the Babylegs. Finally, we analyzed our two specimens under a microscope and took pictures. We only had pieces of cotton filled with plastic and one micro thread.
