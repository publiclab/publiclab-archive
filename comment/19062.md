EDGI has been monitoring federal agency websites for changes or removal of environmental content. There is a little more about that project [here](https://envirodatagov.org/website-monitoring/), including [contact information](https://envirodatagov.org/website-monitoring/monitoring-team/) for the team (you may recognize some names there). [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) , do you have any insight/advice for how someone might set up their own monitoring project? In addition, there is something called VisualPing (which I have not used) and good old Google Alerts (try crafting a search for the appearance of specific word or phrase on the page you're monitoring)... it might not be perfect but is worth experimenting with.
