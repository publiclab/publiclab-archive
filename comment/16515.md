Hi, Sidharth - thanks for your proposal. I'd like to suggest that you consider some of the systems we've already created and planned out, as I think there may be some overlap with the features you describe. I'd like to see a vision for Rich Wikis which incorporates suggestions, comments, and notifications. Partly this is because we already have systems for questions, events, and and research notes. But it's also because I'd like the planning of new features to be in concert with existing understanding of how people use PublicLab.org, and some of the new features we're hoping to add. 

You have a lot of great ideas, so I'd love to try to align a bit better -- thanks so much for posting!
