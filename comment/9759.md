Worked on a one-piece frame today while on a phone call...

Issues: hard to get self-trapping fold over corners working, which would eliminate the need for adhesives. This design needs work but is possible with adhesive strips. This is in the actual box we'll use, although a shorter version -- the final will be 3 inches deep. 

The slanted side for the phone rest is tough to get stable and the laser pointer harness is also hard to make with snap-together parts with no adhesive. I'm mostly using the fold over and tuck technique that our kit boxes already use but maybe I have to learn more cardboard joints!
