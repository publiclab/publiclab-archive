The inverse helps make particles stand out. Another filter you might try is a threshold. If you're using GIMP (free and open source software for image manipulation), here's the menu option for threshold:
http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-tool-threshold.html

In normal color mode, the histogram should show a sharp band on the right, representing the white background. You'll want to leave that marker. On the left side of the histogram, you might see a wider, shorter peak representing the different darkened objects. If you drag the black arrow to the right past that wide peak, everything that is sort of black should become jet black, highlighting it a little better. You can always invert after the threshold to help it stand out.
