Hi, Kelvin - no worries - actually you don't need to be doing any database work yet; we will be integrating your code, or pieces of it, into this page: 

https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/master/app/views/tag/show.html.erb

Each spot that says "render partial" is broken into a sub-template in this folder: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/master/app/views/tag/

But you don't have to worry about that just yet, we really would like to see some more detailed design work on the issues we've discussed above. Can you post your latest static HTML mockup? Thank you!
