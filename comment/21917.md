The tables look great. Before the end of the week I'll try to compare your converted image with on that I run through dcraw to see if they are similar. Unfortunately I don't have Adobe. 

It sounds like an neat project. If you are using the RAW images, and I suggest you do, they the white balance shouldn't be applied. That said, you're white balance setting each day seems sensible. Using the ceramic tiles could be an issue since they look very shiny and likely influenced by specular reflection and therefore very sensitive to geometry relative to the light source and camera. A rougher surface would allow more diffuse reflections. If keep the orientation of the tiles the same for each calibration run that should be ok. It's difficult for me to choose the "best" tiles for calibration without seeing the reflectance data that you'll get from the spectrometer. It would be best if you have high, medium and low reflectance targets for the red and NIR wave bands. Different density gray targets that reflect evenly from red to NIR would be nice but you have to make do with what you have. You'll also have to make sure none of the calibration targets saturate the camera sensor.
