Hi, sorry I missed this one too, but glad it worked! I've usually seen it take about five minutes so I was surprised to hear 30m. But also, we copied a download link at a slightly more convenient place in this comment here:

https://github.com/publiclab/pi-builder/pull/53#issuecomment-439666474

Which is the one we've been using. But we're soon going to publish a new version and we'll try to find a more clear place to put the link. One concern I had was that we need to be sure wherever we're posting it we update each time we make a new version. So I guess we should put the date in the filename or something...
