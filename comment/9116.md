I noticed you're looking at macroinvertebrate monitoring as a part of your approach.  Here are a couple citizen science/school projects doing similar work. [Ecospark Canada](http://ecospark.ca/) has a really nice [guide for Lake Erie.](http://ecospark.ca/sites/default/files/currents/2013_CC_Manual.pdf), also look at [PREEMO](http://www.preemo-msu.org) on the Passaic River in New Jersey, they are also an urban watershed macroinvertebrate program.
