Thanks for all your comment. Some firefighters actually died because they were not sure of the cause of the explosions, I would like to think that if we can integrate all these different data, we can actually save lives.

Thank you Liz on the tip with annotation, and for introducing MapKnitter to me in the first place. I will get back to you with more questions.
