Here are some calculations. Don't know if they will help... 
Btw, I noticed the halogen, and would suggest holding on to it.  At least until other testing is done.  
 These instruments usually "synthesize" a double beam spectrometer by first running a blank of something like water.  This blank is then memorized.  The known is then run and the ratio of ( known/ blank) is calculated across the whole spectrum.  You can then play math games to get absorbance and all the other scales.
A lot of the old blood analyzers would take the absorbance in an interesting area of the spectrum and divide it by the absorbance of an "uninteresting" area of the spectrum.  This uninteresting area was usually 300 to 310 nm, give or take. The interesting area depends on where the sample absorbs light..i.e. run a spectrum, if nothing else.
Good luck
