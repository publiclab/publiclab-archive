A big shout-out to all the GCI participants and mentors for the tremendous work and energy during and after the GCI period. Each of your contributions is valuable for the project development and growth of the Public Lab.  

Whatever be the result of GCI, just by taking part in GCI, you have taken a step in Open Source World üåê and GCI is just one of many events. Open Source world is huge and full of exciting opportunities, so keep learning and exploring.

Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
