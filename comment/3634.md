Again, super write-up. Some thoughts that might be helpful:

* for cfl calibrations without moving the device -- what about putting a small mirror or even white card between the spectrometer, to reflect light from a CFL? That way you don't need to move the kombucha or the light or the spectrometer.
* I think it's a good idea to switch to a linear grating. But you can clean the DVD with isopropyl alcohol to remove the purple dye, and it does help a lot. I've had a lot of success with DVDs in general and actually prefer them.
