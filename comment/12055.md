I might have a temporary workaround  for the control issue...  At least until we can incorporate some kind of autonomous navigation...  According to the instructions, the Glider should pretty much swim in a straight line.  So if we need it to return, in theory it should only require one change of direction...  A very low-tech solution would be to simply attach a long fishing reel to the front of the Glider.  When the Glider is on its initial path, the reel will be set to slack and trail behind it.  Once it reaches the end of the line the slack will tighten and the Glider will change direction.  The line will then be carefully reeled back allowing the Glider to return on its own power.  Alternately the line could be attached to the rear of the Glider but this would mean working against the its own propulsion motion.
  So rather than a "Thermal Fishing Bob" it would be more like a "Thermal Bobbing Fish"!!!  You could even have some fun and pretend like you're fishing for robots!
