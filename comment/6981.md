Okay.  I think the A490 allows custom white balance.  It will make a big difference to follow the [procedure here](http://publiclab.org/wiki/infrablue-white-balance) and make your own custom white balance preset. Then take your Infragrams with that preset selected. That pinky purple infragram will be replaced with orangey yellow ones. Let us know if you get better NDVI results.
