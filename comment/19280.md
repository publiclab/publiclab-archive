As to your other question about professional sensors -- I think there's nothing super special about the sensor you have, and almost any system (arduino/diy or otherwise) would have a pretty easy time reading from it. I think it's a little lower voltage than is usual, and it'd be cool if Arduino's supported that out of the box -- but there's nothing intrinsically incompatible. 

In general, the professional sensors of this sort are probably charging quite a bit more than DIY not because the parts are especially amazing or special (talking about their datalogger here) but because they do such low quantities, and scientists are used to paying this much. Many lab instruments have actually been dramatically improved by attaching Arduinos to them instead of the built-in interface, since many companies don't have as much expertise or resources to build out a custom interface for each device. But there are exceptions where extremely high precision analog/digital converters are useful; still, I'd bet you could achieve similar precision for a fraction of the price with an open source system -- but it's not my area  of expertise!
