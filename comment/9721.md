Yeah, I figured underwater light plays by a whole new set of rules. So much remains to be learned that it could easily get overwhelming.  Underwater photography is probably best viewed as something closer to a microscope than a macro-mapping tool.  So there are going to be a lot of variables.  For example, the addition of artificial light is never considered in aerial photography, for obvious reasons.  But how would it effect imagery underwater?  What about IR LEDs?  Considering our overall project goal is to track invasive Green Crabs, would it be possible to find a way to make light sensitive to the chitin in crab shells?
Or perhaps we could actually develop a seabed mapping tool with an ultrasonic sensor? 
Initially, I figured the underwater pics could be added as a clickable layer on Mapknitter.  Depending on how many images we end up generating however, such data would be really tough to work with without some form of geotagging.  My most recent edits show how I've been trying to incorporate a GPS module into the rig, but I still need to find a way to match the individual photos with the logged geocoordinates.  Luckily, the Adafruit GPS module includes an embedded RTC and its own datalogger.  So the key is going to be setting some kind of reference point between the Mobius timelapse settings and the GPS logger.
