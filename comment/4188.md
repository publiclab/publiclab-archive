Yeah, on the SYBA you have to refocus to ~9" anyways. 

Mathew -- on this one, we could presumably ask for a custom focus too, no? That would be incredible.

The SYBA also provides driverless UVC, but is pretty minimally featured... no ability to shut off gain, exposure. Mathew, would you be able to see if the SANM can have its exposure, etc, disabled with the utility listed at the bottom of this page: http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/spectral-workbench-usage
