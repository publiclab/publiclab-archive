Hi - At this point the plugin does not subtract the NIR from the red. I've been doing this subtraction as part of my calibration tests: http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/06-23-2014/calibrating-raw-images-a-step-toward-jpeg-calibration

At some point I might add that to the plugin. If you have ideas on sensible ways to do that I'd be happy to discuss it.
