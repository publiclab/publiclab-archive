OK - there were several issues here:

* we had an artificial 5-item limit, now removed
* we hadn't ALSO been mixing in tag match results, which would have been a lot for the search phrase `oil-spill`, esp. with the hypen which wouldn't have matched `oil spill` in title or body text, but we've now added in tag matches (that had formerly only been for `/tag/oil-spill` to the results
* we've now added multiple "orderings" --
    * https://publiclab.org/search/oil-spill?order=likes
    * https://publiclab.org/search/oil-spill?order=views
    * https://publiclab.org/search/oil-spill?order=natural (natural language "match")
    * https://publiclab.org/search/oil-spill (reverse chronological of creation date)

Following up with [@bronwen](/profile/bronwen) in this issue on which of the above is the best "default" search ordering: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/2421

Thanks again for reporting!
