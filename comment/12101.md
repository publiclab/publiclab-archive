Hi, just wanted to confirm that you're using multiple thermistors to get multiple depth measurements, and not to speed up your temperature readings -- I just posted a summary of the discussion we'd had [in this comment](/notes/kh_machine/06-12-2015/two-ways-around-a-faster-more-precise-thermister#c12100) and CC'ed in [@kh_machine](/profile/kh_machine), [@neilhendrick](/profile/neilhendrick), [@kgrevera](/profile/kgrevera), and [@lperovich](/profile/lperovich). 

Looks like a great set of tests! One way you might go is to use a Digispark or similar very very tiny arduino, and solder your thermistor and LED directly to the board. Or just use the supplied headers, but they could fall out just like on your breadboard:

The Digispark is Arduino-compatible, but only $9, and about the size of a quarter. One RGB LED and a thermistor would fit in its 5 pins, and you could plug it into a USB battery like this:
