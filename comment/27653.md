Hi. I'm not an expert, but I have some experience. There are many aspects of water quality; turbidity, pH, metals, pesticides, and, what I know most about, bacteriological quality analysis. We probably need to know your motivation; is this river threatened by industrial pollution, or by other kinds of pollution?

I've co-written this "Water Checklist" which was designed for Engineers Without Borders engineers for they kind of work they do in low and middle income countries; it may be relevant to you, though your interest may be different: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rlqD-or39faRLLl7-Zdr2LtbXCHACSLFuBqbDTnP0Yw/edit?usp=sharing
