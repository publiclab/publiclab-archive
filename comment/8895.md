Tom,  
Yes, meaningless was not the best word choice. The real surprise was that the non-plants consistently had NDVI values higher than plants. That's kind of a deal breaker. 
The red channel in that Mobius 2007 infrablue photo is definitely the brightest. That is the channel that should contain the highest proportion of NIR (the 2007 filter blocks most red). And you are correct, many pixels in that particular photo have the value 255 in the red channel. The blue channel is also badly underexposed and has lots of pixels with the value 0. For infrablue photos, NDVI uses red for NIR and blue for VIS, so NDVI computes to 1 for many pixels (255-0)/(255+0). So that's why that photo fails for NDVI.  

I tried lots of other white balance settings and got much better exposures, including one that actually had higher NDVI for plants. So some better NDVI results are probably attainable using that 2007 filter.  

I don't really know if the blue channel in the Mobius is unduly sensitive to NIR. I guess we need some RAW images of LEDs to know for sure.

This photo produces the best NDVI of the 45 Mobius infrablue photos I made that day.

Pro tip: to insert an image into a comment, start to write a new research note, drag an image into it, and copy the code into the comment. Then close the new research note tab.
