What Fiji does is a bit confusing. In a normal histogram the x-axis is brightness so 0 (at the left end) is black and 255 (at the right end) is maximum brightness. When you make an NDVI image with the Photo Monitoring plugin and apply a color look up table (LUT), the NDVI values (-1 to +1) are converted to values between 0 and 255 and then a color is assigned to each of those 256 values. The colors are determined by the LUT. So the histogram shows how many pixels (y-axis) had each of the 256 values (x-axis).
