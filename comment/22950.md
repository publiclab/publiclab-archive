Further to my previous replies, it may be possible to view the sun disk attenuated with the filters used by welders to view their work. I have not as yet tried this idea but do know that these filters are replaceable. Try harrbor freight or some other supply store for these filters. No guarantees that this will work for you, as it would require some form of spectral calibration to see what the response is.

Good luck with your project.
