the "20w50 A" was my first scan. Might have taken me a bit to get these consistent, but I'm not really sure why it was so different. I equalized the area under the graph after I put the sets together. That's how I read the directions anyway. 

Wouldn't you want to use the whole window for the scan? Otherwise you're getting just a clip of it. You could also be getting other samples if someone happened to be changing them out.
