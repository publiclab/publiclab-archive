Hi [@JSummers](/profile/JSummers), you are correct, I am pulsing the pins to these intervals,for the phi M I used other timer to generate the 1.4 Mhz signal (the 350 was meant for the adc), sorry for the comments in the code (many of them are incorrect due several debug sessions), I will update it in a GitHub repository asap. And yes, seems I do not have that problem because I am using the 32 bit Timer, but since I am interested in use the Ethernet capabilities with the 129xl board and I was not able to configure the Timers as I did with the 123 I wanna try your method, one last question, if I am not wrong I think you can increase the minimum time to read the data increasing the clock frequency to 2MHz, for example. And yes, I attach a picture of the signal I took with my code, upper signal is the ccd output with an inversor amplifier and below is the ccd output
