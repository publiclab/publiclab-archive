Hi Warren, thank you, it was silly mistake but this worked! Thank you. I will upload comparison of spectra taken with Kickstarter spectrometer and the custom one. The results are good but the new ones are not as sharp as the previous (<a href="https://spectralworkbench.org/sets/show/91">https://spectralworkbench.org/sets/show/91</a>). Do you think it can be necessary to refocus on different distance (not 9 inches)?
