I am late to the game, but my group is interested in using reflectance spectroscopy to quantify our attempts to remove corrosion from (19th century) Daguerreotypes. Have [@mikeslade](/profile/mikeslade) [@thiagopiwo](/profile/thiagopiwo) 
[@warren](/profile/warren)  [@dmdc](/profile/dmdc) made any progress on devising a useful reflectance spectrometer?
