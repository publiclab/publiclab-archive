Its great that your thumb was greener than expected and that the water roots were forming and growing through carbon deposits. 

Your question about apportionment of air purifying capacity i.e. how much is the bacteria in the roots metabolizing vs how much is the carbon filtering is a great one--especially for the reasons you mentioned: metabolism can increase with time while carbon sequestration will decrease with time. I genuinely have no idea what the answer would be and am pretty excited about what you're cooking up. 

Maybe at some point we should pool our peer review articles and make a phyto-bio remediation library wiki page, so everyone can see what we're reading?

[@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) has done lab work on remediation and might be better able to imagine whether sequestered VOCs in carbon could be degraded by bacteria and help the plant/bacteria symbiosis. 

Also the feeding schedule is a good question. indoor plant water soluble fertilizer manufacturers usually recommend every three months but i do mine about once a year and they are thriving. Maybe the VOCs are helping sate them? :)

I actually hadn't thought about how mixing the growstone and carbon is actually a potentially inefficient and wasteful use of the carbon that sits below the suction hose. Scattering the carbon on top might not be a good use, if as Josh wonders, the vocs could be extracted from the carbon to extend their usefulness. 

I like the max fill hole even if it is messy and sneaks up on ya sometimes. 

this is fantastic work. I'm looking forward to seeing your experimental design! we can set it as an activity for others to try out as well. 

[@warren](/profile/warren) any chance we can develop a replication barnstar? 

for the miniaturization i really hope those 5v fans can pull enough air. I think early models by wolverton used squirrel cage fans because they can move so much air. I have a flow meter somewhere i can mail you if that's helpful
