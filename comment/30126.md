Hi [@muskansingh529020](/profile/muskansingh529020),I really love the  mockups 💯 and how you explain everything with the arrows and text bubbles makes the flow so easy to follow 🎉 🎉, I like the idea of having the "why infragram" and "how to use" sections and having full screen as an option that can be enabled/disabled. I like the icons too and that you included the mobile view too. I really appreciate your attention to detail on the mock-ups they are really lovely. Great proposal  ❤️ ❤️ 

I have one concern on the cyan background on the "Colorise" functionality. It may hinder contrast on the image being analysed as some elements appear with some shades of blue...something to think about and you can look at this after the Outreachy deadline. 
 Thanks for posting
