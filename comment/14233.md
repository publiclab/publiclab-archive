Wow, this is so great to see very close to [@stoft](/profile/stoft)'s post: https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/04-14-2016/spectrometer-stability

Were you able to assess intensity stability over time? See [@stoft](/profile/stoft)'s post for his approach to measuring intensity stability. 

Great post, thanks!
