[@ccpandhare](/profile/ccpandhare) Well, I'm afraid I don't agree with what you say. Based on the description and after I read whole code base, there is a lot of logic and design needs contained on UI part of the whole application. Based on my point of view, this application is a early stage application and still need improvement of building a better structure. I'm saying that I'm gonna rebuild whole web application structure not only the UI part. I think what I can bring useful contribution is what I'm writing above and it does covers requirement of the topic, also shade a light for flexible and manageable for future development. :)
