The only thing I can think off is the magnesium electrode in the middle of most electric water heaters.  It's there to stop the body of the water heater from rusting, decaying, etc. by using electrochemical action. But it only lasts so long.. and then the magnesium is entirely gone.  That's why there is typically a warranty of only two years on most water heaters.  In rural situations(well water), the magnesium can react with other chemicals in the water to produce nice smelling chemicals like hydrogen sulfide.  So occasionally, you will find the magnesium rod  cut out of water heaters.  In a situation like that, it is possible for other chemicals to leach out.  I'd  like to see hard data, first. There are probably more issues with the drinking also.
