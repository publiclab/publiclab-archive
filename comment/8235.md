Nice photo. The NDVI results look quite believable, even for that complicated scene.

In Fiji, when a fresh NDVI image is active, select Process/Math/Subtract. Enter a number which will be subtracted from the digital number (0-255) in every pixel. The colors of the NDVI image will be slid down the gradient in the lookup table (enter negative numbers to slide up). You might be able to make more buildings turn blue, as below where I subtracted 15. 

I think I know which color table you are using, but I suspect nobody else does. It would help to include an image of the gradient with your NDVI results. In Fiji, select File/Open and select a .lut file to see the gradient. An easy way to include the gradient in an NDVI image is to select Image/Color/Show lut. Then position that window over the NDVI image and capture that part of the screen:

To get images into comments, I start a new research note and drag an image into it. Then I copy the code to the comment. Then close the tab with the research note without publishing it.
