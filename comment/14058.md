Hi, ZhanLiangUf - thanks; it's not a requirement, so don't worry about it, but some of the other students have [submitted small bugfixes](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) to confirm that they have working code and are comfortable with our contributor guidelines. 

Re: more than the headers, definitely. I'm just saying I think it'd help to start with those, confirm that the system works in production, then move on to more of the site. One step at a time, you know? Thanks!

Finally, be sure you get your proposal in to Google's site in PDF format, i believe it's due today! Thanks and good luck!
