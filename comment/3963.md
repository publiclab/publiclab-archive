This was direct capture to the Sanm webcam through spectralworkbench.org.  When I get home this evening I'll try a 1400x1600 capture and upload.  I don't think there is an alignment or diffusion issue-- That was the clearest position I could sample from.


before I disassembled the desktop spectrometer to replace it,  I took a spectrum with my Sybacam desktop kit setup in the same place for comparison, much brighter, but also noisier:
