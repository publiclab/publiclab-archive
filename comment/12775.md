Christopher Swain, the first person to swim the entire length of the Gowanus Canal in over a century is also getting similar Canal length sensor fluctuation results in October 2015.

His body suit data is also showing a very slight unusual Ph and Temperature fluctuation at the Bayside Fuel depot area of the Union Street Bridge. Note that the map shows two different swim date readings (April and October), which should not be confused as temperature differences.

We can only continue speculating and researching what may be causing these fluctuations. Besides floatable pollutant or bathymetric causes, this could also be a freshwater seepage point for the long lost Sassian Brook which can be currently heard flowing in the sewers at Wyckoff and Hoyt Street. It may also be Bergen Creek, which frequently floods basements on Sackett Street.

Circa 1770's map of Gowanus Creek and Sassian Brook, from the Fort Green Map, Office of Chief of Engineers, War Department,  US Library of Congress

The Brouwer's Mill Bridge shown on the map is about a 100 feet north of where Union Street Bridge is today.

The temperature fluctuations we are seeing may be surviving fragments of the streams shown on the map.

This data clue justifies further research on Union Bridge area to pinpoint what is causing the data fluctuation. Should an actual fresh water inflow be found, opportunities for diverting those streams out of the City's overloaded combined Bond Street sewer system should be explored.

Some rough field research notes of the area from a 1782 Military Map
