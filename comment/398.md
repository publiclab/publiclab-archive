I found a cheap alcohol sensor. Alcohol is mainly made up of Ethanol and Methanol.

This sensor is very sensitive to alcohol. 

And I think that 11mm Formaldehyde is good as a Formaldehyde sensor. 

We can use MQ-138 as an alcohol sensor. But as your post above, the sensor also may detect Formaldehyde. 

So my suggestion is that we take tests and make codes about that by using three sensors to find a decent result about Formaldehyde.

Arduino can use 6 analogue inputs at the same time :)

At the very beginning, we need the sensors, and then let's go to Home Depot.
