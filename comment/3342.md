No, I didn't take a base line. Last night's measurement was a quick and dirty proof of concept. There are plenty of places this can be improved:
<strong>Web Cam Focus </strong>- How did you determine where to set the focus distance on the orginal spectormeters? I can change the focus by moving the 4" magnifying lens as well.
<strong>Diffraction Grating</strong> - I read the DVD-R+ grating blocks more light than a commerical 1000/in. grating. I've ordered a 6 x 12" sheet to experiment.
<strong>Alignment of Parts</strong> - The lens and spectrometer need to be aligned and focused for each measurement. Firm mounting (hot melt glue, etc) in a solid body (ABS Tube) may be sufficient for alignment, but we need a focus ring (screw on ABS cap?)
<strong>Tipod Mounting</strong> - A solid body needs to be balanced with a mounting nut to be supported by a strong tripod.
