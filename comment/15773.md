I need some help with your questions.  
What is the name of the product you bought from Public Lab?   
Do you want to modify the camera on your DJI Phantom 3?  
Do you want to open up that nice camera and remove the IR cut filter and replace it with a filter from the Infragram filter kit?  
I don't know how hard it is to replace the IR cut filter in that camera. I don't know how good the photos are after the filter has been replaced.   
The formula for NDVI is (NIR-red)/(NIR+red). I don't know how to compute NDVI in Photoscan.
