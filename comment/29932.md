This was our poster and bottle of the project. We aimed at bringing awareness to recycling since the placement of trash is what begins the pollution of the water. It results from humans using land as trashcans and easy ways to dispose of items when trashcans aren't around. Recycling not only gives a place for plastics, rubber, and other items, but  it allows these items to be recreated and used for new products. This conserves resources as well as prevent our rivers from being polluted by microplastics. It starts with the 4 R's. Our bottle has plastic pieces with a message on reusing, recycling, reducing, and rethinking.
