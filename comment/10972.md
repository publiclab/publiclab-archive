That is a good question.

There are many factors that can change how the light interacts with the cmos. No optical system can assure it without some assistance. For a particular setup, the distance between the prism and the cmos detector can change, the prism can be bent differently, the source light might change, ambient light might leak in, and so much more.

There is no guarantee that a spectrometer will assign the correct cmos pixels to the correct wavelength frequencies until the user calibrates the spectrometer using a substance or light source with known wavelength peaks. Calibration should be performed anytime the spectrometer or the environment around the spectrometer changes.

Here are two links to learn more about spectrometer calibration for wavelength.

* Spectromery Google Group search for wavelength calibration: http://publiclab.org/search/wavelength%20calibration
* PublicLab.org search for wavelength calibration: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/plots-spectrometry/wavelength$20calibration

This is still a work in progress. Because there are so many factors which can change, there will always be something to improve.
