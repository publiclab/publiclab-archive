Actually i'm pretty jazzed for the possibility of some of actually doing the lens correction for the Raspberry Pi cameras folks are using, onboard -- like our own firmware! 

Actually, if you have a Mobius with a non-standard lens, that'd also be really interesting to see... or even with the same lens, a confirmation that the settings I arrived at work for you smoothly?
