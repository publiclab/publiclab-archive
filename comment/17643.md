Hi [@iamchriskelly](/profile/iamchriskelly) -- sorry for the delayed reply ... and wow -- this is amazing work you're doing!  Would love to know how your PCB version worked out.

In case it's still relevant:  [here](https://github.com/OpenWaterProject/riffle_328-turbidity) is where we'd gotten to with ambient-light-rejection and the turbidity sensor.  Potentially noteworthy items, there:
- Your previous design is one of our primary references! :)  Thanks for the inspiration.
- We'd taken a very similar approach to the one you take -- based off the same guide by Orozco.  (I'd tried explaining his application note to myself in [this research note](https://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/03-08-2016/removing-ambient-background-light-from-turbidity-measurements-through-signal-modulation)).
- We only used a 'half-wave' rectifier circuit, followed by a low-pass filter -- in contrast with your 'full-wave' rectifier design above. (And I suspect your design might be preferable -- more on that, below.)

From what I can recall, my justification for using a half-wave rectifier  (other than its relative simplicity, compared to the 'full-wave' circuit) was just that it was simpler to build on a protoboard.  And it seemed to me that, in principle, it would be sufficient as a turbidity instrument: although the negative part of the oscillating signal is always 'zeroed out', the positive part of the oscillating signal still makes it through the low-pass filter; one could then just correlate the resultant amplitude output with turbidity levels in the solution under test.

But in practice -- from what I can quickly gather [here](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/an-introduction-to-rectifier-circuits/) -- it might be a better idea to use your full-wave rectifier design -- you're not throwing away half the signal from the system as in the half-rectifier approach, so I think you're going to more sensitive in the low-turbidity regime.  And the full-wave rectifier is just a few diodes more -- no problem at all, especially if you're designing a dedicated PCB for the device.  

> However, we can see some limitations of the system if we then turn on the direct LED again ("d") -- the signal at A1 should drop to 0 (after a few seconds, given the discharge curve of the 10uF capacitor in the low-pass filter). Why does this happen? The direct LED is so bright that it's basically swamping out the signal of the modulated LED, and because there's effectively then no modulated signal leaving the op amp, nothing makes it through the band-pass and rectifier -- which highlights the difference between noise rejection and signal capture.

I also observed this 'swamping' effect -- for example, when attempting to demo the sensor in bright daylight. I guess one could just specify that the circuit needs to be deployed under appropriate conditions -- either in a container that minimizes stray light, or with a light-reducing filter on top of the sensor, or etc.  And I suppose that one could try to catch this condition in the firmware, too -- checking whether the sensor has maxed out, and flagging that in that in the output, somehow. 

Good luck -- would love to hear any updates / results on your design!

Cheers,
D
