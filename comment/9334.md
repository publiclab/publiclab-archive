That is an excellent Mobius photo. The Mobius is so lightweight that there is no reason not to include one on every flight. The lens is very wide, so stitching maps from multiple low altitude photos produces poor results. The zoomed mode of the Mobius just uses the center part of the sensor so the resolution suffers. I don't know whether structure from motion algorithms can deal with very wide angle photos. 

There is a very involved workflow for sfm using free programs. Brenden Duffy made a couple of [tutorials that are linked here](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/07-15-2013/3d-tundra) to my only attempt to do it. Very involved, but effective. 

The [PeKaBe blocks that Brooxes sells](http://www.brooxes.com/newsite/BBKK/BBKK-PARTS.html) are excellent for Picavets, and help a lot with very lightweight rigs. But for normal rigs with the camera mass a few inches below the Picavet cross, and with soft line lacing the Picavet, smooth eyes work fine to keep the rig level. It's hard to justify $60 for four blocks, although they are beautifully engineered.
