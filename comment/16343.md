Hello,
Me again. I found out what the problem was. Yesterday the spectrometer was working in my house. Today I set up the spectrometer in my office and the strip lighting above was adversely affecting it. As soon as I turned the lights off the spectrometer started working. I am now going to make a box to shield the spectrometer from other light sources.
