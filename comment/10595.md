Hey David, yes, you are absolutely right. Ventilation in situations with clean outdoor air is definitely the best short-term option. It is cheap/free and easy. But there are lots of climate reasons why people can't ventilate with a cracked window or open door (like cold winters up north or hot summers down south) and temperature retaining air exchange is pretty pricey. To make matters worse, this paper: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20408902 , if i'm reading it right, states that ventilation as a technique of domestic formaldehyde mitigation looses efficacy over time. So when it appeared that ventilation only worked when there was no outdoor pollution, during certain seasons, and for a short period of time, then I started to think about remediation.

The water capture sounds really interesting! Do you have any links to those testing methods? I think formaldehyde is hydrophilic, but I don't know the rate of dissolving. It would be great to test the efficacy of a DI water bubbler and also figure out how often one would have to change the water for it to work well. That's a great lead!
