Hi, Mridul - it sounds like there are a few distinct features we're hoping to get built. I think one really key one you've been working on a lot could be described as a stand-alone module, perhaps called "blurred-location-form" -- a JavaScript module which is added to (or creates) a Leaflet map and location input just like you've created, and outputs a standardized "blurred" location -- a location rounded to the nearest decimal latitude/longitude.                                               

* based around the Leaflet library
* available on npm 
* uses HTML template like PublicLab.Editor
* we could start with an example repository
* behavior tests with Jasmine
* abstract geolocation -- could be done later, but so you could swap Google geolocation for another system
* default "warning texts" to explain the privacy features

Another sub-project might be a plots2 system for finding vague location of any type: person, wiki, note:

* ability to display in a map a collection of `nodes.each do |node|` on a Leaflet map
* `node.isBlurred` and `node.blurredLocation` -- do we display blurred locations, or just full-resolution locations? Could a blurred location be indicated by a region for some zoom levels, and a marker when you zoom out enough?
* unit test "isBlurred"
* determine how blurred locations are stored, as floats, strings, etc
* test display of location, vague location

This is a start, but could be fleshed out even further. I'd love to see a test-driven approach to these modules. Does this kind of breaking-out into modules make sense to you?
