Hello bsugar,

The DSK 3.0 is made of paper. The paper is, without getting technical, slightly more rigid and slightly thicker than a greeting card. But, that said, it is still paper. If it gets wet it will have ruined the electronic webcam inside. If it gets crushed, the same thing is likely to have happened.

For safe long distance transport, it would be best to disasseble the housing and reconstruct it once you arrive at your destination. The housing is only folded, so it can be disassembled and reassembled a few times. You could keep the bench, which is rigid, and holds a wood block with webcam and cable velcro-ed to a wooden platform, in a plastic bag inside of a box to keep it safe (box) and waterproof (bag).

Moving it across the desk is fine.

We would love to see builds that use rigid containment, and if a build using rigid containment gets developed at a reasonable price point and to a mature enough level to warrant testing I would be happy (as the Public Lab Kits Dept Coordinator) to do what I can to facilitate a beta test of it.
