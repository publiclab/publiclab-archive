My favorite memory so far is the kinds of sustained, difficult and trans disciplinary conversations that I've been privy to in my short time working with Public Lab. Over the course of almost all of 2014 Jeff, Shannon, an epidemiologist named Nicole Novak and I were hashing out how Public Lab could build a web platform that could collect very sensitive environmental health data in a way that was highly secure, epidemiologically robust and also facilitated community participation, community analysis of data and community organizing. Trying to reconcile open participation and self-determination of research with the methods of robust data collection was difficult but also extremely exciting to figure out inventive ways to both collect data on science's terms and connect exposed people in human ways. That thoughtful and sustained give and take is the kind of creative and politically relevant work that Public Lab uniquely makes possible.   That public lab can do that hard hitting work without forgetting how to have fun and the non-quantifiable joys of grappling with the air, water and land are part of what makes PL so special.
