Oh, that plotter looks great! Thanks for sharing! 

So, there are a lot of people out there teaching each other to make great visualizations in the [p5js community](http://p5js.org), who are interested in using live sensor data, but hadn't been able to without some relatively brittle interfaces like a serial-javascript browser extension. So this'll be a nice way to engage a whole lot of expertise on data visualization from that community. They seem excited about it and are suggesting this be included as one of the standard "example sketches" for p5js, which'll be great.
