Hi Anita! Thanks so much for this post. The work sounds fascinating.  Are you figuring out how to use map mill and knitter okay for making the maps? Let us know if you need any help with that.  Also should we set up a place page for your project? So you can keep all your notes in one place? We can set you up with that quickly if you want!
