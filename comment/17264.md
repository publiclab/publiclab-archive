Wow, this looks exciting. A quick interjection here - one of the most challenging aspects of organizing groups of people gathering environmental data is that they may be required to respond on a moment's notice and how the communication is set up is critical. During the design phase of a data project, it seems there is more emphasis on the protocol/collection of the data, and not so much the people part. 

Including resources to help new/novice organizers how to set up this part of the problem would be useful, too. (Maybe first responders have a pattern-language ready solution that could be adapted)?
