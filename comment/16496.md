Hi, [@mridulnagpal](/profile/mridulnagpal) -- great work, let me think of some things that'd help start getting this together:

* If you make a branch called `gh-pages`, you can try it out online in GitHub, kind of like how we've done here: https://publiclab.github.io/inline-markdown-editor/examples/
* I think a good README would be great, similarly to the other example modules, that shows exactly how to instantiate your code
* The example HTML file could include comments showing the `<!-- START OF EXAMPLE -->` and the end -- so people know what's strictly necessary. 


I think a name might do well to include `leaflet` -- what do you think about `leaflet-blurred-location`? 

How are you thinking of doing Jasmine testing? I often start just with an empty test suite that asserts `true` just to see that it properly runs. And then I put the documentation on how to run tests in the README. You can just copy a lot of the README from the other example modules I've linked to as you begin to add those functions.  

This is looking great -- once we iterate a bit, we can make it under the Public Lab account, and have that be the "main" repository. Thanks for your hard work on this!
