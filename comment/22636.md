> In case you have not heard back, check EarthWorks website for application for community group to request FLIR Gas Finder camera + operator.  

From Earthworks' site: https://www.earthworksaction.org/library/detail/flir_gasfinder_320_infrared_camera#.WcvseUuGMxx

(though I didn't find the link for the application form)

> Earthworks has invested over $100,000 in a FLIR GF320 with a telephoto lens in order to document the pollution that may be linked to health and environmental impacts reported by communities, and to ensure that officials and regulators know when oil and gas facilities cause pollution. FLIR video makes visible air quality problems that warrant air monitoring, operational changes, new emission control technologies, and regulatory action.
