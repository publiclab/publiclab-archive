Nice post. It would be neat to characterize some of these cameras. I made a half-hearted attempt a while back to access the necessary equipment but it didn't pan out. Maybe I'll try again. From the little work I did using LEDs it seemed clear that they don't offer the precision necessary to provide the detail required to do much more than get a general sense of how the sensor is dealing with different wavelengths of light and also to better understand some of the white balance effects. 

There is a "debayer image" plugin available for ImageJ/Fiji. I don't know how that compares with RawDigger but that's what I've been using for the LED analysis. 

I don't quite follow your logic when you write "in spite of the fact that the measured red intensity is larger than the green intensities". From the histogram above that statement it looks like the green band has a much higher intensity (DN) than red or blue. Am I missing something?

I look forward to hearing more as you progress with your experiments.
