Hi nnole! If you are using the spectralworkbench when you are prompt to authorize the use of the camera (using chrome at least) you should be able to choose between the cameras connected via usb and the laptop's camera.</br> 
So go to htp://spectralworkbench.org, click on capture image, and chrome will ask you to authorize the use of the camera. In the dialog box  you can choose between your two cameras ;)
