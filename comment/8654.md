Pat, I've used Hangups a lot and they are probably the best solution. Brooxes KAP-klips are also proven effective, and may be easier to use. They are a modified version of long-line hooks which commercial fisherman use to attach countless baited hooks to a single long fishing line. The standard long-line hook is five inches long, but I found some three inch ones which should be perfect. They don't cost any less than Brooxes KAP-klips ($2 per pair) so KAP-klips may be the way to go. I also ordered some keychain carabiners to subject to my stress test. I also got a spring balance so I will know how much pull I am subjecting them to. Can't wait.
