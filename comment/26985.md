You could probably use HD parts.  It just depends on what you are sampling (corrosivity) and the threshold levels of your analysis.  Ideally all "wetted" parts (anything that touches the sample) are stainless or teflon.  However, brass or plain steel is going to work fine short term but can corrode long term and cause cross contamination.  

Generally you wouldn't expect ambient air to corrode steel or brass but there certainly are places on earth that will happen due to local pollution.
