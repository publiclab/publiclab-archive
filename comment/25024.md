1. The changes of photosynthesis and physiological indexes of plants can reflect the pollution of the atmospheric environment, such as the determination of plant photosynthesis to produce oxygen capacity and content of chlorophyll.
2. Leaf is the main organ to absorb atmospheric pollutants. The determination of leaf content of pollutants can explain the contamination in the area . I guess this can be done with help of Public Lab's Spectroscopy Project.
3. Measuring SO2, NO2 and Ozone with sensors in the crop area.
