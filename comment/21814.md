I also vibe with the graphic calendar in rectangular form -- that was a request we heard from people during the user interface interviews about https://publiclab.org/events -- that the "agenda view" should be changed to the "calendar view". It would be great if someone clicked "Edit" on the /Events wiki page and just changed it now.
