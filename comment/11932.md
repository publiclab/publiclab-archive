I was thinking about this more on my ride home last night. Although you might not be able to say what the particulates are with an inexpensive optical sensor, with two inexpensive sensors placed down wind and up wind of an emission source you could say somewhat convincingly that particles of a specific size came from a specific place, which could be a potent claim to make. 

answering your other question: here is a cheap one you can buy https://www.specksensor.com/ I'm not endorsing it, or saying its better than the dustduino, its just one that I know about if you are looking for plug and play.
