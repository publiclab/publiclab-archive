This is a great trick. I have made a bunch of these. If you are doing this with a cheap USB cable, you might want to check the red and black wires before you do all the soldering. I have bought a lot of USB cables on eBay and many of them do not use the red and black wires for power. Two of the wires supply power, but it's often a random pair.

On the other hand, a very large proportion of the USB cables I buy on eBay have only two wires. These are manufactured as charging cables and supply power but cannot transfer data. Of course all of the product descriptions on eBay say they are data cables. So I keep buying more in hopes that I will get data cables so I now have dozens of these charging cables. Let me know if anybody needs some.
