This is a great recap, thanks! Looking forward to hearing next from the artist named "So" who adopted the plant to live in Guangzhou. One additional pregame point i can share is that [@shanlter](/profile/shanlter) and I found a plant to buy at a shop a block away that already had roots growing in water in a clear jar. It was like getting a jump start on the build!
