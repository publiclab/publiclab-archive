One other test to characterize the stability of your spectrometer is to just repeat identical measurements after a certain time span, say minutes, or even hours. Have you tried to repeat the measurement just of one sample with a couple of minutes or hours in between, in order to test the reproducibility of your spectrometer? do you get the same spectrum? If for example the LED fixture warms up over the time of minutes, the absolute brightness may vary, and peaks might shift...
