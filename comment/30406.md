Clean Air Act was in 1963 

Clean water act was in 1972 

The clean water act of 1972 was basically a law in the U.S. This act was basically made for water pollution by the government. This act is so effective to so many others b/c due to when people without access to clean water resort to drinking from contaminated water. Someone, well anyone could easily contract diseases. & To say that camp Legeune, the people there were exposed to so many different types of chemicals; this would be one of the main causes for why the act was enacted.
