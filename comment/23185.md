This may be a little specific to the Pittsburgh area, but the Create Lab at CMU has made a smell reporting app to track industrial odors from pollution sources in the area. The app is called [Smell Pittsburgh](http://smellpgh.org/how_it_works) and might work as a model or starting point for other communities. You may be able to get in touch with the developers or someone who knows more [here](http://www.cmucreatelab.org/projects/Smell_Pittsburgh).
