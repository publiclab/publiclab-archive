Warren, I really appreciate your offer to provide a replacement lens!  If you do have a spare, my address is:  5655 Kenny St.  Lake Oswego OR (USA) 97035.  If you want me to pay shipping, just let me know how to do that.

Bronwen, I did find a couple of Pi cameras here: 
 https://store.publiclab.org/collections/diy-infrared-photography.  Are they what you are referring to?

Thanks,
Mark
