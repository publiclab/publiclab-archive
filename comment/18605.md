See

The lambda max of the spectrum (i.e. maximum wavelength) in nm is plugged into the equation 1,897,000/peak max of spectrum (nm) = Kelvin degrees.
So as the maximum wavelength goes from red to blue the temperature of a star at least increases as expected because the blue end is higher in energy (frequency).  A place to start?
