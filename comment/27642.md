Hi [@tawah_peggy](/profile/tawah_peggy)! Thanks for your proposal! A couple suggestions - first, it's good to note that first-timers-only issues do take a lot of time to support people on, so perhaps it's good to moderate the quantity of them you create in your first week or two - it could end up taking most of your time! Also, it's easier to review FTOs when tests exist, so you don't have to try out the changes manually. But i love that you've built in newcomer welcoming into the earliest stages of your plan - great!!

Second, i would guess you'll run into some of the image upload issues when you begin writing tests. So there may be some overlap between the system test week and the image upload week - ideally, the process of writing thorough system tests will help you expose the bugs in upload, and by solving the bugs, you'll complete and pass the tests. This is like test-driven-development, kind of -- writing tests first - except that the bugs are already in our live app (whoops! üòù ). 

Anyways thank you for a great proposal, we really appreciate it!
