Cool, Matej! Do you have comparison sets of the pure unfrozen/undiluted samples alongside the frozen versions, and also alongside samples in mineral oil? I'm also curious about your statement that mineral oil will change the spectrum, can you cite your reference? Was it [@ethanbass](/profile/ethanbass)'s work? Just interested in interlinking all this great research. Thanks!

Also, when do you plan to try collecting a sheen from the surface of a body of water in the field? Just curious, thanks!
