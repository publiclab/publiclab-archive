Hi Jeff, Above I expressed my ideas and findings about these gems. I'm completely ok to work using both ransack or sanspot gem. Since you have the overall idea about the plots2 project, I would like to have your preference from the suggestions. It will be more helpful for me for my final GSoC proposal. Thanks !
