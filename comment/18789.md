Yeah, that is part of the question.  

The medical devices had direct access to the blood stream and lungs.  So particle number and size was critical.  It was usually measured with a laser beam.  The particle would partially block the laser beam, and you could determine the size by the amount of light that got through.  The down side.  You could only do one particle at a time.  You either had to dilute or go to other methods to get more answers.

This method is commonly used in HEPA filters in the medical industry.  So now there are hepa filters being used for particulate removal.  I'm trying to get the two fields to sync together.  That's where my problem is.

Any help is appreciated.  Thank you.
