Hi [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996)  !

You have provided amazing **corner-cases** in the comments above !

I agree that Twitter does not provide the **email** , hence we cannot make the sign-up using twitter . 

But we can make for FB and github , right ? I think in the mock - up above , we may give option to link only twitter account because of this constraint of email by twitter . 

We can make sign - up through **FB** , by fetching the email after authentication and searching our User database : 

   *  if that email exists we say that **"you are already part of community => please sign-in"** . 

   *  else we add the email-id to the User Model . But what about the **password** and **username** in User model , right ? How about we **send an email** to this new user with **temporary unique username and a temporary password** . In this way he/she will always be able to **sign-in** through FB  but can do normal sign-in only when the user enter the temporary username and password or sets the PL password via the link in the email .   
 
Does this makes sense ? I hope this helps . What do you think ? 

Thanks !
