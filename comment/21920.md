I realised that my tiles may be too shiny and grabbed some matt paint samples (pieces of matt paper) from a local store. They’re small and light, meaning I could easily have them in each photo. Still, they’re far from perfect when it comes to reflectance - strongly influenced by geometry. I’ll certainly look for better (rougher) targets - would you recommend having them in each picture or is it enough for calibration purposes to take a shot of them every 50 „tree” pictures or so?
