I read that. I tried anyway just to check if there was anything perhaps a small difference. And so far I noticed a completely different problem.

I was as it turns out not thinking this through. By placing a different colored in front of the card the spectrum changes but it's more like cutting the spectrum in halve.

Originally I wanted to see if I could find a match when different colored cards were measured under different kind of lightsource. But theorie already provided the answer for that. Which is the same as you just described. The color interpretation is based on brightness, hue and the color of the surrounding within the field of vision. I hoped to see the effect of the surrounding in the spectrum.

Originally, I had a serious sign in problem. I couldn't save the captures in the normal way and tried to collect data in a way that I could copy it into a spreadsheet.
