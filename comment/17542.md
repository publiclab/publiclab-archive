Hi, Chris -- great post as usual! 

I do have to ask about your comment regarding chemtrails -- I strongly suspect you put that there to see if anyone reads your post :-P So do I get a prize? Or are you fishing for someone else? 

When I used to do commercial design work I used to put a clause on p7 of my contracts that the client would have to buy us a goat under certain unlikely circumstances. The only client ever to find that was happy to sign it.
