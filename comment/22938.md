I'm no expert on microscopy.  Did mess with it a little.  The difference I notice is a lot of the work is done with crossed polars- messing with the polarized light filters. 

They also do some determinations of refractive index.

I applaud the work you are doing on microscopes.  They can be quite expensive.  Please keep up the good work.  

You might look up the particle atlas in a college library.  If it looks worthwhile, let me  know.  They are gathering dust here.  I would donate them.
