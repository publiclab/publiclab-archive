The hearing is about the military troops and their families consuming toxics chemicals. 

1 million marines were effected by the chemicals. 

The chemicals that affected the water was fuel. 

779,897,260 doesn’t have access to a safe drinking water source. 

Carcinogenic are chemicals that can caused cancers. 

The officials knew about the chemicals that was in the water and didn’t say anything. 

 

The military officials that oversaw making sure the water was clean enough to be drinking by the troops and their families failed at their jobs. The also broke that law by completely disregarding the clear water act that was brought about in 1972. The clear water act was made so that this wouldn't happen to people but since this act was broke on purpose there is now a class action lawsuit against Camp Lejeune. The chemicals that were found in the water was fuel. 1 million troops were effected and that is not counting the people that were in their family.
