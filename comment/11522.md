I just used a StellarNet spectrometer to find the transmittance of hot filters from the Canon A2200 & A2500. Both hot filters rapidly fall off before 700nm. The Wratten 89B only seemed to transmit above 700nm so the two together don't transmit any light. The Rosco 2007 with the hot filter only transmits blue light. Any ideas on a camera model with a hot filter that transmits up to 730nm, as Chris suggested? Has anyone had success creating a red-edge bandpass?
