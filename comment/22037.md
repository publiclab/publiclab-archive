I did a little browsing and so far tthe Ormantine link [@warren](/profile/warren) shared is the only US supplier that comes up quickly (will keep looking), and I haven't found any indication of these tubes being DIY'd (yet), but am poking around still. 

I did find a comment on a Q/A thread that suggested that something called an  [Ogawa badge ](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Can_you_help_me_understand_why_Palmes_Diffusion_Tubes_are_not_widely_used_in_USA?isAnswerFieldFocused=true) may be more commonly available in the US, looking at the links below to see if I can learn a little more: https://ogawausa.com/passive-sampler/
