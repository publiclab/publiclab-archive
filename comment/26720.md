I like the section on UI! Thank you! 

I wonder if a second version of the mockup would be useful to represent a 'minimum viable product' -- the initial version you'd aim for versus one representing ALL the changes you'd like to make. 

I also would like to suggest you use the Bootstrap v4 library as much as possible to ensure consistency with the rest of the site, as well as maintainability and compatibility. You can check out docs on it at http://getbootstrap.com/, but also maybe one of these editors (for some quick prototyping):

* https://pingendo.com/
* this one is not free... but looks nice! https://bootstrapstudio.io/
