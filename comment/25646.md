It very much does reburning,  It reaches tempatures that can not be reached by many form of fuel,  it can reach in what in cermics is called cone 12, or 2,400F  
It is also quite long and reburns all the gases, it is said that what comes our it co2 and everything else in the smoke is bound in the clay.
