At this time I will just say that it is an material that is reoccurring in my immediate environment (an community apartment building) and I do believe it is an hazard to my health. It may have also been an contributing factor to the recent passing of an elderly neighbor of mine. I am already aware of and have a good sized list of labs that does this type of test, the only obstacle I have in getting this done is cost. As for the bags you referred to they are called evidence bags that features an tamper evident seal that show stop signs when there may have been tampering with the sample also with their own unique serial number and if used right can be powerful evidence in proving your case in court.
