Microplastics are small plastic pieces less than five millimeters long which can be harmful to our ocean and aquatic life. Plastic debris can come in all shapes and sizes, but those that are less than five millimeters in length are called microplastics. Microplastics cause damage to human cells in the laboratory at the levels known to be eaten by people via their food, a study has found. They found specific types of harm – cell death, allergic response, and damage to cell walls – were caused by the levels of microplastics that people ingest.
