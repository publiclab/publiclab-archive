I believe this is a bug; the JavaScript console shows:

```
application-0add8749179623a04221903b025c601c.js:57 parsing calibrate:92343#25653
application-0add8749179623a04221903b025c601c.js:58 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'wavelength' of undefined(â€¦)
```

I was able to reproduce it and will look into it in the [source code](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js) -- sorry!
