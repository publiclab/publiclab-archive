Thank you for your response! You're right in that I need to refine the logistics and parameters. There's no real budget, but because I'm a student who's not even located in Georgia at the moment, suffice to say this project would have to be frugal. Pointing me to people who have already collected data is very helpful. The timeframe is pretty crunched as well: my class ends in December, but even outside of it, this is a cause I'm very passionate about and will work on outside of the class.

At the moment it seems to be lawyers and people in the community collecting data, because a pain point of these communities is that they feel the EPA and EPD are being too sluggish about this issue. This is not to say that the government is unaware of the problem: Brian Kemp, governor of Georgia, and the city of Covington have appealed to BD Bard to close while they sort out their emissions, but BD Bard's response has been, " . . . Nah."

BD Bard just released self-reported data: https://www.ajc.com/news/covington-seeks-sterilization-plant-closure-over-toxic-gas-emissions/nmQpNnCz8znvnJQNIDnQ6I/amp.html?fbclid=IwAR3h5S5VLyyOoKFrVhuromS5zfirjOx_I7QuxC-m9SkNqv_Uh-TlkS5pAu8
The community is doubtful of that, for good reason. They really want independent scientists to test their air. Another avenue I want to explore is appealing to the CDC and public health organizations to start an inquiry into if this could be considered a cancer cluster. If the EPA and EPD are acting unsatisfactorily, maybe public health government organizations will take notice?
