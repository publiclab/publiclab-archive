Hi, Mathew - just posted an update on the stepped slit tests here: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-25-2013/stepped-slit-tests

BTW, your links to Dave and I should be to /profile/foo, not /users/foo -- just a side note.

The slits are amazing... so precise! And the smartphone cameras are so much better than the ones we're usually using... quite remarkable.
