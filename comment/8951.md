For reference, I have experience with Hach HHPC6 units (taking them apart, cleaning them, diagnosing their measurement capability, etc). I think your initial design is very similar to what I've seen inside the HHPC6.

There is a huge difference between clean room measurements and outdoor particle sensing. Huuuuuuge. HHPC6 was meant for clean room measurements, but I have fielded them in places they should never go. Filters need to be cleaned daily to weekly (depending), calibrations need to be taken almost as often, and so on.

Don't even get me started on pollen season in New England. Those pine trees could kill every particle sensor I ever fielded.
