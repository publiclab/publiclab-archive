Yes, i agree there is some infrared data showing in the trees, and I do think it's possible to get useful info out. Just be aware that the dynamic range of the data after post-processing may be quite low compared to a pre-calibrated image. And that it may be worth it to try checking against an image from another camera with better conversion just to give you confidence about what you're seeing with the GoPro. 

Good luck!
