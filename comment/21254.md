Hi [@icarito](/profile/icarito)! In that setup we're using this solar panel to lipo pcb, and from that to the Witty Pi energy manager → https://www.seeedstudio.com/LiPo-Rider-Pro-p-992.html

For your intentions i'd give a try to this marvelous piece of hardware by UUgear (same as Witty Pi) → http://www.uugear.com/product/zero2go-omini-wide-input-range-multi-channel-power-supply-for-raspberry-pi

You can use from a power bank to a car battery to power up the device ;D In a near future our camera will use this one.
