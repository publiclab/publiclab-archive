[@warren](/profile/warren) - I don't think using a 395 nm LED or an even shorter wavelength is really going to solve the problem of the overlap between the light scattered from your LED and the light emitted from your sample. If you take a look at the literature, there have been several studies comparing the effects of excitation wavelength on the fluorescent emissions profiles from various types of oil. The findings are that the emission profile always shifts to the left, so that the leading edge of the spectrum lines up with the peak from your laser.

You may be right that using a shorter excitation wavelength would superficially solve the problem of overlap, insofar as the sensors in the webcam would no longer be able to detect the region of overlap, but I don't see how this would actually solve anything. There would still be an overlapping region, even if you are unable to detect it. On the other hand, it also isn't clear to me that the small area of overlap introduced by the 405 nm LED is really all that bad. Maybe we can just crop out the area of overlap and still have enough data left over to make our determinations.

[@stoft](/profile/stoft) - I'm looking at your final figure there, and to my eye, the shapes of the two spectra don't look all that different. Clearly, the fluorescence induced by the laser is more intense, but the broadness of the peak and its position on the spectrum look much the same to me.
