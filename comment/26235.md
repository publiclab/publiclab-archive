I tried one of those little six dollar laser rangefinders (vl53lox) for measuring distance to snow. Those rangefinders don't work at all in sunlight because the laser is too weak and the sensor is saturated with NIR light from the sun.  It works fine at night. I tried it on two different snow surfaces: an old packed surface and freshly fallen snow. Both gave reliable results although possibly more noisy than a solid surface. So I now have a snow gauge in the backyard sending the results to my phone via Blynk.
