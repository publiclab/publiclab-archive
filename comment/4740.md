I'm sorry for the eviction of Craft Market.

The project itself is amazing, and your imagery is crystal clear and astonishing! I liked the layering graphical explanation a lot.
It's also very encouraging to see that the people there chose the use of maps and documenting this area as part of their struggle.

Kudos for that!
