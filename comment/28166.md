Thanks for finding and sharing this critical safety info [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n). 

Adding a little more background here for anyone interested: 
Stereoisomers are different forms of a chemical compound that share the exact same chemical makeup, but differ in how their atoms are oriented in space. They will have the same chemical formula, so the (S,S) designation before the formula is key.

The other stereoisomers break down more slowly and could end up staying in the environment for a long time, similar to EDTA.
