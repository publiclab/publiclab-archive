Working my way through the paper.  One of the things the original talks about is " Extraction by immersion in DMSO"  and "OD435/OD415 nm". This is equivalent to  absorbance at these two wavelengths.  The paper references "Pigment Extraction from lichens with DMSO and estimation of chlorophyll degradation" by   R.Ronen, Margalith Galun ,Environmental and Experimental Botany, Volume 24, Issue 3, August 1984, Pages 239-245. I got the summary.  Unfortunately, it doesn't give extraction conditions. Any help is appreciated.
