A wet chemical test like "heavy metals".  This initially was done with hydrogen sulfide, so all the different kinds of metal salts were metal sulfides.  Heavy metal sulfides ( such as lead sulfide) are dark colored and show up easily in solution. There are variations on the test that don't use hydrogen sulfide, but they usually are still sulfur based and stinky.
