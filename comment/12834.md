I was worried about those o-rings... the silicone, while durable, is flexible and doesn't stick down well. 

 Next option is to try poking through a sheet of rubber on both sides as you suggested. I'm thinking a bike inner tube (also because I want to try putting two screws and a presta valve through the cap)

Would they be easier if the screws were longer?  They are so cheap we can easily include a screwdriver in the kit.
