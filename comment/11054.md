Hi, thanks..!  If you're building according to the current design without any mods, it'll probably cost you around that..  Depending on where you source everything and how much your filament costs, etc..  I am gearing up to make kits too, no word on prices just yet...but I'm trying to make this as convenient for people as I can..!  Kits will include a new version of the boards, optics, a choice between plastic and aluminum parts for the optical paths, and a few other enhancements.. 
I'd love to hear feedback from anyone, or suggestions as well!
