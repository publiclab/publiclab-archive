[@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) mentioned the segment on soil sampling in the Oil Testing Booklet we did: https://publiclab.org/wiki/diy-oil-testing-questions#Collect+a+sample+for+laboratory+analysis

And that Jordan Macha will know more about this, but was looking for a digital resource on this kind of glass-bottle sampling. Perhaps the above guide could be reformatted and cleaned up for this purpose? 

Jordan is with Bayou City Waterkeeper (used to be Galveston Baykeeper) https://www.facebook.com/bayoucitywaterkeeper/

**Update:** I copied this into an activity draft that we can refine: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-07-2017/collect-a-sample-for-laboratory-analysis -- not sure how this compares to EPA methods and happy to update or point along to a more complete protocol.
