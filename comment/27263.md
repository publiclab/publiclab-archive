hello! as noted in the post "The community scientists will be using both they Public Lab DIY formaldehyde test kit and the RKI FP-30 formaldehyde meter" but the PL formaldehyde kit crowd funding project got pulled so it never got funding to be fully built out so just the RKI is what was used. its a color changing tab read via photoelectric photometry technology.
