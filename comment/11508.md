Hallo John.
Based on wikipedia you need 531 and 570 nm filters.
I checked arround and I could not find those filters. I saw 540nm and 580nm 
http://www.edmundoptics.com/optics/optical-filters/bandpass-filters/visible-bandpass-interference-filters/3429/
I suggest you google arrond for band filters and see what you can get.
What kind of cameras you want to use? If you want to use two consumer cameras look arround on this site for ndvi setup. Or check my profile I used two canon cameras.
If you need anymore info let me know.
