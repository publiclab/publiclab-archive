This question has come up before, at EcoHack 2012, when [@kosamari](/profile/kosamari) DIY manufactured cotton candy using a sodacan, power drill, a box of sugar, and a campstove https://publiclab.org/notes/kosamari/11-14-2012/diy-cotton-candy-maker-0 as a prototype for a sterile sugar matrix that could go up on the balloon and collect aerial microbes. At the time, bioinformatics PhD Andrew Hill of CartoDB was working with Jonathan Eisen regarding atmospheric microbial censuses: https://phylogenomics.wordpress.com/

The outstanding question seemed to be, if i recall, how to keep the matrix sterile until it was at altitude. I'd be happy to facilitate any connections that might be helpful, let me know.
