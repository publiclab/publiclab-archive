I wanted to say thanks to [@stoft](/profile/stoft) for so thoughtfully responding to each of these questions. I've found it hard to keep up with the rate of publication here, but I agree that it'd be helpful to see the LED setup so we can try to determine why you're not seeing fluorescence (or perhaps why you're not seeing *enough* fluorescence).
