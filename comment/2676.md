Hi Chris,

In your opinion, what single item improves most the results of the spectrometer? Better camera? The grating? The spectrometer case? In other words, if I want to be able to mimic as much as possible the results off the $4,200 unit, which single improvement will get me closer to its results? Is there anything else that can be added to the DIY unit to make it better?

Thanks for your posts, I've been fiddling myself with my own unit I built a month ago and been having fun since!
