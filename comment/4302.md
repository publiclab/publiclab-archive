For the spectra we looked at the height of the green peak around 550 nm of a sample of some deionized water for a baseline and then compared the peak height values from the graphs of the solutions to the peak height of the water. We did not think to try looking at more than one peak so that would be something to look at and compare.

Yes this is a project for the Instrumental class at Centre College.
