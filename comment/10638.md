I bought a scanner earlier that claimed 9200 DPI, but I could only get at best 1700DPI out of it. it seems the best effective resolution of a slide scanner is currently 3300DPI:

That said, there's no reason one couldn't build a gigantic microscope that uses a scanner to read the enlargement. it would be quite a bit of work though:
