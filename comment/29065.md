According to [this article, Analysis and modeling of vadose zone gas transport : modeling methane emissions from landfills](http://commons.lib.niu.edu/handle/10843/14659), their Landfill Methane Emissions model found that the "primary variable affecting shallow vadose zone gas transport are air temperature fluctuations." California Air Research Board, in [this webinar] (https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/CARB/bulletins/2b953ef) found that soil cover characteristics had the greatest impact on emissions of methane, nitrous oxide, and NMVOCs. This [study](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2136/vzj2018.02.0033#bib63) on gas releases from oil and gas wells indicates that atmospheric pressure and groundwater flow also affect the transport and release of subsurface gases.

Transport also depends on gas production rate, compaction level, soil cover gas permeability, and soil-air content.

Hopefully this helps--if you need any more specifics, I can help identify some experts who can weigh in.
