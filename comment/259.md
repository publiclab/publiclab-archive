A note on this -- Remote Sensing: Principles and Interpretation lists the cutoff of UV for glass (lenses) as 350nm. I wonder if getting a Hoya 350 instead of our 340 would let a *lot* more light in. Actually, looking at this graph, i think probably not -- there's still more sensitivity at 350nm using a Hoya 340 than there is using a Hoya 350. 

The only advantage really is that there is a *tiny* amount of IR leakage in the Hoya 340 which is even less in the Hoya 350.
