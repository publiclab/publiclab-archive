We're developing a new system based on Infragram, which is more systematic, and can output things like averages, etc. We're testing this out now and it's a prototype, but you should be able to use this to calculate NDVI from an image, then average the result:

If you want to crop a specific region first, you can use:

However there is a bug in the crop module that may cause you some trouble -- we're working on it but it's dicey at the moment.
