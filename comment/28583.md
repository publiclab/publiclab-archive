I'm in New Orleans and deal with many issues from subsidence causing potholes and un-leveling homes. This blog has a really good summary of the issue: https://livingwithwater.com/blog/urban_water_plan/problems/subsidence/ 

One of the biggest problems we have is that our grey infrastructure (the sewer system, canals, and other ways that we manage water in the city) don't allow rainwater to penetrate the soil and refill groundwater reservoirs. This causes subsidence and can also lead to sinkholes.

Here's a fun article on "Sinkhole de Mayo" a few years ago. https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/festivals/article_f3c467e8-5127-5ef9-ba38-3c71277fed9f.html
