Ranon,

This is really excellent stuff.

That's a great idea to use exploded diagrams for assembly instructions. The Saturn V Rig has a few places that could benefit from this. One is the attachment of the camera tray on either side. So if all the detail could be included in this type of view it would improve the user experience substantially.

*Lots more detail would have to be added (washers, bolts, nuts).*

*Here is what I use now for the Saturn V Rig on the simple side of the camera tray.*

Here is what I use now for the Redstone Rig:

*The Redstone Rig is the same on both sides of the camera tray, but the Saturn V Rig is not.*

Another detail of the Saturn V Rig that could help is the Picavet shaft, Picavet cross, big gear, set screws, spacer, nylon washer, and locking cotter pin.

*This does not show enough detail of all the parts along the Picavet shaft.*

I have been trying to illustrate assembly guides with grayscale images instead of color. Exploded diagrams could help a lot.

Great progress,  
Chris
