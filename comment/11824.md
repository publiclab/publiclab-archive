HI Ned,
I find your notes quite informative. The photo monitoring plugin is a great tool you developed. 
You also mentioned in your note about the R script to do image digital number conversion. Actually I'm curious to try that out on my raw images but the download link seems dead. I was wondering if there is any working link available ? 
Thanks,
Dj
