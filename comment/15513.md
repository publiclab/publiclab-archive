Related to the use of photography as evidence, i'm passing on a great / relevant article pointed out to me by [@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) called "Proof Reading: Tracing the history of evidential photography" http://www.bjp-online.com/2016/09/proof-reading-tracing-the-history-of-evidential-photography/  

~"... images made to illustrate a fact -- the identity of a face, the location of a cell, the shape of a skull as confirmation of evolution, the coaxial lighting down a gun to show the twist of the barrel â€“ all required to prove a point, solve a mystery or simply to inform with clarity."
