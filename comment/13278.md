Yeah, Ann put the fire of deadline to me. 

well, no. i've never had a test done to determine this question of crude vs refined. i just thought that it is, possibly, a binary that the OTK could discriminate between, and that kind of info is a bit useful. there's some literature on mass spec / different components in crude vs refined, so that i'm sure a test could be developed by looking for those components.  perhaps it's already in my reference post.
