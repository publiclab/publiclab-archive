This summary is really helpful, especially coming from so many people. A few things:

Privilege Walk - Maybe make this an individual exercise where everyone receives a piece of paper with a horizontal line with check boxes. After each question is verbally asked, a box is checked if applicable. That way things stay anonymous, yet still powerful. You quickly know where you stand and can imagine where others might be on that line.

More Voices - yup, more work to be done on getting people of color from communities that are affected by disasters. From the other two Barnraisings I've attended, I felt this one was great at getting people who have experienced things first-hand from around the world. One to-do for all of us could be to make sure we extend a personal invitation to people next time to be sure we get everyone's voice. There's a big difference between forwarding an invite compared to calling someone up on the phone and asking them to join. :) Many people that attended this time were new to Public Lab, so it is up to us to help everyone connect. It also will take more funding for Public Lab as many people can't afford to travel and need child care.

Follow-ups- Some of our discussions were abstract, as pointed out, but I feel like the follow-up plan of connecting, doing drills and collaborating during emergencies was the best I've seen based on Barnraisings I've attended. I think a lot of this had to do with the pre-planning with Willow, Liz, Tammy (and anyone else I missed here!). So sick of feeling helpless during disasters and this time I feel like I have a world-wide network.

Lenape Dedication - It was so great to start the Barnraising this way. Another great lesson in keeping the local history present in all we do.

Finally, I'm also still processing the stories, which keep pointing to the idea of living sustainability. How can we connect in our communities so that when disaster strikes we know who our leaders/influencers are, where are resources reside and how we can quickly engage people for sharing/distribution/rebuilding. Looking forward to being part of this new larger community and so thankful for the time we've already spent together. More to come.
