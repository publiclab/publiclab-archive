Omniauth structure. 

Older structure => It creates new user when a person registers (using traditional methods) and the authentication model has no role to play in it. When the user signs up from social netwroking websites, it goes to authentication model which confirms and then communicates with the user model. So there are two models in which one of them is completely unnecessary. 

Structure that I propose =>   As you may have guessed, the username and password also goes to the same authentication model and so does the authentication token from the social networking websites. It makes the traditional username and password act as a provider just like facebook-omniauth and twitter-omniauth. 

This approach is used by omniauth-identity gem which has been explained Ryan Bates on this video here, http://railscasts.com/episodes/304-omniauth-identity

From the end-user point of view there is no difference at all. It is completely the same experience.
