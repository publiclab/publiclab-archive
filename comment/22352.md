Depending on your goal, a spectrometer might not be needed to locate dandelion flowers. They are dramatically distinct from green leaves in the visible spectrum, so a consumer camera might be all you need. It should be straightforward for an image analysis routine to determine which part of the image below is dandelion flower.

A digital camera is a blunt spectrometer with three color channels, so using just one channel could make the routine even simpler. Below is the red channel of the photo above.

The red channel might also allow you to distinguish dandelion flowers from fruits.

To do the best job of distinguishing yellow flowers from other things (like white flowers), all three channels can be used to identify yellow. Any webcam or Raspberry Pi camera could be used for the sensor.

If the task your robot will do is to spray glyphosate on each plant, please reconsider.
