Ah, thanks for the answers! Makes it much clearer now....

As i told before, i want to have the possibility to tae normal Pics and pure NIR....

I haven't recieve my cam, guess it will take some days or even weeks, so i can only guess what is doable and whats not. 

My ideas for a system, where i can switch between "normal mode" and "NIR mode"  would be following:

Remove the IR block filter, and build the cam together again. Then make 2 Filter discs (1 IR Block and 1 visible light block), wich i can attach in front of my lens as needed.  I thought about a magnetic system for the two filter discs (like the fish eye lenses for mobile phones, im sure you know them.)


The other idea would be to change the original lens every time with an modded CCTV lens (IR sensitive and VIS blocking), but i dont know how easy and fast this is done and if its that good for the whole cam.... thinking about dirt and dust wich can get inside...

Is the lens changed easy? 



So what do you think about it?

thx a lot!
