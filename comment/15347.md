Hey jeff, I was thinking form looking at the picture were you are soaking up the oil slick from the water's surface, did you know that using super absorbing Tampons (feminine napkins,) absorb at 25 percent more efficiently than the pig matting?

I would try making a rig where a series of Tampons are staggered out on a long pole, kinda like a fishing lure with a weight at the end, then you could just tredge the area in half the time. Then I would take the Tampons and transfer them to general purpose glass test tubes, a much more efficient way for preserving and collecting evidence, don't you think?
