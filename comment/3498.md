Tom, images would be very helpful (so my mind doesn't explode). If you upload images to a site like Flickr or Picasa you can grab the HTML embedding code there and paste it into these comments or use the image tag ("Enable rich-text" first) to link to those sites. Or start a new research note which allows a gallery of images from your hard drive. Or make a post at the Google group which allows inserting photos from your hard drive.
