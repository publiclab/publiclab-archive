Thanks wjw.
I hope they are more clear in the labelled pics attached here.

Wow, that's an elaborated response. How could I know these parameters (power required, I-V ). Source of that rotation is a drive shown in the image. Seems like solenoid to me. DC I guess (extremely sorry for these half-witted replies, I seriously have no clue of it). Detector is enclosed in a aluminium chamber. I'll take it apart in some time. 

I am eyeing on the development of similar sized spectrometer using 3D printing from scratch, using CCD as detector. But i guess I could make a very good use of the tiny mirrors and most important- the mounts!
