Hi, Henry - what is your fluophore? 

Did you purchase the alpha oil testing kit with the blue/uv laser pen? 

I've been able to line up the desktop spectrometer and get a decent reading -- can you upload an image of your setup so we can see how you're scanning? And how bright the fluorescence is? You can just click "Edit" for this post and drag an image into the "main image" field to the right, or actually just into the text area for the post itself. Multiple photos would be really helpful too!
