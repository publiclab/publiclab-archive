The control vehicle pollution for human health: 
Clean vehicle and fuel technologies provide us with a reasonable , available means of reducing transportation-related pollution and global climate change emissions. These include fuel-efficient vehicles that use less oil; cleaner fuels that produce fewer emissions; and electric cars and trucks which will entirely remove tailpipe emissions. https://cementconcrete.org/transportation/modes-of-transportation-difference-between-railway-transport-and-road-transport/1246/

Strong federal and state policies also help. Vehicle emission standards have helped cut pollution from cars and trucks by about 90 percent since 1998, with further improvements coming from the Tier 3 standards. https://cementconcrete.org/building-construction/building-survey/2598/
 Future emissions reductions from trucks and other freight sources are essential for meeting air quality standards and protecting the health of these who live and work on the brink of ports, rail yards, and freight corridors.
