  I believe that Britney made a smart choice to put her air quality egg in the kitchen because in the kitchen theirs a lot of particles in the air because people are always cooking. Also she put the air quality egg in her room and that also was a smart choice because their may be different humidity etc in her room then in the kitchen.
