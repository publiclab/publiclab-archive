     Human population is the amount of people that live in an environment. The current world population is estimated 7,968,540,666. The worldâ€™s population is growing at an alarming rate creating worries of overpopulation. If a place is overpopulated, the ratio of resources needed to support the amount of people can decrease.  

     However, there have been approximately 37,102,650 deaths this year. Deaths can be related to problems within the environment. For example, water and food are resources people need to survive. But, without enough in the environment, the population can decrease. Humans will continue to deplete or contaminate these resources and will lead to a future where once abundant resources are limited. 

     779,820,985 people do not have access to water. About 863,056,511 people are undernourished. Lack or contamination of these in the ecosystem can harm the environment. People without health care also contribute to deaths and population decrease. All of these factors contribute to environmental science and impact our lives directly.
