Hey Jeff, I'll start posting more references, sorry, ok, the reason for this particular regent (solvent combination,) is to separate the aromatic hydrocarbons from the oil sample, if you don't do this, the data will be completely convoluted together and hard to discern upon processing.

The reason for the baking soda (which I use lab grade quality,) is for this type of data collection on this sample I was looking for the benzene rings and naphthol's. Which I should have pointed out out were at 422nm ( 2-naphthol) and 481nm ( naphthacene- 1-naphthol.) Also, ethanol is a non-polar substance, excellent for dissolving hydrocarbons, but ethanol has many polar properties which make it ideal in situations where you may want to dissolve and separate both polar and non-polar compounds, it can do both!

Reference's for compound identification solvents used and emission wavelength data can be found in Lange's hand book of chemistry sixteenth edition Section 3-Spectroscopy, Table 3.32 

Point number 2 for diluting a sample, is to eliminate the "inner filter effect" caused by the fluoresced intensity to be re-absorbed back into the cuvette, not good. I know chemisrty pretty good, so it helps, since really that's what spectroscopy is, fingerprinting molecules.

Yes, I can post pic's of what the oil separation looks like, no problem!
