Further empirical evidence suggests that the VBAT pin delivers the voltage of the battery that is plugged into the "Lithium 3.7V" connector, but not the "General 3.5-6V" connector. So the VBAT pin does not supply 5 volts when a 5 volt battery is plugged into the proper connector. I assume that means that additional electronics are generally required to use sensors which require 5V. 

However, there might be a simpler workaround for some sensors. I have used the Modern Device wind sensor Rev P with a 5V Arduino Nano. The wind sensor requires 8V which the Nano does not supply. So I powered the Nano with a 9V battery and powered the wind sensor from the "VIN" pin which is where the battery connects to the Nano. Everything else was wired normally. It has worked well on several flights (https://publiclab.org/tag/series:diy-wind-sensors). 

I don't know whether the Riffle could tolerate the logic signals sent back from a sensor that is powered with 5V. It probably depends on the sensor, some of which might use 3.3V logic.
