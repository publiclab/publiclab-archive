Hi [@smmontgom](/profile/smmontgom) , I enjoyed reading your poster on your previous sampling protocol. Thank you for sharing! I am a big fan of publishing data in this way, and creating a public map about public water fountains sidesteps the privacy issues faced when trying to share environmental health data collected in people's homes.

Could you please share more information about the sampling method you currently use? 

* What actual kit do you send out? 
* What lab processes it? 

It's good practice to share these details transparently without requiring someone to sign up as a beta tester.
