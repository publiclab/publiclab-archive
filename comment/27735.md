[@jjcreedon](/profile/jjcreedon) - definitely flagging this for [@mimiss](/profile/mimiss) [@bhamster](/profile/bhamster) as we continue to grow documentation about air quality monitoring on the website and for the Store. Also tagging [@A_SCH](/profile/A_SCH) [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1) as well as they're continuously growing this information on the Public Lab website! Thank you for speaking up about the costs of the sampling.
