This is especially cool as it uses a Raspberry Pi camera, which it seems can be set for fixed exposure and uncompressed image capture. I'm going to install [SpectralWorkbench.js](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js) which now has a script for commandline image to CSV processing: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/blob/master/examples/node-example-import.js
