Hi there, [@MaggPi](/profile/MaggPi). First of all, THANK YOU so much for your interest here!

Okay so to the point now, I've actually been working on a image sequencer integration a while back but after a recent update, my puppeteer instance won't start for a second time. So the "require" integrations currently are unstable, and I'm looking into those as we speak. However, if you choose to use it as a general CDN by including the min file like inside the head tag of the index.html file it should work just fine. After that you can refer the docs or open an issue to clear out any doubts/issues that you maybe facing.

Docs: https://github.com/publiclab/matcher-core/blob/main/README.md

Puppeteer issue: https://github.com/publiclab/matcher-core/issues/9

Puppeteer repo mirror: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/4776

Once this gets resolved, the library should work fine for server side as well. I'd love to get some help here, if you're familiar with puppeteer or just have any ideas as to why this could be happening!

Thanks!
