Okay, I think I understand now. What you did is:

1. remove IR block filter from a camera
2. take a photo
3. take the same photo with exposed and developed color print film in front of the lens
4. align the two photos and make NDVI

If that is what you did, there is one problem. For NDVI you want two photos (or channels in a photo): one with only visible light and one with only near infrared light. Your photo with the film filter is a good near infrared photo (the film blocks most visible light), but the photo with no filter has visible and NIR light mixed in all three channels. So you would need two cameras: one unmodified so it takes normal visible light photos, and one with the IR block filter replaced with film (or Wratten 87).  Or you would need another filter, just like the one you removed from inside the camera, to put in front of the lens so normal photos could be taken again. Then to make traditional NDVI, the red channel in the normal photo is used for visible light and any of the three channels in the IR photo is used for NIR. 

The white balance setting on the NIR camera does not matter much. If you do a custom white balance while filling the frame with a gray surface, all three channels will be the same and the photo will be grayscale. Without the white balance the photo will look pink, but that is just because the red channel is a little brighter than the others. Any of the three channels can be used for NIR. White balance is more important when the filter used is intended to make a photo with visible light in one channel and NIR light in another. For example a Wratten 25A filter allows capture of NIR in the blue channel and mostly red light in the red channel.

An easier way to make NDVI from two photos is to use [Fiji (ImageJ) with the Photo Monitoring plugin](http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/06-24-2014/updated-photo-monitoring-plugin-to-compare-ndvi-with-dvi) written by Ned Horning. The two photos are automatically aligned and a new image is created with NDVI computed for each pixel.
