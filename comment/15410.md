Would superglue be acceptable? 

The justification of superglue is outlined below:

-It dries quickly

-It comes already in small containers

-It is extremely cheap

-When purchased in bulk, it does not come in one massive container (which woodworking glue appears to), but instead comes in many small containers

Let me know if you think that it might be a viable option
