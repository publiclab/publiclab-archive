Hi sorry about my english I from Uruguay and just bought a phantom 3 pro with NIR camera conversion. I've the same confusion about the channels of my NIR camera is capturing. The people who sold me told me that the modification was remove NIR filter and configured the software to not broke the hardware, that correct?. I want this to generate NDVI in diferents crop and then analize them.

That is a image captured by my drone.
I did a color histogram in fiji and the results were:

The sellers tell me that there are lot of lut filter who do NDVI with the images captured like this, but I was reading a lot of tutorials on forums and couldn`t know who lut is better for diferents things. 
ND in red channels seems too near to 255, and that thinks it`s wrong. 
I was worked with GIS programs to separte bands, but i don`t know wich band is NIR, Red, Green or blue.
Thanks for help
