----
Assuming your blue filter is transparent to NIR (near infrared) wavelengths, any red in the image is depicting NIR reflection. The blue filter will transmit visible
wavelengths but only in the blue portion of the spectrum (green and red are absorbed by the filter). So your image should be depicting NIR as recorded by the red pixels

and Blue as recorded by the blue pixels. Green objects (not vegetation) should be quite dark. These are the transmitted/absorbed&nbsp;wavelengths before NDVI modifications are made.

Hope that helps.
