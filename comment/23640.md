 Hi [@wu_ming2](/profile/wu_ming2) - sorry we weren't able to connect you with some resources on this. [This comment](https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/01-04-2018/how-good-is-the-purpleair-sensor-and-what-does-it-detect#c22821) from [@BrandonFeenstra](/profile/BrandonFeenstra) may have some useful information:

> If you would like to learn more about Air Quality Sensors and their performance against regulatory instrumentation, I would recommend a visit to the South Coast Air Quality Management Districts's (SCAQMD) Air Quality Sensor Performance Evaluation Center (AQ-SPEC) web page. The purple air sensor has been evaluated in both the field and the laboratory. Program's website: http://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec PA-II field report: http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/aq-spec/field-evaluations/purple-air-pa-ii---field-evaluation.pdf?sfvrsn=4 PA-II laboratory report: http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/aq-spec/laboratory-evaluations/purple-air-pa-ii---lab-evaluation.pdf?sfvrsn=4
