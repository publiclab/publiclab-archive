Some anecdotal evidence.. I've built my own PM2.5 monitor using the PMS5003, and have found it to be very resistant to influences of high humidity, as long as no fog is involved. In foggy conditions, the readings do sometimes get skewed considerably to the high side. PurpleAir uses it, and here is a current map of raw PM2.5 readings from a bunch of PMS5003's on a rainy day, where humidity is >70%
