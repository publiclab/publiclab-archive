This is the IR filter, it is just slightly broken.

I would remove the rest of the filter with caution if necessary and then mount the lens back into the webcam and checked with some webcam program (for example Cheese for linux) if the image is not distorted. I hope everything is going to be alright.

Have a nice spectral weekend :D
