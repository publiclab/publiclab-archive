What about a thermochromic temperature strip adhered to the card? https://www.google.com/search?tbm=shop&q=thermochromic+thermometer&gws_rd=ssl or isn't that good enough resolution?

Nick, I heard you found the therm. and humidity meters were too big? Are they not the same as shown in the initial photo?
