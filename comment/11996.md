Jack, Thanks for explaining the details of the design. Sorry for the delayed response, the notification email from your response got stuck in my spam folder. You're correct about the details of EIS. From what I have seen, implementations of AC experiments like EIS on microcontroller-based platforms are few and far between because of the added complexity. I think DC experiments would provide a great starting point for what I'm trying to measure and I will certainly take a look at what can be done in regards to signal generation from the PULSE pin. Do you have a recent version of the Eagle files for the WheeStat 5.4 or is the WheeStat 5.1 board files in GitHub the most recent iteration (other than r8 and r9 being 10k and the 4.7uF capacitor in the RC filter)? I appreciate the help.
