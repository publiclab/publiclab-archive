I wonder if we could take the map of "near me" and move it to a top/central location, potentially like where the blog feature is currently? 

I guess my main takeaway from both your designs AND the current dashboard is that we risk overwhelming people with too many content areas. So that does make me like the idea of trying to combine the Topics/Activity/Blog areas using some of the ideas above. That would leave us with three main zones -- Nearby, Activity, and Participate (although we needn't use those actual words as titles). What do you think?
