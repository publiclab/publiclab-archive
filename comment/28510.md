Hey, [@warren](/profile/warren), I drew some insights from the past proposal to [increase site wide accessibilty](https://publiclab.org/notes/suyash1814/03-07-2020/gsoc-2020-proposal-site-wide-accessiblity-on-publiclab-org) and discovered some contrast issues that can be fixed in accordance with WCAG guidelines which will help people with visual impairments âœ…. Thanks for the suggestion :)
