 Hi, all! Thanks again for your enthusiasm -- I just wanted to note that as [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) has noted, we'll likely be seeking a lot of help with the MapKnitter platform this year. You can read about our upcoming projects in that codebase here:

https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/300

This starts with the MapKnitter Cloud Exporter system: https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/298

But it continues into a lot of other work, as roughly outlined. As we start to get our official project ideas page together, we'll be sourcing a good bit from there, so we'd love to hear some brainstorming around that too!
