The basic trade-off I see is that:  it's actually a pain to reprogram the device with calibration corrections every time you do calibration, even though it seems like it makes it easier in the beginning to get simple units off the device.  So what I've heard suggested often is that you always just get "raw values", and they need to be associated with units outside the device.  So we could maybe just say "parameter 1, parameter 2, parameter 3", and then keep metadata, updated regularly, that describes how to get units from those parameters.  

All that said, to begin with (Beta), to make things easy, we could e.g. say "Temperature in C, and conductivity in frequency"  and then you have to convert frequency using a conversion factor to standard conductivity units, like microSiemens / cm -- and you understand that sometimes you'll want to have a correction factor for the temperature, too.
