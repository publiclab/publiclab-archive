[@sureta](/profile/sureta) would love to hear any updates on this project. It looks like you have several followers here that are also curious. For 2021, Public Lab will be doing some review on our environmental topic areas (including soil). Our teammate [@bhamster](/profile/bhamster) can share more with you when it goes live!
