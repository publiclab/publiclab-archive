Yes, they absolutely wanted the trail to be hard to follow. I did acquire the sample results that were given to the city from the lab they contracted to run the PCE tests. The sampling was not consistent, the data you see in the image shows the only times they sampled up to the latest date. I now have access to the PCE testing results from the EPA. They have been actively sampling since 2018. 

I also discovered an email communication back in 2010 between the water supervisor and the WV Department of Health and Human Resources (they oversee public water infrastructure/drinking water in the state). The water supervisor told state level officials about the discovery of PCE in the water supply and the DHHR responded that the water was fine to drink and the city didn't need to mention it to residents. Shady things going on here!
