I look at this webpage ALL THE TIME:

https://www.balloons.com/HeliumWeightChart.pdf

According to this chart, a regular 11" balloon will lift about .35 ounces (compare it to the 5.5' balloon we use in the kits, which lifts about 5lb). 

At .35 ounces per balloon, that works out to roughly 46 balloons per pound of lift .  So if you had, say, a three pound camera, you'd want about 138 balloon (a three pound camera would be pretty extreme!) 

That said, if you were lifting something like a GoPro (in the neighborhood of 4 ounces) , you could get away with about a dozen balloons. Something like a  cheap point and shoot or old cellphone would probably be  under 7 ounces (give or take)?
