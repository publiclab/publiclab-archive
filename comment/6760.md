Thanks Matthew and Liz! The project as a success, we are going through the video and data now. Hope to think about ways to make this more accessible to DIY monitoring, and solar balloons sound like a great option to reduce costs. In addition to being useful, it's a lot of fun! Still, a lot of the cost is not the balloon, but the hardware on the rig and tracking to retrieve it later...
