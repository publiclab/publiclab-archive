Here is a fantastic message string regarding splitting bamboo: http://www.bamboocraft.net/forums/showthread.php?t=402

Bamboo splitters come in a variety of sizes depending on how thin you'd like your splits to be.  The native bamboo that Mathew mentions is native to the the southeastern US and even grows as far north as PA and NY.  It goes by many other common names but will always answer to Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl. (until botanists change the name in a few years... grumble grumble)
