thanks ygzstc, that makes sense. I think that the approximation that relative intensity measured from the scope can be used in place of the log relationship and is accurate enough. It begs the question how the camera (and software) are determining intensity...voltage across a CCD cell in the camera ? emphasis on the green (twice as many green cells as R and B. If intensity is on a logarithmic scale like sound, which depends on how it is being measured, then yeah, I get the decibel arrangement.

I like the idea that we work with a finite area under a peak, actually integrate an absorbance, but again, I think for a year 12 (senior) chem class, that is a step further.

thanks Jeff, I suspect the problem with images loading might be at my end. The blobs only appear for the spreadsheets, I can still see the jpegs. which suggests my browser is at fault. Good to know the ss can still be seen by everyone else, thanks for spotting this.
