The script will miss substitutions if the data is coming in too quickly --  I put a bunch of delays in the code to slow it down to a point where it worked for me but I didn't delve too deeply into the issue.

You could try increasing the "delay" values in the arduino code and see if that helps.  The amount of delay that you need might be related to the latency of your internet connection.

It could also potentially be an operating system issue with endline characters?  This seems unlikely since the line of code in question is:
     Keyboard.press(KEY_RETURN);

which seems like it should be endline-character-agnostic but I would have to dig a little bit deeper into the Arduino keyboard library to know.

There might be a better way to write the spreadsheet script that I haven't thought about that avoids the issue of however google script handles rapid onEdit events....
