That's a great idea. Last week as I was driving away from the house on the way to Middlebury College to launch the Saturn V Rig at 35Â°, It occurred to me that I should have grabbed a few foot warmers from my huge box of them. It's windy up there near the kite, so some insulation might be needed too. At this point I think adding a couple of batteries is the smartest solution. Six volts doesn't leave enough margin, but seven to nine volts seems to do the trick.
