I didn't know about this, I think is great!! 
If you already have any results of the application of the kit, it would be great that you add it to your website. If you're open-source, I'd love to contribute to implementing the feature, so people using the kit can share their results and experiences (like in Public Lab's website).
Congratulations on the initiative. Regards from Chile!
