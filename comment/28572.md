The freeze-thaw cycle part is also what i've most often heard about the cause of New York City potholes. What i mostly gathered from that is that in "water vs asphalt", water is gonna win, but this would be a good topic for the authors to look into further. Other bits i've heard:  
- If water pools too long on top of the road, due to lack of proper cross slope grading to shed the stormwater runoff or due to clogged drains, that would a contributing factor. 
- If groundwater is high and rises up and buckles the roadbed from below, that would be a contributing factor. 
- Additionally, if roadbeds aren't engineered for the heavy weight of trucks that drive on them, that additional wear-and-tear will break down the layers of paving.
