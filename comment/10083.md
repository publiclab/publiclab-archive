I'm seeing a few interface issues.  I can't make the window large enought to read "disable GPS placement"

Once they're in the upload window, how do I place them? when I click on them it starts a download. I'm not sure how I actually get images into the map, is that the "show/hide" image feature you  are adding?

When I open a new map instance in your demo, I get the old upload interface.
