I know you're looking for a sphere, but I'd instead look for a hydrodynamic shape that can be pulled without a ton of actual "bobbing." on the things-that-need-machining side, I'd look at some diy "towfish" for side-scan sonar and similar activities.  

I second [@warren](/profile/warren)'s suggestion of following the Riffle project into PET bottles, and think some weighting and fins could turn a bottle into a functional enough towfish.  if you need to run wires out of the bottle I can't recommend punching straight through a bottle cap. its hard to keep the sealant sealed to the PE caps.  try this instead:
