Hi willie! Its a great project! I haven't read the Apte documentation, but mobile sensing does create some difficulties in terms of maintaining the accuracy of your data. if the vehicle speed is what forces the air through the sensor then you may get high readings at higher rates of speed that are not necessarily comparable. If you used a vacuum pump to move air through the device you will get the same flow rate no matter the speed and you can then get more accurate and comparable data. 

 I have a very overdue research note to write about the air pumps that we are using for a formaldehyde monitoring project, basically you can take a tetra whisper 100 aquarium pump http://www.tetra-fish.com/Products/tetra-aquarium-parts/whisper-air-pump-60-100-repair-kit.aspx and open it up with a Philips head screw driver and reverse the diaphragm (super simple and I can explain that later). That turns the pump into a vacuum that has a pretty consistent 300 ml/minute pull on it when attached to the formaldehyde tubes we are using. but regardless hooking up a low cost vacuum (like the hacked pump i just described) could help with data consistency! Happy to explain more, as I will post the full research note in a couple weeks.
