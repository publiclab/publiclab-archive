 Thanks [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) for your comment.  Some of it however is not clear to me so I'd appreciate some clarification. You write: "To be reminded that the precision and/or accuracy of the Plantower sensor should be scrutinized, examine Figure 10 here. Note that the relationship among PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 is constant (there is always more PM10 and less PM1). Over the course of two days in my house it is unlikely that the relationship among the three size classes of particles would be that constant."  To my understanding the descriptions of each in terms of aerodynamic diameter have an upper limit but no lower limit. So, particles that fit PM10 are also PM2.5 as are PM1 and there will always be at least as much PM10 as PM2.5, ie PM10 will never be less that PM2.5, etc. And when I examine the figure you refer to, I do not see the relationship as "constant", but though PM10 is always at least as great as  PM2.5, for example, the amount by which it is greater is not constant. Perhaps I am misunderstanding what you are trying to say? Thanks for a clarification.
