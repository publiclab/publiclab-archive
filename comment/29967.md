Our group’s poster talks about what microplastics are and how they affect the health of living organisms and our environment. They come from any object made from plastic, broken down into tiny particles and dispersed everywhere. Microplastics can even be found in the human body, which may cause liver damage, cancer, tissue inflammation, allergic reaction, and cell death. Our bottle is very unappealing on purpose, with murky water and trash scattered on the outside because just like our bottle, microplastics are not pretty.
