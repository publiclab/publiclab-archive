I like that its JSON and that there isn't a hard coded standard. It seems more like a guideline or a best practice, but of course deviation is acceptable.

As an example, a contributor might want to list name, but not email. The JSON structure concedes that possibility without requiring it the way XML might, given a proper DTD.

I'm not sure I understand the `builds_upon` field. If open hardware ends up being like open software, this one field would be some pale comparison of Github's network graph seen on many popular repositories. I just grabbed one of Github's most popular repos this month and here's an example graph: https://github.com/Flipboard/react-canvas/network

A forking, branching, merging network of contributions is best tracked directly by git, mercurial, or something along those lines. Trying to embed that in a human-readable format is going to lead a hairy mess if open hardware becomes anything like open software.
