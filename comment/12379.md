Hi Chris. 
Ok , I had read about the best results of the red filter , compared to blue . What worries me most is the difference in value Area between light and dark areas , and I believe , if I'm not mistaken , it is linked more to a factor of the type of lenses.
Very interesting conversion lenses Mobius ! Thank you very much for the time that you gave me ! I read a lot about it but the language is still a major handicap.
