There are a lot of resources on microscopes on the PL site from over the years:

https://publiclab.org/tag/microscope -- but to list some out:

https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/09-28-2016/diy-microscope-resources refers to [@maxliboiron](/profile/maxliboiron)'s https://civiclaboratory.nl/2016/08/06/diy-microscopes/, a great summary of lots of DIY microscope designs to date.

https://publiclab.org/notes/MicroscopesAreCool/12-05-2016/microscope-from-tablet-computer by [@MicroscopesAreCool](/profile/MicroscopesAreCool) builds on resources from Make Magazine and Instructables, and was from right here in Somerville, MA!

and https://publiclab.org/notes/Holger/11-06-2015/raspberry-pi-based-microscope by [@Holger](/profile/Holger), working from Instructables, who mentioned interest in developing a <$50 kit!
