this is actually an excellent solution to this problem without adding additional parts/complexity. The 1.1v internal reference is much more stable than using the 3.3/5v for ADC readings as well. Still not quite as stable as using an external device with a temperature corrected/calibrated reference voltage, but better.  Might be worth looking at the specs of that and how much the temperature variance of the reference voltage would effect the readings at the resolution we're looking for. ....but it also might not matter in this application.
