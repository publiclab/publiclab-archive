HI [@warren](/profile/warren)
I did not try the Lego hack, as I had no details of what to do and I had the key on order. No pics as I had my hands fully occupied.

I adjusted the lens in situ, just removing the top and a few blocks for access. You have to remove the DVD grating too, of course. Getting the key on the lens surround is a bit fiddly but once the lugs are aligned the adjustment is easy. 

I left the cam connected and the camera image up in the RPiCam web page so I could see the effect of changes. I adjusted about a quarter turn at a time, because there's a slight lag getting to the web image. 

I held a pen at about 80 mm from the lens (that's the approx distance to the collimation slit) and once it looked in focus, I cleaned the grating and rebuilt.
 As you can see, quite an improvement.
