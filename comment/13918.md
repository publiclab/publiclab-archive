Gwill, thanks. I'll take a look.

Dave, It appears you are looking to observe the effect of methylene blue on the 405nm carrier. If so, I'd suggest that you need to try to observe and separate the noise from the signal. Comparing (like your difference plots) single measurement plots can too easily display noise as if it were a meaningful signal.

The noise, in this case, is essentially the repeatability error which is represented by a band, or range of values, the spectrum can display for the exact same measurement. To observe this, setup the system, drop in the sample, grab the data, remove the sample, replace the sample (same sample), grab new data ... repeat 3 to 5 times and then plot the data. I don't see a function in Spekwin32 to automatically show the repeatability band (which is not just the average) but when the plots overlap, the visually 'fuzzy' band which is formed gives a rough visual idea of the repeatability. (When plotting, only display 400 +/-25nm so the noise becomes clearly visible. Remember, the camera data is roughly 1nm/pixel so this is only 50 data points.)

If you did this for a) the reference solution and then b) after methylene blue is added (to that same solution), and again 3-5 measurement cycle data is collected and plotted (overlap), then visually comparing the two plots sets will start to give an indication of any measurable difference. I can imagine how to compare these in matlab, but I'm not familiar enough with spekwin32 to know how to perform this task with that utility.
