Jeff,
Our goal is to have 1) a red channel which records how much NIR is reflecting from plants, and 2) a blue channel which records how much blue light is reflecting from plants, and 3) a ratio between those two channels (in each pixel) that is close to the actual ratio reflecting from the plants.

When you flood the sensor with blue light during custom white balance, you are setting the camera to de-emphasize the light hitting the blue pixels, relative to the red and green pixels.  The value in the blue channel of each pixel will be made smaller, so when the color of each pixel is determined, less blue is involved, and when NDVI is computed the blue value is smaller. The camera does not know how much of the light hitting the blue pixels was NIR (or green or red); it assumes everything getting through the blue Bayer filter is blue.  We donâ€™t know the actual NIR:blue ratio in the ambient light or the NIR:blue ratio of reflectance from the blue paper during custom white balance. We are using the custom white balance process to crudely nudge the camera to modify the ratio of "red" to "blue" in each pixel. If we nudge it just the right amount, the pixels from plants will have a "red:blue" ratio that produces meaningful NDVI. Calibrating this nudge should be possible with a light source of known NIR:blue ratio. So a particular colored card held under a particular light bulb should provide the proper nudge.  What we have been doing outside in sun and shade and clouds, etc is probably too variable to standardize. Maybe what we need is a colored card that works under a compact fluorescent lamp (although they don't seem to emit much NIR).
