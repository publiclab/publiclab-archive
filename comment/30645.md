The high plains aquifer is important because it is the largest aquifer in the United States. It holds 978,000,000,000 trillion gallons of water. And the aquifer lies under the states of Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. But recently the aquifer has been depleting more water than if feels up. This means that eventually the aquifer will eventually dry out. If this happens it will significantly impact the states. Economically it will affect the market of goods having a $20 billion impact on the food industry. The United States would also have to start importing more goods from overseas because of the aquifer’s drainage. In addition, to economic impacts the aquifer also has agricultural impacts as well. As states earlier the aquifer drying up will impact the food market limiting the amount of food the U.S. can produce.
