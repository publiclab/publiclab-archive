[@viechdokter](/profile/viechdokter), yes, it was just an experimental baffle for stray light. Keeping reflections low inside the space between slit and grating is necessary as the slit can let in light from any angle. While the only light we care about is that which is inline with the grating, that doesn't mean that will be the only light traveling inside the enclosure. But, no, the baffle doesn't require rigid mounting in the way that the camera does -- using the same style mounting parts was simple the easiest thing to do and the rigid mount doesn't hurt.
