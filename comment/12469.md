I somewhat agree with [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie).  I'm skeptical that there is value in a through-hole kit because there are only three components a DIYer would want to change, and they'd want to be able to fiddle with them in-process:  the two resistors and a capacitor that define the 555's timer circuit.

 I think we should think about development-specific use-cases:
A through-hole board seems premature in a development scenario, as the resistors or capacitors may need to be changed during the sensor design process. Now, someone can work out their 555 circuit on protoboard, but that's not going to fit down a bottle neck.

So the DIY use case I see is wanting a board where the resistors and capacitors can be easily changed, but also a board that can reliably be attached to the data logger in field conditions.  A through-hole kit doesn't meet this spec.

Either screw terminals or maybe even just 0.1" headers would let someone switch those three components out.  Some balance between the cost of the connector and its reliability will have to be considered.
