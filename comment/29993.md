Hi [@forcha](/profile/forcha), I really like that you outlined the problems you got in your research and included/linked their solutions in your project goals ðŸŽ‰ . I like the mock ups and gifs they give a great  flow of what you have in mind.  Your milestone is well detailed, I like that you included communication with the Outreachy intern each week too. 
I have a few suggestions, I would like it if you could mention any libraries if any  that you will be working with, you could also add any code snippets(existing or  new ) where the changes will be and maybe link us to which files would be involved in some of the changes. Thanks.

_unrelated I really like the banana image ðŸ˜ƒ_

Thanks for posting!
