Liz - I see.  Sure, I can make annotations deletable only by their owners.  Ultimately, though, I really think that annotations should be just as freely editable as map images - I think that annotations should be treated like a visual wiki.  How do we handle annotations going out of date or becoming inaccurate over time?  Especially in areas where Public Lab is very active, the map view will become very cluttered over a period of several years if annotations can *only* be added, not removed or hidden.  We can make annotations more edit-proof by adding editing history for annotations.  This should be a lot easier IMO than for images because there's already a compact JSON representation of annotations (GeoJSON).

Jeff - AHHHH I see.  I didn't realize that was the direction that you folks wanted to take with MapKnitter.  Makes a lot of sense.  I'll keep that in mind as I'm implementing this next stage of changes to make it compatible with the new viewing paradigm as much as possible.

Will also post re: edit history for images soon, if not today, then over the weekend.  I agree that edit history is much more powerful than permissions.
