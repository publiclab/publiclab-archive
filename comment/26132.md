Also, the drinking water standard for nitrates is 10 milligrams per liter (10 mg/l) nitrate-N, or 45 mg/l nitrate-NO3. Most of the consumer tests for nitrates don't test below 70 mg/l. So I don't think this is a good test for people who are concerned about having an answer if their water is safe to drink.
