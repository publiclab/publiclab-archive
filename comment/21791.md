Actually, I think I have my own note wrong, but here's an example of how the Daring Fireball section on ["Paragraphs and Line Breaks"](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#p) differs from what works on the site.  An alternative is that I am misinterpreting what Daring Fireball is articulating.

This is the 1st and a carriage return.
This is the 2nd line and it should be on a line of its own.
This is the 3rd line with two spaces at the end and a carriage return.  
This is the 4th line and it isn't different from the 2nd line.
This is the 5th line and it has two carriage returns.

This is the 6th line and it should have one blank line above.
This is the 7th line and it has two spaces at the end and two carriage returns.  

This is the 8th line and it should have a blank line above.
This is the 9th line and it has two spaces and four carriage returns.  



This is the 10th line and it will only have one line above.
This is the 11th line and it has two spaces and a carriage return for the next 4 lines.  
  
  
  
This is the 12th line and it only has one blank line above.
This is the 13th line and it will have 4 html break tags below.

This is the 14th line and it should have four blank lines above.
