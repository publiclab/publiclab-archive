Hey James - want to use the electronic hydrogen sulfide detector for this test also? It would be good to have a secondary means of measuring, as in the setup you describe, even if strips do darken, there's no way to confirm that it's because of H2S. Though the electronic one is also not calibrated for heat/moisture. We have been meaning to order a heat/moisture sensor to control for those variables.
