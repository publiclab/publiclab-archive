The item that I saw the most often was plastic bags and paper cups. The plastic bags will take about 1,000 years to disintegrate but even then, they wouldn't be completely decomposed because it becomes microplastics. Paper cups will take about 20 years to disintegrate in a landfill but in a lake or an ocean it can take a few days. Communities can be affected by polluted water ways because they could have not enough access to clean water and wouldn't have good water to drink.
