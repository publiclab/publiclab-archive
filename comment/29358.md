Hi all, heres my update-  I took a trip to the plant biology lab and met with the professor that I will be collaborating with. The incubator environment that I will be working with is fridge sized and the plates are about 10 cm by 10 cm. The roots are very small and white against a clear background / see through plate. While observing the roots I have been brainstorming ways of bringing a 3-D element to the image analysis due to the fact that roots don't grow straight down in one line. The curvatures that they grow within contribute to the length of the root growth however just taking 2-D images may not fully represent the root growth in the data. My thought was creating a system in which the raspberry pi camera is able to take photos at a couple different angles slightly enough to create a stackable image that can be processed and analyzed to incorporate the 3-D element. Or maybe having two cameras vertically from each other to get the different angles rather than have the camera move vertically. Still brainstorming tho..
Here is a photo of the plate that I will be working with!
