Also, i checked again and I think the latitude/longitude are getting written incorrectly to the exif data -- on the attached image, see that the latitude (42 deg) seems right, but the longitude is the latitude value, and also offset by some digits (degrees are in minutes area). Are you seeing similar issues when you use the app?
