I really value you both sharing your lived experiences in navigating these challenging processes, action areas, and advocacy pathways around community air quality monitoring and related efforts. That extra bit of information about the Air Alliance Houston Community Air Quality Toolkit and how it differs from other guides you've reviewed during your Fellowship [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1) is eye opening. Perhaps you could make a note of that on the original thread too? [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) thanks for acknowledging the larger systemic issues at play here. Resonating with your comments around identifying the scale in which one may want to contribute to the cause(s) -- and at the same time how it can easily become overshadowed by the realities on the ground and how funding plays out.
