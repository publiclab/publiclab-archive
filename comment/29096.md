Some very good points!  Thank you for the information.  My major concern around northern Ohio has always been nitrate run off from fertilizers.  Fertilizers are absolutely essential, no doubt about it.  But so is drinking water.  The state has limited times when farmers can fertilize the soil.  But still, the run off of nitrates in lake Erie has caused growth of bad bacteria.  This has mostly been in the Toledo area, but it has gotten worse and is working it's way east. Some water intakes have been closed to slow the spread.  Detection?  There are several possible different ways.  There are low cost test papers, ion selective electrodes ( modified pH meters), and satellites.  The nitrates cause the growth of a bacteria that grows a weird shade of green, allowing visible detection by satellite.  And that's just for starters.
