Hello Ned, I'm going to calculate the x,y and rotation offset between the ir and vis pictures by doing a camera alignment with opencv. Becuase my cameras are rigid the offset will not change over time. With this offset, calculating NDVI will be very fast. For every 100 or 200 pictures (need to see if this is needed) the system will ask the user to preform a camera alignment and calculate the new offsets. 
I have some farmers who are interested in this camera.
I also have a farmer who wil sponsor me for a system with 4/5 cameras on it. He wants to calculate NDVI WDVI,NDRE and REP. But that is a summer project. First let get this one finished. Allot of software to write. 3D printed enclosure to make. Keep you guys posted.
