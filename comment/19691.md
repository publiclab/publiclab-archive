Hi [@warren](/profile/warren), thanks for your comment. As you can see these photos, it is our original. We have only information about liner CCD by Toshiba. It is possible to share our technique depending for your offer, if you think collaborating our spectrometer. Please e-mail takeshi_matsumoto@m-seimitsu.com directly.
