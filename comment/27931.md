Thom,
A "tripod" of lines may help stabilize the balloon somewhat, and is a good idea. 

However, the problem of balloon stability is not just about the lines, but also about the forces acting on the balloon, specifically the wind and the lift of the gas. A solar balloon has very limited gas lift for its volume, and a large surface area affected by the wind.

In practice, this means that even a very slight breeze (i.e. 2-3mph, 3-5kmh) can drive a tethered solar balloon to the ground. A solar balloon is best flown an an extremely still, windless and sunny day. 

I will usually identify the slight breeze that exists and plan the travel path of the balloon around the breeze. I'll start on the windward side of the site and walk downwind with the balloon until the edge of my site is reached. Then I'll take the balloon down, move to a new upwind location, and repeat.
