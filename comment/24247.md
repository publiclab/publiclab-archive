 Marking your kite or balloon line is a very good way to do this. It is a bit of a chore to do it, but maybe easier than building a data logger or flying your phone. If the balloon line is vertical, you can always know the approximate altitude. Kites fly at different angles, but when your kite line is at 45°, the altitude of the kite is the line length multiplied by 0.7. The result can be adjusted if your kite (or balloon) is flying higher or lower than 45°. This might be good enough for your purpose.

Jack's solutions can provide very precise results after the flight. Barometric pressure is easy to measure and gives very good altitude estimates. A data logger to collect good altitude data every 10 seconds during the flight can be made for less than $10.
