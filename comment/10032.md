I'm doing a test today putting one bottle of 3 identically prepared Onta [#1](/n/1) samples of crude in mineral oil in the freezer, to see if temperature affects fluorescence in our setup, as [some of the earlier papers](/notes/warren/08-12-2014/survey-of-different-kinds-of-fluorescence-spectrometry-optimizing-intensity) suggested. 

For humic, we really need to know how much light gets us "saturated" -- need to do a search for "fluorescence saturation" and look for quantified amounts of light, and compare to our laser. Empirically, we could also shine the laser through, then filter out 50% and compare where the top of the peak is... if we get lucky and our lasers are strong enough to saturate, we could see a red or blue shift.
