It really depends what you wish to measure. For example some algae change color of water, so you can measure them directly. I would suggest first of all try to understand the process of light absorption - tryi to measure different light sources, verify calibration, measure spectra of colored objects such as glass, foil, soda... study spectra in both modes ("regular" and RGB). I am sure you will find a way your spectrometer can be useful then.
