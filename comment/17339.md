Hi [@momosavar](/profile/momosavar),
it uses the ek-tm4c123gxl.  The voltage range of the model 5 potentiostat is limited to +/- 1.65 volts.  The newer model 7 will go to +/- 5 volts.  We have been working on a newer model (7.2) that will have a larger current range and be able to switch voltages faster.  I hope that we will be able to finish prototyping the  7.2  in the next couple of weeks.  The printed circuit boards for the model 5 and 7 can be ordered pretty cheaply from OSHPark.com (https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/yepeXPFo and https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/ESaBVpCE).  Once I finish prototyping the 7.2, I will make that circuit board available as well.  
Let me know if you have trouble finding any of the documentation or files.
Best regards,
Jack
