 I agree that your setup looks good. Of course you could test your battery to see if it's fresh. The only other thing besides making sure connections are secure are the two wires that lead to the water sample--you may want to try regular wires because the ones you are using have posts that sometimes can be loose in the holes of the breadboard. Also, is that coffee you are testing? Curious what that sounds like 😆
