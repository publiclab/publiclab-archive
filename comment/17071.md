Thanks [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) -- that's definitely what we're looking into! So many of DC's food deserts and low-income areas are also by far the hottest, from what data we've seen so far. As city policymakers think about green space investments in these parts of the city, there are so many factors to consider (food production, community spaces, etc) but addressing urban heat island and air pollution in these areas is part of it too!
