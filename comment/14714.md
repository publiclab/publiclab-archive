George, that's my experience too. I was in a rush to update the sketch on an Arduino so I installed the Arduino IDE on a new Windows 10 machine and plugged in the board and no go, I had to use an old computer. A few days later I prepared to beat my head against it and it was working fine. 

Arduino requires patience.
