[@warren](/profile/warren) , in distinguishing between content thats most important vs. whats most recent means we filter as follows:
top overall, most recent, new this week and recent updates? 

I dont like glyphicons, so I'll probably use [Font awesome ](https://fontawesome.com/) I mean, for the nav-pills.

Do you like the header section?

I'll work on the feedback in the next update.
