This is cool, one possible approach would be to add preset points along the slider matched to different configurations of the microscope kits(settings for the different array/lens combinations).   This would assume there isn't that much variation between kits since they have the same lens to object distance.  In order to do this we have to take calibration pictures for each configuration and then create slider reference points.

This could also be done in image sequencer using overlay and grid modules.  

So is this approach reasonable or is a calibration transfer (the method described in the front part of this post) always considered necessary?
