Scott,  
CHDK will provide a better intervalometer, but it can't sync the shutters without an external signal. So you need something to send a 5v pulse to both cameras simultaneously. CHDK can help by responding to the pulse by preparing to shoot (focus, exposure, etc) and then wait for the next pulse to fire both shutters at exactly the same time. So you need 4 AAA batteries, a timer, and a USB Y cable. This might be the cheapest solution: http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/7-12-2012/shutter-timer-upgrade. I might assemble a couple of these.
