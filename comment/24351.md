 Hi [@silentsairam](/profile/silentsairam) - if you've tested it out and are confident that it'll be taking timelapse photos for up to 1 hour reliably, i think you can go for just that! 

Your camera is infrared, or visible? I think it's infrared/infragram, so then you might not have normal-colored photos, so that's the only drawback.
