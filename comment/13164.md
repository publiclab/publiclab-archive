Thanks! the cleaning filters, then, are very narrow-pass filters to ensure the green input laser is only the 532nm light? 

And is Raman mostly/always/often done with a green laser? I'm not that familiar with it, but how do the fluorescence spectra and the raman scattering interact or are separated? Is it ideal to minimize fluorescence? For example, is there a Raman method with a 405nm laser? Just curious. Thanks!
