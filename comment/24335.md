Yes, so far I'm trying to accomplish all those 3 points. As for the slit, I made it from a razor blade so it should fulfill the criteria. I compared it with the acetate 0.09mm slit and it's a relatively similar width (just a visual comparison after taking a photo).

I'm curious regarding the lines/cm of your previous tests, because according to the equation (diffraction angle = asin(L/d)) you mentioned, a greater # of lines/cm should mean a wider spread. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think maybe it was the DVD that had 1200 lines/cm and maybe the film had ~740; that should have resulted in the DVD causing a wider spectral spread.

I'm interested to see how my grating and DVD compare.

As for a better mounting for the holographic film, I'm toying with the idea of sandwiching it between two metal washers, and having some way to clamp them together. But I think I'll sleep on it and see if there are any other ideas that come up.
