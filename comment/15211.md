Hi, I have taken some images directly from a Canon SX280 with a red filter. Then I calibrated it using the reflectance from red paper in the shade
[![IMG_0263.JPG](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/740/large/IMG_0263.JPG)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/740/original/IMG_0263.JPG)

. And then took some images. Then I used the infragram NDVI index calculator. But the results were not at all close to the desired results. Can you guide me on what changes do I need to make to get the desired results?
