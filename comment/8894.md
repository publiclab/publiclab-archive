you know, if the little color filters in Mobius cmos sensor Bayer array have the same [spectral response](http://www.astrosurf.com/luxorion/Physique/spectral-response-ccd.jpg) as some of the CCD sensors I've seen around the web, all three bands should have about the same response at 850nm.   It would be interesting to see what would happen to the histograms if you used a 750nm LED.
