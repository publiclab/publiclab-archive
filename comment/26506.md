Hi [@natalie_stjean](/profile/natalie_stjean) awesome proposal you had here!
I see and like your mock-ups, and i want to know please how you came up with the mock-up or what tool you used.  I've been reading about creating mock-ups for coding solutions but i've not been able to entirely wrap my head around it.

your reply could help me. 
Did you write code for the mock-up?
