Actually, Fiji needs as CSV file to work on.  So, I copied and pasted your text file into EXCEL and deleted the top line.  Each column in your text file needs to be in a separate column in the excel file.  So, saved as a csv file and then used the LUT IMPORT plugin to bring the csv file up then used IMAGE>COLOR>EDIT LUT to save the LUT file.  You can also invert the gradient and save the invert too - which I did.  I have tried attaching the files but for some reason they don't want to upload.  If you have trouble creating your own LUT files, send me your e-mail to mine as aswicks@gmail.com I will send them to you.
