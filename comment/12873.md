I am leaving on a work trip and coud not make the measurements. Only did the dilutions for the unknowns and the standards. When I com back I will troubleshoot final adjustments and conduct measurements. Hopefully 1 or 2 days of work. I have seen some of your posts in terms of adjustments of the instruments. Ill keep them in mind.
