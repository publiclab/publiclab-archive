Oh those are great finds! I would think for $18 that is probably just as (if not more) affordable as making it one's self (including labor time). I'm not sure if there is an epistemological gain from making this device one's self (no hidden process or mystifying technologies inside). But making it can still be fun :) I wish all enviro monitoring tools could be as beautifully simple as secchi disks.
