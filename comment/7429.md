Hi Thorsten, Sorry for the confusion. Some of the non-linearity between the response of the red and blue filter should be explained in the post I did on Friday: http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/11-01-2013/why-a-red-filter-should-work-well-for-ndvi

With the red filter there is a bigger difference between green grass and dead grass when compared with a blue filter.  If it's still not clear just ask again I'll see if I can do a better job explaining the difference. 

If your application can accommodate a dual camera system that will almost certainly produce better results but it comes with the drawback of being a little more cumbersome and you need to deal with parallax. With a dual-camera setup you will have 4 data points on a spectral curve (R,G,B,NIR) instead of two and you also eliminate the problem of NIR light leaking into the visible bands. And, you also get a normal color photo which can be useful.
