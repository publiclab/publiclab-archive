Cool, thanks for your results!

Chrome Android â†’ Chrome Android did work for me, but not very well. Sometimes I had to repeat sending like 10 times to get one reception, or the received data looks like sh**t. 
Funny but probably not very usefull: loopback. Played some sounds and the same device recognized it.
