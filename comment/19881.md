Hi [@the_butler](/profile/the_butler) 
I've used Fusion360 for the design. Here you can find the .stl files and also the fusion source file.

This design was made for the fan to be attached to a wall of the enclosure. 
One thing you should do is to seal the gaps between the shinyei and the pcb. 
Let me know if I can help you with something else.
Saludos
