[@warren](/profile/warren) I actually did not create that list / documentation. However, once I get a functioning air sensor I do planning on creating similar documentation on this Public Lab platform with the updated materials list! Also, I will definitely look into the quality of the usb charger I am currently using and test if that is causing any problems. Thanks!!
