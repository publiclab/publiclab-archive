Pat, this is great progress. It looks like you stitched a 360 panorama. Two seconds is really quick. It might be hard to settle the camera for the shot at that speed. Is it possible to slow the speed of the servo? That might reduce the time it takes to settle down after a rotation. Some of the photos are a little blurry from motion. Did you have a slow shutter speed or was the motion too much for 1/800 second? It's really great that you can just modify the sketch to adjust speed and timing. For single servo (rotation only) panoramas, you can capture more of the scene with the camera in portrait position. Maybe you can make a jig to hold the camera sideways. Your kite behavior could have been the wind changing direction. I hope it pulled out of the dive.
