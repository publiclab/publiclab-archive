Hi, FortunaWolf - what resolution do you need, is probably the first question. I think the DVD will probably not be the limiting factor but if the basic kit is not sufficient, there are lots of things you can do to tighten up the resolution, but it's work, so perhaps you can start with a goal. One thing you can do is put it in a rigid housing -- there are some being developed here (see comments especially):

Are you building on some existing research you've found on pollen spectrometry, or trying something entirely new? 

Re: webcams, there are some phones which can connect to webcams, but there are no UVC drivers on Android, so they work via apps (as far as I can tell). I haven't had success with it, though would love to see it happen. Perhaps if you're looking for miniaturization, a Raspberry Pi would be a way to go? 

The software is open source, indeed: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench

And we recently spun out the JavaScript analysis core for independent use: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js (usable in Node.js, though [no live-capture yet](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/issues/17)). 

Hope that helps!
