[@jenjimah](/profile/jenjimah) I also struggled with this and give your workaround using OBS a go. Let's see...keep you posted! :)

[@warren](/profile/warren) has anyone tried to use the raspberry pi as the main computer, not installing the special Public Lab image but a different one, hooking it up to a screen and then access the spectral workbench over a browser on the pi itself? That should work, shouldn't it?
