 Hi everyone! My name is Igor Wilbert, I'm a computer science from Brazil and I'd like to join GSoC 2019 with Public Lab. Thank you Mr. Warren for introducing me to this post. So far I had two different ideas:
1) Create a mobile version of Public Lab website. I think this is interesting because it can increase the organization popularity (number of people reached) quite a lot. We could start with something simple, an Android app with login, ask, answer and search question functionalities, about us section and maybe others.
2) Incorporating the GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation project into the research papers search, or create a search tool dedicated to it. Its learning capabilities might be quite interesting.
Please let me know what do you think. See you!
