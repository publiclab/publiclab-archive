Thanks so much [@liz](/profile/liz) [@stevie](/profile/stevie) and [@bronwen](/profile/bronwen) for your input. Liz, I think it's a fantastic idea to use existing data to inform where we'd like to go deeper. [@lprashad](/profile/lprashad) [@donblair](/profile/donblair) [@karenv](/profile/karenv) or [@nedhorning](/profile/nedhorning): would you be open to chatting briefly about this? In particular, wondering how does ASTER / LANDSAT data compare to "experienced temperatures" on the ground, particularly in shaded areas?
