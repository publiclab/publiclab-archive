On staff we've started talking more about "methods" rather than "tools" to acknowledge more clearly that there's a big difference between a hardware build and a more complete methodology you do with it (and a specific aim and use case). This is part of the general shift we're hoping to encourage to better-documented activities. 

That said, the categories are intended not only to apply to existing posts, but to inspire and shape the re-formatting of existing posts into more clearly easy-to-follow activities, rather than more passive accounts of simply "what I did." In many cases this might more easily mean posting a followup post that rehashes the steps originally presented, but more in the format of a guide. 

But for new content, we're hoping for more "Here's how to do this thing I did, try it and tell me if you got the same result, and if I can improve this guide" as opposed to "check out this random thing I'm working on" -- though the latter is still of course welcome insofar as it can be presented more in the format of the former. 

As to the observe/field-test categories -- I think this is true, and agree that there are other categories that could be confused or potentially merged. One reason we put out all these together was to see what people think, and what sticks, basically. In general I hope people clearly state the goal of their activity -- and we will probably need to help/remind people to distinguish between verifying that something "works as expected" and testing the limits, like "how high a resolution can I get".
