This is super, and very impressive, Dave. I have a number of comments/questions, but I'll start with just a few:

1. I'm very surprised to hear that EVO did not fluoresce for you, and that you're using it as a baseline/solvent -- it had very clear pinkish fluorescence when I [tested it](/notes/warren/10-1-2012/ultraviolet-fluorescence-bp-oil-residue-and-olive-oil) on [multiple occasions](/notes/warren/08-19-2014/ultra-micro-cuvette-tests-uv-led-and-low-temperature-fluorescence).

2. The effects of diluting crude oil may have multiple sources, but one is called "quenching" in the published literature, and is when the color of the liquid itself (as you describe) filters some wavelengths out. This can clearly affect the peak height wavelength position. 

3. [@ethanbass](/profile/ethanbass) had suggested at the Barnraising that we could standardize the opacity of solutions, rather than their concentration, by using absorption spectroscopy, or even an opacity reference card. Thoughts?

4. I especially appreciated your graph of "repeatability error" and wonder if you'd considered using averaged data in your later analyses, using repeated scans to improve signal to noise. Maybe you did and I missed this. 

More thoughts soon! There's a lot in here. Thanks as always, and I must also note that you're an impressive woodworker!
