 [@TGUY](/profile/TGUY), sure, spekwin32 now has a hardware control prototype program, just like plug 'n' play. my whole set can be seen on my project site here at hackaday: http://hackaday.io/project/11412-homemade-spectrometer-plab-v25-mod-301

When you download spekwin32 please read all the help files Dr. Menges put them together very straight forward and very well put together, and any help you need along the way feel free to ask me for help I really don't mind, I am a retired electrical engineer and I have the time.
