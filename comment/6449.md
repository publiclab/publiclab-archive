I use those little tripods for my pole and quadcopter too. Very handy. For my kite pendulum I take off the legs and attach the ball-joint clamp thingy to a piece I made using InstaMorph that is inserted into the bottom of the pendulum. I'd like to order a bunch of just the ball-joint pieces but the ones I've seen cost more than the whole tripod. I'd add a photo but not sure how to do that.
