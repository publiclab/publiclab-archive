Hi! Neat idea. Thanks for posting! 
Exploring this further, I don't know much about bots, but I think it could be really helpful for newcomers. Just because I don't know much about bots:

- Could we articulate who sees the bot? for example only first time posters? 
- Where might the bot live? On the dashboard or in different places around the site?

 For the sake of wondering if this is a good fit, does anyone know:

- What could be some of the drawbacks? Does anyone have "bad bot" experience? (great posts above [@warren](/profile/warren))
- Anyone know of any user studies on the effectiveness of bots? What about in comparison to instructional videos. 
- One concern I have would be making sure it doesn't overwhelm or frustrate users, what are ways we can make sure people only see the bot when they want to?

No worries if you don't know the answers to these, and maybe some of them are flexible based on what would be built. Interested in exploring further.
