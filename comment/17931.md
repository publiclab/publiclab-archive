[@warren](/profile/warren) [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1) -- it's true that we _did_ try a bunch of different lights, and the best we found was a single LED.  But the main reason this was true, I think, is that it was really obvious where the light was coming from so we could easily point it through the slide and into the lens.

I think any light that's sufficiently bright and even is fine.  The trick is that most of the cheap lights I've been able to find are made up of a bunch of LEDs so they don't actually light evenly, even with a diffuser, so it's hard to point them correctly.  But I think it would be possible to find a good off-the-shelf light, but it would involve some research and trial and error.
