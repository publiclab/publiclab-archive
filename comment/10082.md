Thanks!  Yeah we've kept the data site hidden for a while because we're going to move it to the main site pretty soon.  But you can find the current version at photosynq.venturit.net.  Here's an example of the data explorer function: http://photosynq.venturit.net/projects/spad-field-comparison/explore_data (not sure, but you may need to create a login to view).  We have about 3 active projects, the largest has about 3400 data points.  We're making improvements to speed right now, so we hope to be able to comfortably do 10 - 20k data points (with wait times for download of course, but point is it shouldn't crash your browser :).  You can plot any of the fields against each other, do histogram, averages, etc.  And you can filter (right hand side) the data to create separate series.  I don't know if you get a full sense of what it can do from this, but you'll get the idea.  Pushing data to the database is just a JSON with a specific structure, not too hard.  

All the code is on github on the PhotosynQ page.  We have a company doing the database and android app, so their stuff is private until they are comfortable with the quality then it'll be open - if you want to see it beforehand I'm sure I can share it just let me know.
