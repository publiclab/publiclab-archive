Hi, Rebeccah -- looks like your lead image didn't work -- maybe try again, or email it to web@publiclab.org if you can't get it to upload? 

I'm interested in if this could be formatted as a question (see our new Q&A feature here: https://publiclab.org/questions) or potentially as an activity others could try to replicate (as on our prototype "activity grids" we've been trying out here in the Spectrometry project: https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry#Activities

If you're interested, I'm happy to offer some input on how your post could fit into one of these two systems to solicit more concrete input!
