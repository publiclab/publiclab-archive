I can actually provide a, perhaps, useful comment to your drone question.  One reason I chose to use the 130IS was that it is very light.  Mine weighs in at only 113 g with the battery and card inserted.  With the gimbal I use I can actually attach two of these cameras in nadir, with one oriented in reverse of the other.  I've done some test flights with both cameras attached and the copter was flying just fine.  I'm just a couple grams over the stated maximum takeoff limit, so the maximum flight time is reduced by a couple minutes.  I can live with that though.
