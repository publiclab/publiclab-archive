You can visit the following page:

http://www.upb.edu/en/contenido/smartphone-spectrometer

Here is a free software, the description of how to assemble a spectrometer and use the camera of your cell phone.

In this other web page you can find the description of the calibration:

All this is for an android platform, but the spectrometer is very easy to build and for calibration you only need a conventional fluorescent lamp.

Best regards...
