Hi Alex, I would recommend contacting Charlie Langlois at Labsphere- clanglois@labsphere.com They can make affordable($300 range)targets that are smaller 2X2" pieces that work great with same quality and accuracy as the targets that cost thousands.
The formula I used in the above comparison subtracted around 40% of the pixel value in the red channel. I imagine it can be very different with different sensors and filters. It also changes based on the shutter speed, ISO as well so you will have to play with it to see what you can get. Luckily I had the RedEdge camera and a Greenseeker to verify values and know what I was aiming for in the formula modification.
