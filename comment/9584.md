Apparently Onset manufactures HOBOs to be NIST traceable, but they charge more money for units that pass a calibration test. Jeremy buys the less expensive units and tests them in an ice bath to ensure accuracy at the freezing point. The same could be done for DIY sensors. [@btbonval](/profile/btbonval) has [already done something like this.](http://publiclab.org/notes/btbonval/07-14-2014/calibrating-dht11-sensors) Inexpensive sensors probably have to be tested at temperatures throughout their range, and we don't really know how many would fail.

The published operating temperature range for Arduinos is -40° C to 85°C.  A custom board like the Riffle with an Atmel chip might have to be tested at -40° C.

My proposal to cable sensors to a central microcontroller might not scale well. For the 50 installations I propose, about 2000 feet of cable would be needed. That much good cable like the RS485 that [@gpenzo](/profile/gpenzo) suggests would cost about $1000 ($5 per sensor cluster). And somebody would have to solder 1500 sensors (x 2 leads), etc, etc. 

Using radios as [@amysoyka](/profile/amysoyka) suggests instead of cables would require a radio (plus battery) at each sensor cluster (which at about $20 per Xbee) would probably eliminate any cost saving over proprietary stand-alone loggers.

Because Jeremy already has the proprietary data transfer devices, hacking the data transfer does not provide much benefit. Buying the transfer devices was a trivial part of the investment so far.
