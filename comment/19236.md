Ah, not sure about "signup through providers" as [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) highlights. To [@warren](/profile/warren)'s question about sequence, i agree. We need to have some nice flow charts to keep track of what additional "onboarding" moments need to happen as we diversify the ways people create accounts. SHould we use our favorite Google Spreadsheets https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12NU6V9UFeOWKJrql8AIQZI3mKUWTuakF8zrGpOlgrNg/edit#slide=id.g3616e40dc0_0_0 ?
