This is very good data -- two independent reports that moss grows under deciduous forests in Sweden. Martenskram suggested two hypotheses that could explain why these Swedish forests differ from my Vermont forest:

1) There are fewer or smaller trees in the Swedish forests so there are fewer leaves.  
2) Something removes the leaves fast enough that moss is not smothered by them.

Do grasses or herbs also grow under these forests? That would suggest that there is a lot of light and maybe more active organic matter turnover.   
Are the forests young? Maybe the moss is residual from a time when a few small trees produced fewer leaves.  
Are the trees small or widely spaced? Vermont has warmer summers (and colder winters) than Stockholm and might support more productive forests. So maybe there are not enough leaves produced in the Swedish forests to smother the moss.

There are lots of deciduous forests in Vermont with big populations of European earthworms in the soil and the leaves are eaten very fast. I don't recall that moss was common in those forests (maybe the worms eat the moss too). My forest apparently does not support many introduced earthworms.

It's very easy to find deciduous forests here with very little moss on the ground.
