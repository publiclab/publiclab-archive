Thanks for these great updates, [@maya_mohanty](/profile/maya_mohanty)! Seeing the photo of your plate made me think of the [lettuce see bioassay](https://publiclab.org/wiki/bioassay#Lettuce+seed+bioassay+for+soil+or+water), where stunted root growth can indicate environmental pollution. Could you see your work potentially applying to that procedure?
