Love this! Super ðŸ˜ƒ 

> Our breadboards didn't have nice Vcc or Ground sections like those pictured in the activity, so we decided to use one row of pins at the top of the board as Vcc and a row at the bottom as the ground.

I worried about this but the smaller ones are so cute! [@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2) worked on some materials for the smaller boards when we were at [#makerfaire](/tag/makerfaire) ... the larger boards are not much more expensive. I'm torn. I'm glad you didn't seem to think it was a terrible problem. 

I would LOVE to see your written instructions! We're thinking of doing an activity like this with Clara S. from Brown and this is really great to see. Thanks for sharing!!
