This is just using the circuit etc that has been posted here, I will make the explicitly clear in the text in a moment.  So I don't really have a step by step to add.  Or is there something specific you are after? i.e. how the colour mapping is done onto the temperature scale, may be?

The code does something similar to what Jeff has written, I think?  However, you are able to specify the minimum and maximum temperatures and then the colour output will be adjusted to suit.  Suppose you can call it dynamic scaling.  It is not fixed in the manner that is discussed here - http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/2-16-2012/thermal-flashlight-temperature-key

I plan to make it so that you can flick a switch to change the minimum temperature between two values, and then a second switch to change the maximum temperature.  Hope to use that so that limit the times that have to connect and recode the Uno board.  At a guess the selectable temperatures will probably be 10 & 15 and 25 & 30, but will have to see.  Will probably depend on the season etc.  When I do that, I will put up full details on what I have done, plans etc.

If someone can tell me the coding to use on the page to make the Arduino code to appear as it has for others like Jeff, that would be great.
