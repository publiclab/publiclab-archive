[@warren](/profile/warren) Hi, sry I'm a little busy recently... Let me re-state my very immature and personal thoughts with this updated diagram.(I also rewrite some of my proposal) The target of my proposals is to make this project a mature and "complete" projects that not only providing a excellent web application instead of a incomplete demo but also provide all modules API-ify -- At least I think that's most complete open source project do for their Phase 1. For current stage of this project, we don't have much modules, we don't have a complete demo, not to say we have any "multiply applications". We just say at least we providing so many modules that can make people use? Like a NPM library? people nowadays rare trust any start up NPM libraries, and making server side module API-ify usually is not in early stage of startup projects do. Even your aim for this project is indeed just want to building some libraries contributing to NPM community and making a lot people building their applications leverage your modules... I will still say I think rearrange whole structure and give a perfectly demo is more important. (Make modules API-ify is so easy to done, but make them competitive is hard)
