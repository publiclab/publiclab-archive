Hi folks!  

[@stevie](/profile/stevie) -- SORRY for the long delay in my response!  It'd be great to set up a time to chat about this -- and bring in others who know more about how the tech works (seem to be a bunch of related threads on publiclab.org about it) ... 

[@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) -- Ah, great!  I think what we'd be developing here would be about the same level of complexity, at least initially, as what you're probably doing right now.  But maybe we can simplify things ... haven't looked at this in a while, and never made the actual boards, but it'd be great to shoot for having at least a rough prototype to play with at the Barnraising ... will try!
