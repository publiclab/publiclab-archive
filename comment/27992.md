Thanks for the support as always Jeffrey!

Your comment just made me realize that I made a mistake trying to rush and get this blogpost done! 

Yeah, the safe navigation operator `&.` which I write about is distinct from the usage that you mention in your comment: `array_of_objects.collect(&:id)` (and the query I write about). `&.` versus `&:`. Oops. 

I remember when I was working with that `&:` query originally, I had to do some intense Googling, and I was able to find [this article](https://www.brianstorti.com/understanding-ruby-idiom-map-with-symbol/) explaining it. It seems like this phenomenon doesn't have a specific name to describe it! So much to learn!
