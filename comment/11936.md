Hi [@warren](/profile/warren),

Yes, ODM would need just images, ideally with geo info as well. I suppose the most useful thing for ODM to return would be transformation matrices based on the matches, but if MapKnitter can take point pairings, than that's certainly the easiest thing for ODM to return.  What do matches look like now in MK?

I'm not sure what you mean by checksums for interest points.

Love the idea of low res manipulation with MK. That could make for some p. quick workflows.
