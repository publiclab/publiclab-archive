 [@lekhidugtal](/profile/lekhidugtal) good to hear from you ðŸ˜ƒ 
In the original design proposed by the style guide of Public Lab, it was having the map sections and the card UI on the left side and the profile basic information on the right side. 
So I just interchanged the two to maintain the consistency with the other pages. Since on many other pages, the map is mostly present on the right side of the page.
