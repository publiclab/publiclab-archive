Thanks for the in depth answer Chris! If i needed to use this system in low light or night, do you think I would need to add NIR light, or is there some present in a regular led light? As I said above to William, by the looks of your examples above I might loose the weed in the image using NIR. I can play with both and see which one works best. Thanks again, Adam
