 Hi Chris,
Thanks for your answer! Very helpful.

1) Regarding the reflectance targets. I bought a dozen of ceramic tiles in different colours (including white, grey and black), which I can bring to the camera conversion company for reflectance measurement using a spectrometer. I won't be able to have these targets in each photo, but I was thinking of taking a photo of them every 50 shots or so. Do you think it would be sufficient?

2) Regarding white balance - still not sure if it's better to keep using the same WB on all days, or set it manually every day (e.g. on my red tile). I hope that calibration using my reflectance targets and adjusting the photos later in post-processing will solve the problem.

3) Regarding WB data in RAW files - I'm converting my ORF images to DNG and then processing them in Matlab where I can get (and change, if needed) the channel multipliers.

4) Regarding the contamination of the red channel with NIR - I bought two lens filters - a Hoya R72 (infrared) and a Hoya UV+IR cutoff. Each time I take a measurement of my reflectance targets, I'm planning to put the camera on the tripod and take three pictures:
- with no filter on the lens (R: red and near infrared, B: near infrared),
- with Hoya R72 filter (R: near infrared, B: near infrared),
- with Hoya UV+IR cutoff (R: red, B: little bit of red?).

My thinking is that by comparing the channel values for different targets in these three pictures should help me estimate the contamination of the red channel with NIR - at least in case of my targets. But is the contamination the same when taking a photo of a plant, the reflectance of which is so different in red and near infrared? I could of course put a plant or two next to the tiles when taking the 'reference' images, but would one plant be representative of both healthy and stressed plants? Any insight would be most welcome...
