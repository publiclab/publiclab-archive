Hi Chris,

Thank you very much for elaborate me more about filter and also for clear up my confusion.

I read your research note regard the Dual bandpass filter. I shared below link for your information.

I want to capture the image after placing this dual band filter.I have infragram 's point & shoot,OV5642 and OV2640 camera. I below shared these camera detail link for your reference.

So,please suggest me camera module from the above which can give better result for this filter.

Please let me know if you need more information from my side.
