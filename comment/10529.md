More so convenience, but yeah, I am working in upgrading it so the slit. An be moved back & forth to allow more/less light through in the model using a loo roll.

Also, I was using black card around the insides to absorb most of the stray light.

Other than that, sorry, I'm not an expert in this field, so wouldnt know what else could be used other than that.

Thanks for your reply.
