That's a gorgeous spectrum, maybe the best I've seen from a DVD. Is there more information to be gained from using more of the spectrum? A single line of pixels will produce a spectral graph. I have had good luck with thin sheets of grating material, although that problem of flimsy sheets not being flat always bothered me. Have you demonstrated that the peaks from a standard source (e.g., CFL) are displaced when you use thin grating sheets? Do you ever see the 405nm mercury peak in your CFL spectra? It was always ephemeral when I used a DSLR to record the spectrogram.
