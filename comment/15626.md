Yes, it'd also be helpful if you could share any links or knowledge you have that you're working to reproduce in a DIY manner -- for context. 

Actually I think there are answers to a number of these questions -- could you repost them as separate questions and we can try to help link you with the answers?

* Does anyone know how to remove this filter?
* Also, if anyone has actually used this spectrometer with solids before
* In scanning solids, do you know any other challenges that you faced with or without the infrared? 
* Did you use the spectrometer in the same way? (can you link to some example or scientific paper for comparison?)
