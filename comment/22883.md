Also keep in mind that the rules that apply to balloons and kites have a lot to do with the altitude you plan on flying, but there are definitely differences between kites and balloons (which are considered moored objects) and drones, (which are considered as unmanned aircraft), from a regulatory standpoint, though there are additional considerations in regards to size, altitude, etc (doing a low altitude flight over a yard or community garden is generally not subject to the same kind of oversight as, say, putting a kite 1,000 feet up in the vicinity of a runway would be). 

In addition to the link that [cfastie](/profile/cfastie) provided, you might want to look here [https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/150-5200-28F.pdf](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/150-5200-28F.pdf) to see more info about coordinating higher altitude kite or balloon flighting with local  airspace regulators. : 
 and here: [https://www.faa.gov/uas/](https://www.faa.gov/uas/) for info about where drones may be flown (be advised that your city or municipality may have additional regulations: where I live in NYC they are illegal to fly regardless of airport proximity, though in practice there are plenty of casual drone operators who are either unaware or unconcerned by that fact).
