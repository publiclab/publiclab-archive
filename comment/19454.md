Hello [@niklasjordan](/profile/niklasjordan)! Cindy here in the UK - would love to chat about your initiative and the infrastructure you've already built/setting in motion and how that can connect with some of the work we're doing in our various projects. As [@liz](/profile/liz) mentioned, we've done some work with folks in Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands.
