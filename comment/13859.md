dave stoft did a great analysis with different oils https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/01-26-2016/otk-proto3-analysis

and to me it seems to concure with my results today, since 10w40 is a much lighter type oil you can see the same tell tale "hump" on the descending line, and then on the graph for the 308nm scan you see a more defined vertical drop point for the light refined oil which looks the same for the sets I did today and on the graph I posted.
