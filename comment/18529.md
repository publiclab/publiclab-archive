Hi [@mridulnagpal](/profile/mridulnagpal) , i have this doubt that this feature  :  https://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc-ideas#Interactive+Project+Maps , do we have to include in leaflet-blurred library OR do we have to make an API of near-by projects and show the markers on normal leaflet-maps and then generate an alternative-view .

The only confusion i am having is that do we have to implement these features in plot2 directly (as written in idea description) OR in leaflet-blurred-library . 

Thanks so much for helping :) :) .
