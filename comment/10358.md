Scott, we have many Infragram tricks up our sleeves. But the red image above is just a snapshot of the false color IR version of the "blue" Infragram (using a red Wratten 25A filter) which can be seen in the [Gigapan embed in this note.](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/09-19-2014/leaffest-aerials) It is made by swapping the red and blue channels of the bluish Infragram photo so NIR is red and red is blue and green is green, and the result superficially resembles an NRG CIR where NIR is red, red is green, and green is blue.  I guess some of the things up our sleeves can be a little confusing.
