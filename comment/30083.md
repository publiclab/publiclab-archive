Hi [@warren](/profile/warren) !
Thankyou for a detailed feedback. I appreciate how you've gone through the details of my design. 
And yes, I did try out the implementation of help bubble and the questions' table. You can find it here : 

<a href="/i/46217"><i class="fa fa-file"></i> AwesomeScreenshot-4_20_2022_2_21_21PM.mp4</a>

the likes and comments are hidden initially and as a user, I think it makes sense. ðŸ˜… because the questions are hyperlinked.

Yes, dropping the footer sounds valid. I added it because I wanted to give the current one a makeover.
