I'm not sure what the problem is with that Picavet model. It was designed in Sketchup, and it is scaled correctly in Sketchup, so it is 22 cm long. But when it passes from Sketchup to Meshlab to Netfabb to Makerware, it becomes 8.7 mm long. That's not a problem in Makerware because it lets you enter an absolute dimension. So I make it 22 cm long and all is good. This happens with other models too. I don't know what I would do without Makerware's ability to apply an absolute dimension. I can send you the model in another format, but I don't know what you can use (Sketchup [skp], Collada [dae], Makerware [thing]) or whether it would help.
