Thank you for the good feedback Jeff. It was great to have you as mentor during this summer. Your responsiveness was marvelous, your answers very helpful and you always brought in ideas that pushed me in the right direction. So thank you again!

Thanks for pointing out these steps. I'm looking forward to complete them.

Regarding the outreach: one could drop a message about WebJack in the Gitter channels of Firmata or Jonny-Five. And maybe writing a tutorial on Instructables would be good for promotion.
