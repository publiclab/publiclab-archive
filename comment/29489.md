Hi all- 
Update for this week, I have been working on continuing programming the stepper motor. I am trying to control the stop and start function so that when I am working with the camera slider, I will be able to make the camera stop at each plate to take a picture and then move forward to the next plate to take a picture. So far I have found out that I may need to use the millis function which I have never worked with before. I found this instructable that may be helpful so I will continue playing around with this!
This is the link to the instructable I am currently looking at!
