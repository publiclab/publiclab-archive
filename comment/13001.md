Thanks [@warren](/profile/warren) re: Semver -- that looks like just the sort of guidance I was looking for!

[@tonyc](/profile/tonyc) -- I was thinking about this issue ... one of the approaches I've seen generally is to simply leave a + and - terminal with a standard 0.1 " header spacing somewhere on the board.  This allows for either a) soldering battery container wires there directly, b) soldering a wire that goes to a JST connector, or a female barrel jack connector, and then to a standard JST wire / barrel jack wire connected to a battery or battery holder, c) soldering a 3.5 mm standard screw terminal there, d) soldering a female or a male header there ... etc.  So then, if we're shipping a flat kit, we can simply include whatever of those options we find most convenient / accessible -- and folks can choose their own alternatives if they like.  (Re: requiring soldering -- we'll anyway likely be requiring the user to do a little soldering for the 2x7 female header at the board.).  It also makes it easier to fit on the board -- whereas choosing a barrel jack or a JST connector would sort of be bulky ... 

Whaddya think?
