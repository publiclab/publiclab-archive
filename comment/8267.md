Hi,
I am glad to hear that you are interested in the project.  The first integrated circuit (IC1) is a quad operational amplifier.  The part number is LMV324IDR.  IC2 is a digital potentiometer (MCP4231-103E/SL).  All the resistors and capacitors are 1206 packages.  All resistances and capacitances in the pdf schematic look OK, but we have changed the values of R8 and R9.  They were 160 K ohm, but we are now using 10 K ohm.  The software on the GitHub site is outdated and I need to update it.  Hope to have time to do that soon.
We may be making a production run in the next few months.  This would be boards populated with components but not headers or leads for the electrodes.  If things work out, we will make 120 boards and I will be able to let you have one for my cost plus shipping.
Let me know if there is anything further that I can help with.
Jack
