Hello Warren.
I never measure the boot time but it boots fast, I can login via ssh after 1 minute or so. And it take a couple of minutes before my drone takes of. The boot time is not problem for me, I keep the camera running. With the current lipo battery it can run for hours. I was thinking to go the pi way but than I need two pi. I need to keep the setup light for my drone. So I went he BBB cap direction. And you can make the cape as custom as you want :). This project has two phases. A NDVI cape and a multi spectraal cap with 4 cameras on it with different filters to calculate other indexes. But as I said allot of coding to do. Need to have the prototype finished before May. Have some farmers who want to use it this growing season.
