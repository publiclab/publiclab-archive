Hey, really excited to see this proposal !!!
Couple of pointers: 

1. I want you to research if there is any external library that helps us achieve this in more simple way.
2. The graph color conversion for less ink consumption is excellent.
3. Do you think we can make some predefined CSS classes with easy names like [@HideLeftColumn](/profile/HideLeftColumn) , [@HideAllVideos](/profile/HideAllVideos), etc. and use them where ever we need?
4. The testing will be a little tricky and i would love to see your strategy in your proposal. 

Very exciting! Thanks ðŸ˜ƒ !
