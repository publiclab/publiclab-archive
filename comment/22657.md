I just laser cut the parts for this (using this file https://hackteria.org/wiki/images/2/24/MicroscopyStage_Laser.pdf) , so I'll let you know how it is to actually build but I found some documentation with a stepwise approach to building it (https://hackteria.org/wiki/images/8/8a/Hackteria_Microscopy_Stage1_Landolt_Stefan.pdf) !
