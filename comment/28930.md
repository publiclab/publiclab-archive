Thank you for the kind welcome! And yes of course, here's the official [ESW link](https://www.eswglobal.org/), and i was part of the [UC Berkeley Chapter](https://esw.berkeley.edu/).  There's also another organization called [Engineering for Change](https://www.engineeringforchange.org/) that does something similar, but with a broader focus beyond sustainability.
