If using an instrument like a hunter colorimeter, be careful.  There is the Hunter L,a,b scale.  Then there is the cie L*,a*,b* scale. Most instruments will calibrate to either scale, so its just making sure you have the right one.  And there are many different illuminants (to simulate the different kinds of light the products might be exposed to).  One illuminant is for daylight, another for flourescent lights,  etc. And usually , there are some special scales.  The YI scale(yellowness index) was one commonly used in plastics. It was used to show how much a clear plastic plastic had degraded.
