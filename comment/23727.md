[@warren](/profile/warren) I have incorporated some views on adding first-timer issues [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/aashnaaashna/04-03-2019/soc-proposal-image-sequencer?_=1554587304#Part+5+:+Scope+for+new+Contributors) and have made Code Climate at the earliest week along with UI testing [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/aashnaaashna/04-03-2019/soc-proposal-image-sequencer?_=1554587304#Week+1+(May+27+-+June+2)). Please let me know of any other refinements to make this better !! Thanks a lot
