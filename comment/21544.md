Here’s my try at this experiment.  Basically, Yes, you can detect added sugar in wine, but it’s a very small change, and requires an accurate baseline.  The difference in absorbance is more than can be accounted for by the presence of sugar.  Possibly an interaction between the sugar and the wine (fermentation?)

Plotting the absorbance from the original data, s1 vs s7 (A = log10(s1/s7)), gives this:

The peak absorbance of 0.15 Au seems kind of high, especially since the path length is only 0.25 cm (15 ml liquid in 90 mm dish).  Multiply that by 4 to get the standard 1 cm path length gives an absorbance of 0.60, with a sugar concentration of approximately 0.3 mole/liter = (7 teaspoons/250 ml) * (4 grams/teaspoon)  * ( 1000 ml/liter) * (mole/342.2 grams).  Compare that to this chart of sucrose absorbance at 1 cm path length:

Using WebPlotDigitizer (https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/) to extract data from the above graph, gives approximately 0.004 absorbance for 0.25 mol/l sucrose at 500 nm.  So it’s not just the sugar causing the observed absorbance.  Maybe there’s a reaction of some kind between the wine and sugar?


The goals for this experiment:

    • remove noise from spectrometer
    • verify 0.3 mole/liter sucrose absorbance
    • measure cabernet/sucrose absorbance




<h2>Setup</h2>

[![setup.JPG](/i/28428)](/i/28428)

Using an old Kodak Condenser Head enlarger to contain the light source and control the amount of light reaching the spectrometer.  For this experiment, I used a piece of tissue paper in the film carrier and removed the object lens.

Samples are placed in plastic boxes:  5cm x 5cm x 7cm.  Shown with the 5% cabernet sample in place.

PL 3.0 spectrometer with DVD grating.  The components were removed from the box and attached to magnets, placed on metal sheet and positioned for correct alignment and focus.  Never could get things to line up properly using the box.





<h2>Remove Noise</h2>

For the software, I’m using  Python with the Pygame library.  The program reads from the spectrometer camera, processes the image, and outputs the spectrum intensity CSV file and a reference image.  SpectralWorkbench is not used.

To remove noise, I’m using two kinds of averaging.  The first, Frame Averaging, reads the spectrum cross-section from a number of frames and outputs the average intensity.  Here’s the result of a 50-frame average:

The second is Row Averaging.  Instead of just reading a single row of pixels at the cross-section, it averages together a number of rows on either side. The average cross-section is then used by the frame averaging and output to the CSV file.  Currently averaging 20 rows on either side of the cross-section.

The rows between the red lines are averaged to become the ‘cross-section’:

[![rowAverage-spectrum-20181218-112614.jpg](/i/28430)](/i/28430)

Camera resolution was increased from the default 640x480 used by SpectralWorkbench, to 1280x720.  The PL 3.0 camera also supports 1600x1200, but the processing time was much slower.

<h2>Verify Sucrose Absorbance</h2>

Using this configuration:  
40 row average; 30 frame average; 2700K LED
Base:  reverse-osmosis water, 5 cm path length
Solution: reverse-osmosis water + 0.3 mole/liter sucrose (19g/180ml); 5 cm path length
 gives this result:

[![water-waterSugar2.png](/i/28431)](/i/28431)

Measured value is approximately 0.025.  Dividing by 5 to get 1 cm path length, gives 0.005, very close to the value in the sucrose absorbance chart.  The spectrometer is able to accurately measure sucrose absorbance, with very little noise.





<h2>Measure Cabernet/Sucrose Absorbance</h2>

Couldn’t find the “Gallo Family Cabernet Sauvignon” locally, so instead used “Double Dog Dare Cabernet Sauvignon”.  The cabernet is much too dark to use with a 5 cm path length, so I made a 5% solution, giving an effective path length of 0.25 cm, same as the original experiment.  For the sugar, I kept the concentration at 0.3 mol/liter, rather than diluting it to 5%.  If the absorbance is only caused by the presence of sugar, this will allow a direct comparison with the water/sugar results.  

Using this configuration:
40 row average; 30 frame average; 2700K LED
Base: Cabernet, 5%; 5cm path length
Solution: Cabernet, 5% + 0.3 mole/liter sucrose (19g/180ml); 5 cm path length
gives this result:


[![cabernet-cabernetSugar2.png](/i/28432)](/i/28432)

Measured value is approximately 0.06, more than twice the absorbance of the 0.3 mol/liter sucrose.
Evidently, there’s some reaction between the cabernet and sucrose that’s contributing to the absorbance. 

“The fermentation process generally stops on its own when there is no sugar left, so you will have a really dry wine, or when the alcohol concentration reaches about 14-18%, depending on the yeast strain.”

I wonder if the extra sugar is interacting with the yeast in the wine…
