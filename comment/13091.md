Wow, your scans look really awesome and consistent! the 20x50 less so, but still good. Why do you think the 20w50 varied more? Are all of those area-equalized?

We made a decision to force the user to explicitly choose the calibration each time, because some were just clicking "Save" without checking the calibration. Maybe we could have a "Same as last scan" button which you do have to specifically click, so it's explicit, and you can't overlook it?

you mean the height? I'm not sure that's necessary, if you do?
