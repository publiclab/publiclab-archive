Thanks for the tip about cheaper SD card modules and RTC modules. I see now how you made your pro-mini logger for $13.00. 

One of those sensors I listed (BMP180) says it runs only at 3.3v, so I guess that will not work with the UNO. The others say something like 3.3 - 5.2v so they should be good.

I think I am getting the picture that the challenge in building a logger is power management, especially sleeping. So far I have noticed three different projects succeeding in this:

- The Cave Pearl based on an Arduino Pro-mini  
- The [Riffle](https://publiclab.org/wiki/riffle) based on a custom board with an Atmel328p  
- The [Dead_Bug_Prototypes shield](https://www.tindie.com/products/Dead_Bug_Prototypes/extreme-low-power-data-logging-shield-for-arduino/) for an Arduino UNO

I'm curious about how these approaches differ. I assume the Pro-mini does not have the UART chip that makes it so hard to sleep the UNO. But the Dead_Bugs_Prototypes logger is based on a UNO and claims to last for months on a 9v battery. I guess [@donblair](/profile/donblair) avoided the UART chip on the Riffle? Again, I'm just curious about this because it seems to be quite an art to make an Arduino-based logger last more than a couple of weeks. 

Here is an updated list of potential components for the educational build of the Cave Pearl logger ($12.00 without wire or sensors): 

Arduino Uno clone $3.61 http://www.ebay.com/itm/161863547083

Breadboard $1.50 http://www.ebay.com/itm/181711836632?_trksid=p2055119.m1438.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT

SD card module $0.99 http://www.ebay.com/itm/131132034753

Real time clock module $0.99 http://www.ebay.com/itm/251401815796

LEDs 20 for $1.67 http://www.ebay.com/itm/301726745400

2 GB micro SD card $2.79 http://www.ebay.com/itm/381450686867?var=650599379406

10 colors of 24 AWG solid wire $14.97 http://www.ebay.com/itm/271939281212

Also need a resistor or two.

These sensors seem to run on either 3.3 or 5 volts:

AM2301 DHT21 humidity and temperature sensor $3.41 http://www.ebay.com/itm/301410138124

Adafruit MCP9808 temperature sensor $6.68 http://www.ebay.com/itm/161886933708 (not from overseas, but much cheaper shipping than from Adafruit)

Very fun,  
Chris
