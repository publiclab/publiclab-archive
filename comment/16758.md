Dear Chris, 
                 Thank you so much for your reply. So the accuracy relies on the custom white balance settings. I found one interesting paper which applied mobius modified infragram from  public labs ( Wratten 25 A filter), if interested you can have a look.However not much focus on the validation part has been presented. 
 Also, Is there any way you suggest that we could find  the exact spectral response of the filter?

Best Regards,
