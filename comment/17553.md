Another thing that makes tag pages sort of mysterious is that you can get to one by searching for "https://publiclab.org/tag/balloon-mapping", but if you enter "balloon-mapping" in the publiclab search box (https://publiclab.org/search/balloon-mapping) you don't get a tag page, and the search results you get are rather unhelpful. Apparently search does not include tags. There are two things about the user experience at publiclab that seem strange, and one of them is that search doesn't seem to work like I expect it to.
