Ah, Arduino. Those DS3231 RTCs are designed to be used with a rechargeable coin cell (LIR2032) and they trickle current into the battery when current is supplied. Ed Mallon's standard procedure is to remove the 201 resistor (flip it off with a soldering iron) and use a non-rechargeable coin cell (CR2032).

*Remove the resistor on the right to disable trickle charging of the coin cell. Removing the one on the left disables the LED.*

Ed Mallon typically uses these with 3.3v Pro Minis, but he [also uses them with 5v Unos](https://thecavepearlproject.org/2015/12/22/arduino-uno-based-data-logger-with-no-soldering/). He has not reported any problems running them at 5v. I have used one of these RTCs with a 5v Nano without issue, and I was powering the Nano with a 9v battery. But that is not to say that the coin cell will not explode the next time I power it on. 

I don't remember if the RTCs I sent to Dave had the resistors removed or not. Now I always remove them before including an RTC in a kit. 

Dave is correct that a 5v sensor cannot be run from a 3v Pro Mini (without fancy mods), so the Pro Mini might be the wrong platform. However, your 5v Pro Minis could work if the RTC will tolerate 5v. Although the Arduino Forum posts suggest that those RTCs will not tolerate 5v, Ed Mallon suggests they work at either 3.3v or 5v. 

You might be able to use a 5v Nano which conveniently has a 3.3v output pin (VCC is 5v), so you can power modules which need either voltage. But Nanos use a lot of battery power and will not last long in the field.

I have used those RTCs without removing the resistor for deployments of many weeks without issue. I was powering them at 3.3v, not 5v, but the trickle current into the CR2032 coin cell did not explode it. So there seems to be a lot of variability in how those RTC behave.

So there are multiple solutions depending on your requirements for battery life and whether you want to test your faith in the 5v tolerance of those RTCs or wait to get another type of RTC.
