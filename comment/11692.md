Mathew:  The "super simple" flow meter you linked to is what DavidMack was describing in the first post comment.  That is real good to calibrate a meter or measure a small volume and not so good to control a flow rate by.  

Luc L. and I did some brainstorming this evening at the Picayune Make meeting.  We went over all the ideas I had and he came up with some more.  The least expensive and practical we ended up with was a manometer attached to two tees with a needle valve (or similar) between the two tees.  You essentially end up with this configuration: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_measurement#Orifice_plate   The way you operate it is to place some colored water in the manometer (U shaped tube) and move the measuring stick so the 0 is on the meniscus.  After you prepare and attach the formaldehyde tube you turn on the vacuum pump and adjust the valve so the meniscus is at the previously calibrated 0.3 lpm value.  When you are done with the measurement you disconnect the manometer and plug both ends so that the water does not leak in the shipping container.
