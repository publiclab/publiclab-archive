Hi [@stevie](/profile/stevie)! 

Thank you for your suggestions, let me know what you think about the current design (https://edieblu.github.io/pl-welcome.io/). Is it straightforward enough? Is the open call featured enough? Do you think it would help if we added icons to the 4 calls to action? 

Kind regards, 
Eva
