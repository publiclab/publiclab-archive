Using a Pi cam and some optics from alibaba that runs about $20, you can get sub-micron quality. This image made with a waterscope, or Open Flexure Microscope, one of the super awesome projects we found at GOSH.

This is what inspired me to mess around with the Mobius. Richard, the inventor, is going to post some stuff soon, and we should see more on his project as [@mathew](/profile/mathew) starts using it for the dust monitoring project.

All very exciting.
