Hi [@warren](/profile/warren) , [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano) !
Great ideas here on this page :)

With reference to this comment [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/sagarpreet/02-16-2018/social-media-integration-and-part-of-interactive-project-maps#c18720) . 

How about in the View of E-mail of a node , we can add an option to `reply with tweet` if and only if that node has powertag `twitter:XXXXX` . 
On clicking this button we link the user to the tweet : `https://twitter.com/PublicLab/status/XXXXX` and then user can reply on this tweet and it would be visible on PL site  . 

What do you think ? Thanks !
