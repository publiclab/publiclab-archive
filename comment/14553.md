But that was part of my point -- the camera does 'raw-capture' processing on the sensor's 12-14bit detector data before it gives you the 'raw' data file -- so even though you could discover the RGGB pattern correlation and find the 'typical' sensor sensitivity curves, you can never really know the pixel sensor bin data. But agreed, that is a technical detail -- nobody actually wants the true hardware data as you'd have to perform all that additional processing outside and without the knowledge of the maker of the camera and chips. So, right, DSLR "raw" data really is better even with the camera's internal pre-processing; though gain correction would still be required as the 'raw' data is not linear or flat over wavelength; but the 12-14bits help.
