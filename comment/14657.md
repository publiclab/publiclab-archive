Wow, great start though! One thought for debugging is to record as an audio file the output from a known source (softmodem or the fsk generator) and play it into your phone -- there are things to possibly watch out for on cable type, android vs. iOS (reading into iOS probably won't work at all, as apple hasn't implemented or allowed WebRTC). 

Great!
