Without a "reference standard" the measurements will all be relative; not absolute (like ppm [parts per mission]). So, the relative concentration would be roughly linearly related to the value of the 'peak' in the spectrum for the color associated with the pigment color.

Making such measurements is dependent on 1) having a mechnically stable setup where nothing changes except a single factor (the pigmented fluid), 2) a broad-spectrum light source (not a CFL but at least an incandescent; halogen can be better (Solux 4700K Halogen is 'ideal') so the spectrum isn't dramatically distorted by the light source and 3) setting the system to have a max (but non-clipped) response at the pigment color using clear water as a 'max response' reference (i.e. zero concentration).  [Note, however, if ALL of your samples have significant color concentration that reduces the signal, then you might substitute the 'lightest'/'clearest' sample as a 'reference'.] [Also: the reverse can work as well -- with the 'darkest'/'highest concentration' as the reference where all other samples are more dilute..]

One of the measurement issues is the limited dynamic range of the typical PLab spectrometer. You must keep the 'brightest' signal from clipping and the 'dimmest'(most concentrated) from dropping down into the noise where measurement values become very difficult to read. You will have to adjust the light source distance (thus intensity) while trying samples to find the best setup.

Given all of that, the concentration is 'roughly'(for this device) linearly related to the measured value at the color (wavelength) associated with the pigment color. A good test is to start with red food coloring and water. If you measure the peak 'red' wavelength spectral value at 100 and then dilute by 50%, the new spectral value at the same wavelength would double (200) because the concentration dropped by half so twice as much light can get through. By extension, a 1000:1 dilution would be essentially clear (but it might then clip the signal due to the dynamic range limit) and pure food coloring might drop the signal into the noise where it is too dark to measure. So, within the measurement range and simple setup limits concentration and signal have a simple relationship. If you needed to "extend the dynamic range" you could do so using dilution to establish an intermediate reference, but that's an additional kettle of fish.
