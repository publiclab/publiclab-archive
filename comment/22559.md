Abstract:

The location of inhaled dust in the respiratory tract was examined in three subjects. India-ink (8046524) (mean size 0.1 micron), iron-oxide (1309371) dust, aluminum (7429905) powder, and calcium-carbonate (471341) (mean size 0.2 microns) were inhaled in a mixing chamber for at least 2 minutes at rates of 3, 10, and 32 per minute. Exhaled air was collected as global expired air, end of tidal air, and alveolar air. Numbering and measurement of dust particles were carried out using electron microscope enlarged photograph after sampling. The deposition of particles (except for the deep pulmonary regions) varied inversely with the respiratory rate, with alveolar deposition accounting for 90 percent of the particles. Alveolar air was similar to that expired at the end of tidal air. The maximum size for particles found in deep alveolar air was approximately 1 micron, with decreased deposition below 0.5 microns, with no minimum. These factors were constant at all concentrations of inhaled air. The minimum retention sizes for global expired air and end tidal air were 0.25 microns. The authors conclude that there may or may not be a minimum retention size of these dusts; that there appears to be a minimum of 0.25 microns in global and end tidal air, but not in alveolar air, where 90 percent of the dust is deposited.

Abstract:

The effects of inhaled dust particles and carbachol (51832) aerosol on the mechanical characteristics of the lungs were studied in human subjects. The effects of a sympathomimetic aerosol were also investigated. This sympathomimetic drug was a mixture of isoproterenol (7683592), cyclopentamine (102454), and procaine (59461) in 80 percent propylene-glycol (57556). Dust particles were coal dust, activated charcoal, India-ink (8046524), calcium-carbonate (471341), and aluminum (7429905). Physiological measurements were recorded before dust inhalation, after breathing carbachol or dust, after a period allowed for spontaneous recovery, after breathing the sympathomimetic aerosol, and after rebreathing carbachol or dust. Lung compliance, pulmonary resistance, airway and tissue resistance, and thoracic gas volume were measured. Airway resistance increased in most subjects following inhalation of carbachol or dust particles (particularly coal and aluminum dusts). In several cases, airway resistance was doubled following inhalation of aluminum dust. Inhalation of saline or water aerosols did not produce this response. There was some spontaneous decrease in resistance with time, complete remission after sympathomimetic aerosol inhalation, and very little effect from inhalation of dust following the sympathomimetic aerosol. Pulmonary resistance was also reduced and a slight decrease in lung compliance was demonstrated in some cases. Changes in tissue volume were slight and inconsistent in direction. The authors conclude that the pattern of airway resistance response was sufficiently uniform to indicate that the various agents tested act by a common but unidentified physiological mechanism.

Abstract:

The effects of intratracheally administered coarse mode particles on respiratory tract infections were investigated in mice. Female CD1-mice received intratracheal injections of solutions containing 10, 33, and 100 micrograms (microg) of ferric-oxide (1309371), calcium-carbonate (471341), quartz (14808607), and sodium-feldspar. The streptococcus infectivity model system was used to determine the effect of exposures on susceptibility to respiratory infection. After the challenge, mice were removed and deaths were recorded daily over a 14 day observation period. Exposed mice simultaneously inhaled aerosols of klebsiella-pneumoniae; the ratio of viable bacterial counts to radioactive counts in each animal's lungs provided the rate at which bacteria were destroyed 3 hours after infection. Mortality in mice challenged with streptococcal aerosol within 1 hour after the intratracheal injection of the particle suspensions showed a significant overall increase for each treatment group. Ferric-oxide was the only treatment that had an effect at 10microg per mouse. A dose of 33microg per mouse was needed to significantly enhance mortality. With calcium-carbonate and sodium-feldspar, mortality continued to increase with increasing concentration, whereas for ferric-oxide and quartz a response plateau was observed. The authors conclude that ferric-oxide, calcium-carbonate, and sodium-feldspar have effects roughly equivalent to quartz.

Abstract:

Acute eosinophilic pneumonia, which was described in 1989, is thought to represent a hypersensitivity reaction to unidentified inhaled antigens. Here, we present a case of a marble mine worker with acute eosinophilic pneumonia complicated with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
