Okay, here's my interpretation of the more advanced circuit:

Full schematic:

[![riffle-beta-0.1.5.0-schematic.png](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/796/medium/riffle-beta-0.1.5.0-schematic.png)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/796/original/riffle-beta-0.1.5.0-schematic.png)

Close-up on the relevant power circuitry:

- Load balancing is accomplished between USB and the Lithium battery, culminating in the "VDD" line going into a switch.  Connecting VDD to the LDO, either USB, the lithium battery, or both can be plugged in, and power to the LDO via LDD will be robust.  Also, the dynamics of lithium battery charging will be enhanced (as described in the above-referenced blog post).  I need to choose a suitable value of R11 -- it was chosen as 100K in the blog post, but I need to go through the calculation for our case (depends on the characteristics of e.g. the diode we're using as D3, I think). 

- The switch switches between VDD (USB/Lithium) and VGEN1.  VGEN1 connects to two possible power inputs -- a JST connector, or two breakout pins (+, -) on the board.  There is currently no diode protection on either -- so it will be important not to plug in a power source into both inputs simultaneously.  We might decide to include parallel diodes on these two input lines, so that each source is protected against the other; the downside of doing so would be the associated forward diode voltage drop.  It might be nice to leave the diodes off so that folks who want to connect custom power boards that produce a voltage close to 3.3V don't have to deal with the forward voltage drop; and I'm imagining that it's unlikely that people will want to / try to plug in power to both of these sources at once.  

... but what do y'all think -- is it better to be fully protected, with diodes?
