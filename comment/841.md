Hi Mat, a couple of software developers from an opensource mapping project Rhus are going to try out your detection approach and mapping the results onto an image map like this one:

http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/deepwinter/6-5-2012/rhus-open-source-mobile-gis-community-ecology

http://publiclaboratory.org/map/mission-dolores-park-san-francisco/2012-05-12

The plan is to map images of strip and tube locations, along with the results.  They are also interested in developing computer vision software that will record and estimate the concentration of H2S based on the strip color.

I thought you might find their work interesting--we're at the very early stages but we're going to be documenting and planning the experiments here:

Any advice you have would certainly be welcome!

Hope all is well
