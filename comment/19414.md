Hi [@kinasmith](/profile/kinasmith) this is extremely helpful! I have some additional information to report: the HCHO meter has already been sent to the research site in Georgia, whereas Nick and Leslie are in Philly. Do you have a phone number we could call and kind of talk through the feasibility of setting this up in advance if we don't have the actual sensor to work with? Â°_0
