It's been a while so I thought I would post a project update to Public Lab

1) We had another successful fieldwork season, marking the deployment of the third generation of Cave Pearls, including a new "dry" cave model for sensing drip water in caves:

All of the beta generation survived five months under water (Woot!, a full data set!), so we reloaded them with fresh batteries and threw them in the ocean! We are making contacts now with other researchers, and are hoping to calibrate to true point velocity calibration by codeployments with commercial sensors (preferably acoustic Doppler) with the next set of installations around the end of the year.

2) I have updated the DIY datalogger by adding one more component:

I have the component cost down to about $15 for the core logging platform. This new design gracefully powers down when the batteries go low, protecting the data. Most of my builds sleep around 0.5-0.6 mA (with an ADXL345 sensor attached) so I am pretty confident that the design will run for about a year on 3x AA batteries IF you have a real BrandName SD card (fakes don't go into low current sleep-mode properly - there are posts about that on the blog if you are interested). I have also included links to all the parts, so anyone who wants to can whip one up. Bread-boarding these takes about an hour, and my current build time for a complete drip sensor is about 4 hours (course by now I have had a fair bit of practice, YMMV :-)

P.S. 
The way I have setup the blog, if you click the links that say  ---click here to continue reading the story---  it jumps you to the next narrative post, skipping over the technical updates. I had to do this because a fair number of people were complaining that they did not no how to navigate my "website".  After trying to explain what a blog was so many times, I just gave up, and that was my solution. If you actually want all the gory technical details, use the blog navigation at the top of each post. There is much more content to read that way.
