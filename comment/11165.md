Yes the pictures are of the botanical garden, it is my favourite testing ground since it has all difficult terrain aspects condensed into a small area.
About the details of the sensor i will share when i am done. for now i will just post results occaisionaly.
I was planningto do it weekly but i see no interest in the database.
