This does look like raw imagery from our (Event 38's) NGB modified cameras. We use custom made filter glass to get the best separation possible between infrared and visible channels... I can't be sure but I think this imagery appears a little more vibrant than usual because of the late day lighting conditions with the sun almost at the horizon. Attached is a sample of how they look with more even lighting conditions.

If you're going to fly again, I would suggest trying the latest CHDK and KAP_LUA script which has excellent control over the shutter speed and metering settings. 1/1600th of a second is enough to get rid of motion blur in the majority of conditions. I'm very glad to see the cameras being put to good use, keep up the good work!
