Hi Pat,
The Wratten 25A is an old standard photographic filter that is still widely available in glass and gel. I think Ned bought a genuine Kodak 3" square gel on eBay for ~$10. That product was discontinued in 2008, but it is still available for some reason. I guess it's main use was in black and white film photography, and there a lot of them searching for a new role in life. Other manufacturers make equivalents.

It is also possible to use a [Rosco filter like this one](http://rosco.com/filters/SED.cfm?titleName=C2001:%20VS%20Red&imageName=../images/filters/cinegel/2001.jpg). The spectral qualities will not be the same, and will be somewhat unknown. I don't know how reliable Rosco's spectral graphs are, but I have noticed that some of their graphs are used for more than one filter. If the pure NIR channel produced by the Wratten 25A is responsible for some of its advantages over the BG3, those advantages could be lost if a Rosco filter is used.
