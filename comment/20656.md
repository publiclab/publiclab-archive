For [Early Bird and Intro kits](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/the-community-microscope-kit/posts/2286741), we ultimately got a slightly different model of webcam -- it has a retracting cable, and an extra screw when compared to the originals in the tutorial above. Note that if you're getting a laser cut acrylic stage, this won't be an issue. 

What we've found is that the cable is **easy to shift** [when converting the webcam](https://publiclab.org/notes/bronwen/05-07-2018/microscope-webcam-conversion), and **this is good**. The new webcams also still pass right through the slot (shown below) so your cable can neatly come out the bottom of the microscope.  

However, if you don't want to mess with the cable, you can ALSO punch a small hole as shown in the image below, expanding the slot where the webcam clip goes, and the cable will go right out that hole. If you don't have a hole punch as big as ours, you can also just cut a groove using scissors or a box knife -- but be careful!

We're very happy that we were able to offer already-cut holes in this kit rather than just blank coroplast, as it's allowed us to print instructions on the stages. But the holes vary in quality, and we'll probably move to a die-cut soon, instead of a sign cutter (kudos to [@mathew](/profile/mathew) for this idea!). If you've gotten a set of REALLY BAD holes, send us a photo and we can replace it. But we're making sure they're all usable. 

How have people been doing assembling their microscopes? Chime in and share your photos here!

We'll also be offering the laser-cut stages as an upgrade kit if you really find you want a bit more rigidity. Stay tuned!
