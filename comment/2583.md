I don't think I get same back and forth movement you were getting because my wind fins are much lighter, made from strips of the bottle and not the thick bottom, but I still get a little.  the second line you added seems to make a big difference though. I like it!

I'll try adding another point to my standard rig, right now I use  two loops around the neck of the bottle, one at the front of the neck and one at the back.  Two is much, much better than one.  They are looped all the way around the neck, and then held in place with a rubber band so they don't slide around (picture below)

Inside the bottle, I use four rubber bands on the harness to hold the camera in place-- but I'm using a soda bottle, your Ocean Spray bottle aligns the camera to that little ridge, and you don't need as much pressure to hold it in place.  I really think the rubber bands around the camera are a lot nicer than tape and string-- no tape residue, and extra shock protection.
