The thermister in use has a Thermal time constant <= 15 seconds, which is fine for some applications. 
However, to get a faster measurement, a different sensor is recommended, like a DS18B20 Digital temperature sensor , for which Query time is less than 750ms. That's about 20 times faster, and it's still under $10.
