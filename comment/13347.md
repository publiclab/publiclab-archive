A. "visually differentiate between the five (5) test samples" - here, you mean based on qualitative visual inspection of the graphs, right? Do you believe the gain correction is absolutely needed for this? Just curious.

B. We've discussed ([@gretchen](/profile/gretchen), can you help me with a link?) using an area-based measure for curve centering, for comparisons. Do you think this'd be equally, more, or less affected by some of the peak shifting effects you describe? Are there other measures of center position that might perform better?

C. Laser eye safety is of course a high concern for us, and is part of what's motivated some of [@tonyc](/profile/tonyc) and my explorations into LED-based fluorescence, along with very tight control of the input light source brightness (with a dial!). Any thoughts on the viability of this method, esp. as it also reduces the # of parts which must be aligned, and increases rigidity enormously (and removes the need to align a beam path, for the most part)? https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-05-2016/testing-high-brightness-405nm-leds-in-fluorescence-spectroscopy-of-oils
