Sounds like gel filters would be tricky at best, so I guess ixnay to that.

How about this one?

It has less transmittance than the impressive looking specimen you posted above, but a narrower bandwidth.  Speaking of which, for NDVI purposes, exactly what nanometer range would we ideally want the bandpass filters to pass?  Where's the sweet spot?  I'm not sure what the preferred target is.

Here's a couple different IR bandpass filters that pass different segments of near-IR:

I think I see why this is tricky.  To lower cost, you need to settle for a smaller filter.  But I assume that means a smaller aperture camera (?), so the amount of light collected goes down.  So you need a really *bright* sunny day, or your camera may not register much, and probably your pixel resolution goes down too.  Not knowing enough about cameras, I'm afraid I'm already over my head, as I have no good intuition as to how well or poorly this will pan out.
