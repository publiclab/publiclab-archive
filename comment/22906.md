GitHub lists 7 projects: https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=toxics+release+inventory&type=

But the EPA site seems only to offer JSON for UV index, which i guess means how likely you'll get a sunburn? https://www.epa.gov/enviro/web-services#uvrest

Data.gov shows a REST API which is a bit more helpful, i think:
