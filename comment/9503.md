[@dorncox](/profile/dorncox) and I "riffed" on this idea today in Somerville... can we call it the Riffle Cricket, maybe, referencing that cricket chirps encode the air temperature?

Dorn and I also talked about the potential to put a small solar panel on this and maybe somehow get it to store power until it has enough to "chirp".
