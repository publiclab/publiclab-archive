Hey [@alaxallves](/profile/alaxallves) ,

I studied this proposal and this proposal looks perfect!!! 
Saying that i had a couple of pointers as well from my side for SWB.
But as Jeff said this is not a high priority project right now, i would highly recommend you to work on other projects like Mapknitter exporter system, etc.

I know there is not much time (~7 days) for proposal submission but i would love to see your proposal change, i guess atleast the abstract level of what you are going to solve would be fine and not the coding solution part is required as we have trust on your ability to solve the problem.

Jeff can surely add more on the mapknitter exporter problem to help!

Thanks ðŸ˜ƒ
