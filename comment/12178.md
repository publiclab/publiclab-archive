Thanks, good question Dan. The usual guidance from the KAP community is more distance from the kite to the rig on the line is better, like minimum 60-100', enough so the kite is stable and in clean air before attaching camera rig. I shoot for this when I'm flying my other larger kites, so I'll fiddle with it for this set up as well. I did observe that the little kite seemed pretty skittish, even at altitude. Also when bringing it down, my video didn't capture it, but closer to the ground the kite started spinning - made several revolutions. Pretty scenic.

This was just a test, in the event of a real camera flight, ... :->
