Nice rock photos. This is really a comment on the previous answer, but if you leave comments in the comment place then you can't drag images in. And the following images highlight how crazy it is that you zeroed in on that tiny area of ultramafic bedrock. I knew there was a big serpentine outcrop at Belvidere mountain, but I didn't know there was a itty bitty exposure of it nearer to me.

*Above: This map is the same scale as the one above. There are a few tiny outcrops of ultramafic rock in the White River Valley. It's good to know they are there.*

The story of serpentine is a great cautionary tale of expertise. Geologists have known about serpentine for centuries, but when I was born, nobody knew that it is formed only at seafloor spreading centers which are where plate tectonics is driven by the creation of new crust. Nobody knew because nobody knew that seafloor spreading centers or plate tectonics existed. So the fundamental concepts which now organize the discipline of geology are younger than I am.
