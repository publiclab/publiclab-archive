That "four electrode" system gave me an idea-- what about just using a 1/8" mini jack, one of the "three band" ones with a mic line too, as is now standard on phone headsets?  its a standard part, its coated in nickel (and some of them even in 14k gold!) and it has four electrodes with a standardized spacing, and it comes pre-wired.  If it was waterproof enough, it seems like it would be a perfect part.   There's a nickel-plated one on digikey-- I think it might be possible to screw it through a waterproof housing too: item CP-35401SP-ND.

Now I'm imagining someone walking into your kitchen to find a toaster oven shaking violently. "uh, this is for science!"  On Amazon, there are a series of [$10-20 vibrating](http://www.amazon.com/Idea-Village-Products-MIYASHI-Massaging/dp/B00592QCUG/ref=pd_sim_sbs_auto_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=1S69PGQR8S67FEZEDQZ5), and sometimes heating, lumbar pillows that might be the perfect thing. just strip of the soft part.
