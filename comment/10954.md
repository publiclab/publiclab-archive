Good stuff. From my perspective NDVI is good for mapping vegetation and can provide some indication of overall health and is good at differentiating between vegetated and non-vegetated areas but fluorescence is a better indicator of plant function. The remote sensing community is optimistic that in the next couple years new satellite sensors and algorithms will be able to provide decent estimates of global gross primary productivity (GPP) based on fluorescence measurements. Currently different estimates of global GPP vary by a factor of two. Passive mapping of fluorescence (usually called solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence [SIF] in the remote sensing literature) is not easy since, as the image above illustrates, the signal from fluorescence is very weak and it's difficult to separate that from all of the reflected light.

NDVI can still be useful at close range but it is quite different from coarse resolution satellite images. At close range a single pixel might fall entirely on a leaf but from satellite the pixel is a mix of leaves, branches, soil, shadows.
