Thank you Warren, I will try it out tomorrow. It's bed time here. 

And I promise not to "abuse" this macro. I had just set it to 6 seconds to get a few quick captures for testing purposes and I was observing the progress closely.

This macro will just help me to test the spectrometer quality without interruptions even under the most difficult conditions (i.e. when there is StarWars on tv...)   ;-)
