A DIY spectrometer can be used to characterize the spectral reflectivity of a target if two things are true:

1. The spectrometer must be sensitive in the near infrared region
2. The spectrometer's relative sensitivity in the visible and NIR bands used to compute NDVI must be known.

Neither of these things is true about the Public Lab spectrometer. A spectrometer that uses a camera with known spectral sensitivity in the visible and NIR region (e.g., PowerShot A2200) could be used.
