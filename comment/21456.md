 Some of the the inexpensive conductivity meters used an a.c. Frequency generator feeding a wheatstone bridge.  One leg of the wheatstone was the water solution to be tested.  The "balancing" leg was a potentiometer or a resistor bridge.  The difference between the legs was adjusted to zero with an a.c. Voltmeter (high impedance).  When it read zero, you were there.  Some resistance measurements and math would get you there.  

The wheatstone part is straightforward, but labor intensive.  Using a cheap multimeter would work for the voltmeter.  Maybe use the 555 as the a.c. Freq generator?

Just an idea.
