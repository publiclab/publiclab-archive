I think a laser rangefinder might work well for this. Put it on a pole and point it downward to measure the distance from the rangefinder to the snow surface below ([like I did to measure water depth](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/09-22-2018/who-will-win-in-a-world-of-laser-depths)). The cheap sensors have a range of only one meter, but if that is not enough you can mount a second sensor on the pole two meters above the ground, and so on. A single Arduino can record data from all the sensors. During blizzards the data will be very noisy, but then you also have a record of when it was snowing. Total cost for parts to measure up to 2 m of snow depth for all winter on batteries is about $30.00.
