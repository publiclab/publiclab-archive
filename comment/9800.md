when you write that: "We struggled a great deal with getting enough fluorescent light from the sample to register on the webcams..." were you using one of the setups described here: http://publiclab.org/wiki/oil-testing-kit, or were you taking measurements without enclosing the samples in a lightproof box? Why the variance in the result?
