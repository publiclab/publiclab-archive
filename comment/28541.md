Hi [@17sushmita](/profile/17sushmita) I will review your proposal in detail in a bit but I wanted to point out some of the things you have not included so you can start working on those

- Please add a section for the contributions you have done i.e issues opened, pull requests opened /merged etc.

- It will also be nice to add a "Timeline/Milestones" section which will have a schedule explaining what you will be working on each week.

- I know you have explained the hours you will not be engaged on school work but it would be good to add a commitment column which you will tell us exactly how many hours per week you will be available to work on the project.
-  It would be good to tell us a little bit on your experience and also your passion for the project
-  If there is anything you will need for your proposal to be implemented successful please include that too...
you could refer to this proposal to see some of the sections I have pointed out https://publiclab.org/notes/keshav_sethi0004/03-12-2020/gsoc-2020-proposal-spam-management-dashboard . Thanks
