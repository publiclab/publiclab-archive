Thanks, [@kaustubh_nair](/profile/kaustubh_nair) - this is really great. I also really appreciate all the work and collaboration you've been putting into MapKnitter already üëç üéâ 

Actually the biggest advice I could give is to look through [@souravirus](/profile/souravirus)'s posts and work over the last summer's SoC -- taking the `plots2` project from Rails 3.x to Rails 5.x!

It was a gigantic project, and you can follow the PRs as well:

https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/2927

https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/2798

https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/2726

https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/2533

These may include other upgrades such as further work on Yarn, changing the asset pipeline setup, all kinds of things. Thanks for a great proposal!!!
