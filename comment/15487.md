Yes, exactly! That's what I finally came around to this morning :)  That's the proper level of abstraction here; there are various clever schemes for detecting errors, and they can all be tried out on top of the system as it stands, just as you suggest.

I think there are also much more efficient and robust approaches than the simple "repeat three times and majority vote" approach I'd suggested ... going to post an update later today if I get something working ... 

Fun!
