 Usually gravimetric tests are done on particles after they have been captured in the field.  Given environmental vibrations, it sounds tough to pick up the fall of a particle in the field. 

 In this design, the grating appears to be to create a low-wind zone to hold onto particles once they blow in, as well as keep large particles out.
