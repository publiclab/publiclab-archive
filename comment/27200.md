I did this! Thanks so much, [[@sophied](/profile/sophied)](/profile/sophied) and [[@sashae](/profile/sashae)](/profile/sashae) for this inspiring, thorough yet accessible guide. I've been using the based SDR/dipole antenna you referenced and the process you've outlined below to capture some intriguing satellite imagery this past month. We're in the midst of a heat wave here in the Pacific NW and I've been decoding imagery this week and watching the sea- and ground-surface temperatures varying along the way.

The only thing I will add is that if you opt for the basic V-dipole antenna, I found a few sources elsewhere to help orient the antenna -- from what I've read (and now through experience myself), you can get quite good reception placing the two dipoles 120 degrees apart and extended to 54.5m to achieve the (quarter) resonant length for the roughly 137.5MHz frequency. If you drew a line at the midpoint of the two dipoles (so 60-60 degrees), I have that pointing due South (in the photo below, to the left). The V-shape is parallel to the ground and I use the included tiny flexible tripod.

I've attached a few photos (sorry the resonant length is wrong in my photo!) and with this setup have achieved quite decent signals and SNR between 20-40 when there are no obstructions in the sky, at satellite elevations greater than 40 degrees.

I've also included a few captures from this evening. Thanks again! Looking forward to more from [#open-weather](/tag/open-weather)
