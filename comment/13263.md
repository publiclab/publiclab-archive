Sorry, i was holidazing! Can you upload a pic of your build, so we can help debug? You kind of have to look perpendicular to the grating's surface, but pointing the slit towards a diffuse but bright light source -- like a white wall under a fluorescent light, or the sky -- will help. That way, for starters, you don't have to align things as much.
