I like the direction the rewards are going.  The "whole shooting match" might be unnecessary.  If someone wants two spectrometers, can't they just back the campaign twice?  Maybe fill that price gap with a ready-to-use desktop spectrometer for around $100? But I still have a rather vague idea about what each reward is (assembled vs kit, desktop vs countertop).

I like Mathew's idea of emphasizing that you did the hard design and calibration of a clever and elegant system and now you need backers' help to refine the protocols and find the best uses for the tool.  I think people will respond strongly to the idea that they can own their first spectrometer which is a cutting edge tool with precision measured in NANOMETERS!  But the video images make the spectrometer look a little ratty.  The torn pieces of tape on the webcam and the broken piece of DVD do not match the perception that this is a clever and elegant high-tech system.  Those details should be interpreted as evidence of brilliant hacking, but they might instead weaken people's confidence in the tool.  We know that diffraction does not care about ratty tape, but that is a sophisticated understanding.
