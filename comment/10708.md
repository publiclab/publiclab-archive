There are the little plastic crimp-on things made to protect electrical wire going through holes in metal boxes.
Those come in black and might fill a hole in paper without tearing it up.

Or, perhaps easier, tho' potentially messier and more permanent, there's opaque black silicone caulk/glue stuff used to hold door gaskets in place for automobiles
