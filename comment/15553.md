[@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) when push comes to shove would you want the Kitagawa based system to be an activity for assessing the efficacy of the purifier? in your comment above you note that qualitative measures could be fine, and also our kit was good at reproducing finding in the same place so could be good for assessing change even if the exact ppb quantification is off. That said, I'm pretty wary of asking anyone to make that kit on their own as it is super time intensive if you use the bubble flow meter and somewhat expensive if you use the rotometer, and as we should have something much better and cheaper in 6 months i have a bit of extra hesitancy. So I'm on the fence erring towards lets wait till we see what we can do with this current NSF project (that i need to announce-- oops!)
