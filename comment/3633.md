Very cool to see the noise reduction graphed properly. Do you think the remaining "wobbliness" in the line is due in part to the spectrum itself (I'd guess not -- black body spectrum, right?) or to some kind of systematic noise (how the slit is cut, reflections, unevenness in the black interior of the chamber, other issues with the camera?)

I was thinking of how to describe this sort of smoothing -- if we made a macro, would we call it "auto-smoothing"?
