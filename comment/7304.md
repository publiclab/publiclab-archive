Hi dckim. One may get sharper and bright images by reducing the slit width (by cutting a narrower slit in a new black card) but then you loose brightness rapidly if the light source is not right in front of the spectrometer slit. Theoretically the diffraction signal -proportional to the entering intensity times sine(width)/width to the square- will reach a peak in sharpness reducing the slit width but the light entering the slit reduces and the overall spectrum intensity drops, the area of the slit is reduced so the amount of light passing through it.
