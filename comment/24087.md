 Hi [@warren](/profile/warren)
I saw your comment in one of the slides regarding blue buttons everywhere.
How about keeping blue for primary and main buttons but for other features like tags and all, we can have many more great combinations.
I tried this in one of my PR. And this looks great

Bootstrap has many button color classes, we can try them.
