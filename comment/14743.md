This is so fantastic.  So neat to see the current spikes with the SD card writes!

ANd ... oh, my, what a terribly high sleeping current ...  

I should definitely do the math soon and add up the nominal quiescent power draw of all of the other chips on the board in addition to the 328p.  The LDO and the additional eeprom will be part of the tally ... as will the SHT-21.  I don't expect they'd should require as much as a millivolt altogether, though.  There is some question as to whether the LDO part is properly chosen -- there might be a lower-power version of the same package that could be swapped in.

I somehow suspect that the SD card itself might be responsible for a lot of power consumption while sleeping.  [Edward Mallon](https://edwardmallon.wordpress.com/about/about-me/) has done a lot of [great research](https://edwardmallon.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/high-sleep-current-problem-solved/) into this, and the power draw seems to depend on the SD card manufacturer.  He also found some trick around pulling up the MISO MOSI SCK lines (if I recall) when the device was asleep.

Maybe one simple thing to do, in order to see how much the SD card is contributing (even when not writing), would be to modify the sketch so that skips the write part ... and then remove the SD card ... and let the device sleep, and measure the current then?  One could also try an SD card from another manufacturer ...

Bravo on this elegant setup.  Really helpful to see this process laid out so nicely.
