1. Interesting idea. Some IR blocking filters are "hot mirrors" which are coated to reflect IR. Maybe it's possible to remove the coating (but maybe not so easy). Other IR blocking filters are absorbtive glass, so they cannot be modified.
2. Tom Benedict started a [good thread at the KAP forum on single camera IR systems](http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/kap/discuss/index.php?p=/discussion/4813/ir-ndvi-bg3-superblue-oh-my/p1) and mentioned that: 

    "In the case of IR blocking filters, these are fixed characteristics of the optical system at the time the lenses are designed. So most lens designers will design in a little     negative spherical to compensate for the IR blocking filter. When you remove the IR blocking filter, you essentially introduce negative spherical into the optical prescription.     It helps if you can put that back in. That's why a number of places that do full-spectrum conversions will stick an AR coated BK7 window in front of the detector."

He was referring to optical compensation. Correcting for image distortion in software is possible, but correcting for spherical aberration in software might be tough (how would the software know which of the photons hitting a pixel did not belong there?).
