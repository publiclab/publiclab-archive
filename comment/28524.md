Thank you for the review [@ruthnwaiganjo](/profile/ruthnwaiganjo). Actually, since its mentioned in this issue https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/4072, and here https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/main/doc/DATA_MODEL.md that map should be migrated to notes type. I had also asked [@warren](/profile/warren) in the chatroom about this and he also clarified that notes type is preferred. I also do think it's better to migrate map content types to notes type than page type because notes type has more similarities with the map content types than the wiki types and thus migration will be easier. Talking about FTO's, I will definitely add a section for that. What made Public Lab great for me was how welcoming it was for a beginner and I will definitely try to help other newcomers to get started off with Public Lab. Thanks a lot again!
