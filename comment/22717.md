I’m still waiting on my Riffle and I’m a rank beginner so this response needs to be accepted with a grain of salt. I believe that what Chris said is right on the point. I have coded both the KnowFlow and the mini-pearl. Beyond the obvious differences for discrete vs streaming sampling and given the same environmental sensor, there is considerable overlap in the code. That’s a fair number of caveats, but coding with one goes a long way toward coding the other. David
