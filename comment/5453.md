I think your analysis is good. NIR is passing through all three Bayer filters (even the green channel has light foliage). So there is not a very good visible-light only channel. I don't see how option 3 above (a filter to clean the blue channel) could work. NIR is passing through all Bayer filters and seriously contaminating all channels. You can't add a filter that blocks most of the NIR (you just removed one of those). If you add a filter that blocks some NIR, maybe the green channel would see mostly visible light and another channel would see mostly NIR.  But it seems like a stretch.

Channel math might be the only option with this camera, but I never quite understood how that works.
