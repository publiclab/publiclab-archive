Since March 13, companies don't have to report spills during COVID19, so, I am sure.

Odor reports to NRC are now more reliable indicators of spills than the companies. 

Even if they smell oil coming from the property, they can call the NRC with the Suspected Responsible Party.  With just an odor complaint, the NRC will report out the suspected spill to Colorado Health and Environment for follow up.  Often the state agency will not be able to respond quickly enough, but if you make 10 odor reports, they will begin to plan around dealing with the facility. 

Also, they should
1) Call 1-800-424-8802  National Response Center
2) Report the odor and Suspected Responsible Pary
3) Request the NRC Number and a copy of the NRC emailed report
4) track their report on Skytruth Alerts https://alerts.skytruth.org/

I can't recommend Skytruth enough!  Often the company IS reporting, but the community is never notified. But air incident reports are down to 27% of normal in Louisiana since the Federal announcement to suspend reporting requirements.
