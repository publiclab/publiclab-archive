 Hi, [@B-winters](/profile/B-winters) - thanks for writing in. If you're comfortable using the command line and a Raspberry Pi, there is an offline version of a good bit of the back-end of the software available here: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/

We have an ongoing project to bring the whole capture interface to offline use, and that code can also be used for that purpose, although it's very preliminary and has lots of caveats. 

For v1, are you referring to the difference between these two pages? 

v2: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/150599

v1: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/150599?v=1

Thanks for the feedback - can you tell us a bit about what works better in v1 that isn't working for you in v2? That'll help us improve it. Thank you again.
