Yes, I conducted my own test by correcting values using both menus on two copies of a single photo and the photos came out identical.  
This is how the values seem to be translated-

Using GIMP-Lens Distortion-

and using BIMP Batch Editing dialog-

Its rendering now, so hopefully it makes a noticeable difference when I try to upload onto a new map.  If not, I was looking into the HUGIN Panorama editor which has lens correction and batch processing but makes Gimp look like iPhoto in terms of complexity...  So I'm hoping it doesn't come down to that...
