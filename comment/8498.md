We discussed this today during organizers call. Jeff and I recalled Nathan Craig's note about using free Surface From Motion (SFM) tools for scaled measurements. You may want to also consider these tools for this application to measure volume. In addition to your aerial photos, you may want to use the same camera to take a set of ground-based photos of the mound of interest. These tools also offer the ability to capture a orthomosaic, "map view" either as a specific export or as an image of that view. For recent discussions on some of these tools, see:

For Nathan Craig's note see:
http://publiclab.org/notes/ncraig/11-25-2011/photographs-scaled-3d-model-using-free-software
The first part of the video deals with a free tool, Hypr3D, that has changed, to Cubify. Since the change, I've not had luck using it. For earlier examples see:
http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/2-10-2012/thatchmore-farms-hypr3d-model

However, Autodesk offers free desktop and web-based tools that allow one to make and download 3D models. For the results from ~80 images, using their web tool, see:

At 3:45 into the video Nathan Craig shows downloading and working with model in meshlab and demonstrates ability to scale and make measurements. With these it should enable one to make volumetric measurements. I'll see what I can do with the Hoover dam example.
