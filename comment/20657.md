Here is the adapter! We're making some on a lasercutter and some on a 3d printer, but it's a /very/ simple part -- the tough part for us is getting the size of the hole just right -- not too loose or too tight. Note that this:

1. will allow switching lenses!
2. is universal between the Raspberry Pi version and the webcam version. 

The 3d model for this is here: https://github.com/publiclab/community-microscope/blob/master/lens-adapter.stl

And the hole is /just/ slightly bigger than 3/4 inches.
