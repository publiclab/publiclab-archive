[@CherokeeConcernedCitizens](/profile/CherokeeConcernedCitizens) To help keep track of the samples you've already taken and see any patterns in the varied results you're getting, it might be helpful to create a map of your results? The map could also then be a visual tool to assist planning your next round of sampling. 

Here are a couple activity posts on how to make these kinds of maps:
