Thanks cfasie.  I understand now the exposure issue you raise.

But you seem to assume the different exposures are an unknown, which it strikes me is not the case.

So how about, given:
  C1: unmodified camera, yields (R,G,B) for each pixel
  C2: IR filter removed, yields (R2,G2,B2)

  C1 exposure is e1 seconds
  C2 will have more energy on the sensor, hence a lower exposure e2, where e2 < e1

So C2 will have, in the simple case:
  (N'+xR,N'+xG,N'+xB)
  where 0 < x < 1
The exposure will affect N as well, so taking
  N = N'/x
C2 will have
  x(N+R,N+G,N+B)
assuming that the exposure time affects all frequencies equally (seems reasonable?)
  
The factor x is deducible from the relative exposure: 
  x = e2/e2
  assuming a linear relationaship between exposure and sensor reading (is this also reasonable?)

So, one extracts the exposures from the exif data, and calculates x as above.

Then N can be calculated from
  R2/x - R
= (xN + xR)/x - R
= N + R - R
= N

Putting this together with C2 yields:
  (N,R,G,B)

In the more complex case
  (N1,N2,N3) = (C2 - C1)/x where C1 and C2 are 3-tuples

f-stop is not relevant, because the Mobius has no iris.

How does that look to you?
