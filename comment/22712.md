Hi! The materials shipped in the mini balloon mapping kit are for prototyping -- there's not actually a finished "design" they're intended for, but we're hoping folks will get involved in prototyping what a good design would be.

There are some ideas and suggestions already posted here, to get you started -- also, feel free to ask more questions or reach out to other community members (or staff) as you try things out!
