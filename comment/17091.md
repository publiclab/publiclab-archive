Although this question was pasted verbatim from another site, a link was added to the text "DS18B20." This link was not in the original StackExchange post and appeared to be a link to an innocuous spec sheet on the DS18B20 sensor. But it seems obvious that this link was the motivation for posting this question. The link was to a pdf, which could potentially harbor harmful code, so I deleted the link. It might be more likely that the motivation was to game search by embedding links to a particular website, but either way deleting the link seemed like a good course of action. Moderating this user is probably also a good idea.
