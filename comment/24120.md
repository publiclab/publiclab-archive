Perfect, thank you [@d1g1t4ld1n4](/profile/d1g1t4ld1n4)!  I recently did my FTO, but since I'm new to the community, I didn't want to start anything that didn't have the support of the community.  I'm sure there are some ongoing directions that the development of the site is taking so I want to make sure I'm hooked into that.  Thanks again!
