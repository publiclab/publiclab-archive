Hi [@gautami_gg](/profile/gautami_gg), a very detailed and nice proposal.
While going through this proposal I have some doubts :

1. I like the idea of showing the posts in the carousel form but what all posts are you going to show in carousal? Are you going to show some specific post or all the posts? 

2. In a couple of places the references are incorrect I guess can you please correct them?

3. I think we can have a place where we show trending posts although we are already showing the trending topics, we can have a place where can show these. What do you think?

4. Cards design on the dashboard is very well thought and completing all the purpose without going to the actual page.

5. I think as you have moved the ask a question and wiki section to the drop down and to the tab respectively, there is plenty of space left in the sidebar when the drop-down button is not clicked. I think we can use that space too.

6. Is opening a model there a good idea because we won't be able to show as much data and posts we are showing in https://publiclab.org/questions page like"Recently Asked" and all sections. What do you think?

BTW very nice and well thought-out proposal. üëç  üéâ 

Thanks!
