The idea with "reply by tweet" is that we automatically tweet out each note -- this we do already, at http://twitter.com/publiclab (using IFTTT.com) -- so any replies to that tweet would get copied back to the original note. 

You're right -- the reference back may be tough. We could:

1. follow the link in the tweet to resolve the correct node to comment on
2. post the tweets in a different way and save the tweet ID, and perhaps save that in a tag like `tweet:___ID___` on the node

i'm sure there are other ways too!
