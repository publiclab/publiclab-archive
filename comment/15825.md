[@stef](/profile/stef), thanks for the curve data. While the data is useful for comparison with relative sensitivity curves of other cameras, the data, unfortunately, is all relative values and did not include specific information about sensor chip absolute sensitivity, noise or dynamic range. All silicon sensors have similar response curves, as do camera Bayer filters, but their absolute sensitivity, noise and dynamic range can be quite different -- and those three factors play a more important role within a spectrometer application.
