Yes, I have experience.  But it's old enough that it may not be helpful.

A company made rubber stoppers for test tubes, drug stoppers, etc.  The stoppers are normally black and take a colorant-usually carbon black.  The carbon black needed tested for safety. One test was for PNAs ( polynuclear aromatics, also called PAH).

Their are probably more modern ways to do the test. If I remember right, this method started out with a large amount of sample in a soxhlet extractor.  After about 24 hours of extraction, a visible scan was taken of the material and compared to a standard.  Calculation was done and the amount of PNA calculated.  It's not bad,except this was not a water based extraction.

I  think public lab used to have a paper on PAHs , PNAs, etc.  Could be wrong.  I couldn't find the paper.
