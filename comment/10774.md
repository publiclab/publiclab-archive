I'm currently reworking Anish's work, so that's good that you've done more on Vidun's. 

https://github.com/publiclab/ImageDistortLeaflet

I'd like to integrate your work as soon as possible, so it doesn't fall too far behind the main trunk. 

The main thing I worry about with [@anishshah101](/profile/anishshah101)'s code is that by using CSS transforms (although they are super high res and super efficient! They run on my phone!) we may not be able eventually to use the code to run exports in JavaScript on the client side. But the advantages are clear for near-term, and once the plugin is structured and integrated a bit more and build into MapKnitter, it's modular enough that we can swap in a canvas-based (maybe webgl!) distortion solution later. 

At the moment, I'm debugging, getting it to work even after the window's been resized, reorganizing where code lives, and merging the drag, distort, rotate, and scale functions so they can be run on the same image.
