I am working on a more detailed write up on how to make one of these. Also I am trying to figure out GitHub so I can upload the code I used on the Stellaris LaunchPad microcontroller. 

The photodiode array is a single row (768 X 1 element). The software does allow some control over the integration time, but for the most part the exposure was figured out by trial and error and a little luck. If you notice, on the LED and incandescent raw output spectra, the maximum intensity is only 1000 and 2500 intensity units respectively. Ideally the maximum intensity would be around 4096 for the 12 bit analog to digital reading on the microcontroller, so there is still some more optimization to be done. 

The distance between the slit and the grating is not something I have experimented with. This setup just seemed to work and allowed for a relatively rugged and compact design. I am definitely interested in ways to optimize the design without increasing to cost or complexity too much.
