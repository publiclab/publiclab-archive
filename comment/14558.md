Hmm, interesting. I don't know much about paper assays, but [this kit available online](http://www.hach.com/nitrate-and-nitrite-test-strips/product?id=7640211606) says:

> Smallest Increment: Steps: 0, 0.15, 0.3, 1, 1.5, 3 ppm

would that be sensitive enough? It's available for $21.39. What are the drawbacks or limitations, if any, to paper based tests?
