Hi jdburnett – It sounds like you have quite a nice collection of cameras. It would be great to run some calibration tests with different cameras and different targets. It would also be nice to be able to test the results of the calibration using a field spectrometer to see how well the calibrated images produce NDVI values of a landscape. A desktop spectrometer could also work if you can get vegetation samples prepared and scanned quickly enough. I've been using R scripts for all of my processing since it can calculate the regression coefficients and create the NDVI images. I'm happy to send you the scripts I'm using if that's helpful. If you want to talk about this we can set up a call.

Chris – I used 650 for the red just because that seemed to be a good number to start with. I want to test other wavelengths to see which give the best correlation. That can be automated with the scripts I'm using. I also want to simulate broad band reflectance using an average. Is that what you meant by “using several at once”? I'm not expecting that to make a significant difference but it should be tested. 

I don't see an advantage of using different color targets unless perhaps we are calibrating an RGB camera. It seems like some colored material, like construction paper, has a similar NIR response regardless of the color. The best targets would have a relatively flat response across all wavelengths but those are a little costly. I have a feeling that a black and white target would work quite well. With fairly simple testing we should be able to find some answers to these questions.

On a related note, although I tried to remove the effect of the gamma correction in my first test I'm not certain that's necessary. If the same gamma correction is used for all bands then I think that effect (nonlinear sensor response) will disappear in the division of the NDVI formula. That also needs to be tested.
