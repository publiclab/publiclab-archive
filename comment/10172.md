I know I should put these in as Github issues, but here are my notes on first use, before I head out to lunch:

I logged in before creating a map but it still says 'by Anonymous'

any way to go back to place search through Google Maps API when creating a map? currently ou really need lat lon to start a map.

It won't accept degrees, minutes, seconds format for lat/long, only decimal
	30.287087, -97.732172
	30°17'13.5"N 97°43'55.8"W

I couldn't change the location of the map after saving the wrong coordinates--- map recenters to the wrong place, even when I enter new ones and hit save.

I accidentally hit the 'delete' key and my map became toast-- at least in my edit window.  I went back to the home screen.  It was gone. Made a new one.

can't see "create map" button unless my browser window is full screen (13" screen)

could start at a lower zoom level where most mapknitter maps start.

any way to have a re-center the map around starting location button?
	if I scrolll around I can lose my place and its hard to get back. (if i hit 'enter') in the lat/lon box I get re-centered, so the feature is there.

upload doesn't have description of what buttons do, no upload in progress message, uploads failed 2/3 of the time.

I can't figure out how to place images at all.

annotations

no "close" function on a line is confusing-- can't click the first point to turn it into a polygon.

pointer needs a new logo.  I love the feature though. 

There is no way to tie text to either the map scale or the pointer.   We need both.

no way to change the color of annotations. 

'edit' and 'trashcan' appear twice in my screen, can't find a functional difference.


Annotations are not saved-- they disappear when I leave a map.
