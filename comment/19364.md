There are a few " killers" in the referenced article.  One was the remark about converting arsenic to volatile hydrides.  One of those hydrides could be a nasty gas ( arsine or arsenic trihydride).  The other was the mention of the analytical technique of inductively coupled plasma (ICP).  A very good technique but usually expensive.

I've been looking for a good, safe, method for arsenic analysis for a long time.  Please keep looking for good methods.
