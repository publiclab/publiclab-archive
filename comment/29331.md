Thanks to everyone for sharing their new work, prior experiences, and aspirations on this thread ⭐️ . The community at Public Lab seeks to encourage each other while sharing what knowledge we can, and to articulate what we don't know in a way that invites others —whom we may not have even met yet—to contribute from their experiences as well. 🏆
