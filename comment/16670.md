I love that Grove sells premade wires of different lengths with those connectors on them. Are the pin "pitches" (isn't that what you call the spacing?) the same? I've definitely used some connectors that weren't originally designed for an Arduino just straight onto the pins -- two is easier than four, though, if the spacing isn't just right.
