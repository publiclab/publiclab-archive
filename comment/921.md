I bet he is just busy. Anyhow, do you anticipate that your ras pi will be online? or just recording to an SD card? The raspberry pi should be able to run the processing app, but maybe we could just write a script for it so it would store all the data in a directory, then have a script to upload it all when you get the SD card back to a web connection.
