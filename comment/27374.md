Thanks for all the advice.  This class will be online next semester due to the pandemic (I’m assuming).  We have no resources or facilities to distribute the equipment so I am looking for stuff they can buy and use in their bedroom.  I really doubt they have blank DVDs lying around, so buying a diffraction grating seems like the best option.

For spectroscopy, I’m thinking of both qualitative descriptions of spectra from the cell phone photos and then measuring absorption and/or fluorescence spectra from food coloring using your software.  I read you can extract fluorescein from highlighters, so that might be fun.
