Here is a <a href="http://leaksource.wordpress.com/2013/04/07/thank-you-exxon-mayflower-arkansas-new-oil-lake/">gritty report</a> of some "activists" exploring the new oil pond in Mayflower. Although <a href="http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/1/124.full">images of oiled birds</a> have been a staple of media reports about oil spills for 50 years, it may be that "the bird, oiled" will become the new icon of public outrage about these spills.
