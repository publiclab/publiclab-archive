[@MadTinker](/profile/MadTinker), I uploaded a pdf to github. 
There are 2 drawings, one is the mounting plate which should be printed by a laser cutting machine. It's not necessary, find a normal board and tape your components to it is enough.
Another one is the water proof box, the size and number is for your reference. : )
