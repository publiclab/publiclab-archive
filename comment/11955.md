The device is based on the publicÂ´s lab one, is one of the project that i posted time ago, the only thing that changes is the calibration(I used two lasers) and the software.

About the metal detection, I have to test more samples( I want to test iron , nickel and silver at least) but the solution that I show you in the photo is not concentrated, so I suppose that you can detect the presence of metals in solution, however unless this metals were rare metals which has very specific fingerprint you probably won't be able to differentiate in between metals, if you want to detect metals specifically, I will suggest to use a selective precipitation method, is a really very well-known method, is very accurate and very simple and we can detect almost all the most common metals with some basic chemicals.


About the other result i have obtained with the chloroform, I am also very surprised but i have done it twice and i obtained the same result, I have even obtained another interesting difference between ice and water, I have looked on net and there is supposed to be a small difference due to the short or large range order arrangement of water molecules in the sample,but the difference is much smaller than the one that i have obtained with the chloroform  and the water(it might also be an experimental error)

About the range , ideally it would nice to reach around 2000 nm at that point , theoretically some characteristic peaks of multiple bonds will be significant enough to detect some functional groups.
