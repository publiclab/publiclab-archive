I do have a copy of edition two, which is four volumes.  Volume 1 goes over microscopes, volume 2 gives pictures of the different materials, and volumes 3 and 4 seem to talk about SEM and TEM.  

As for silica, there are a number of pictures.  The book points out, on page 304, that there are many forms of silica.  It lists quartz , sand, ground quartz, amethyst, opal, flint, vitreous silica, and diatomaceous earth as different forms.  

I didn't check all of those forms, but a number of those are shown in the book.
