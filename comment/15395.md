Hi, Dave - I like this -- maybe "Materials" could become "Suggested materials" since people may get creative there -- from, say, cast resins, to who knows, cast concrete?

[@abdul](/profile/abdul) - I like this sort of "levels" approach -- perhaps the current DSSK is aimed at Dave's level 2, and clear documentation could swap glue for velcro (as in [your build](https://publiclab.org/notes/abdul/08-11-2016/constructing-a-desktop-spectrometer-with-no-wood-and-no-velcro)) for most people? I think if the slit is separated from the exterior body, the paper is then only providing light blockage, which is nice. And upgrades like something based on [the rigid housing prototype](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/04-21-2016/prototype-of-easy-to-build-rigid-spectrometer-housing) could be aiming for level 3, perhaps. 

If you included recommendations for increasing rigidity in [the wood-less design](https://publiclab.org/notes/abdul/08-11-2016/constructing-a-desktop-spectrometer-with-no-wood-and-no-velcro), it could be shipped aimed at level 1, but easily upgraded to level 2, maybe.
