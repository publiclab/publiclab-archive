It seems that reflections between the air/glass/air/silicon boundaries adds constructively and destructively to make the interference fringes. Also is dependant of glass thickness. The fringe spacing is decreasing toward the red (NIR) edge. 
After all this chips are manufactured for imaging white light. Surfing the web I noticed that amateur and also professional astronomers have encountered this kind of problem when trying to build custom made spectrometers with comercial available ccd chips.
Spectrometer manufacturers are changing that protective glass with some kind of wedged glass (not parallel surfaces) or AR coated glass. Obviously removing the protective glass is very difficult and risky operation.
I also suspected that is some kind of slit diffraction projected onto the chip and I tried with several slit spacing from 50 microns to around 500 microns. The fringing was still there with exact spacing increasing toward red, only the amplitude was lower perhaps because of losing resolution with increasing slit width. Not to mention that I have changed the lenses, mirrors, diffractions gratings (glass 300 l/mm, plastic foil 500 l/mm, plastic foil 1000 l/mm) without any success. 
So that's it I am struggling now with math to find a way to supress the fringes without loosing signal information.
By the way here is a simple method to calculate the slit width using only a laser pointer and a ruler <a href="http://www.astrosurf.com/thizy/lhires3/index-en.html">slit width calculator</a>
