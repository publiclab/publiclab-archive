We could have more than one of those larger LED's that we're currently using, but it might be bulky. One bulb on could be green, two bulbs on could be yellow, three bulbs on could be red? 

However I'm not sure how easily detectible the increase in number of bulbs on/light level would be so it might not be a viable suggestion, we'd have to test it out. Would we be able to video it, convert the video to grayscale and see if it is noticeable?
