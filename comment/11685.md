The generated float image does not have float values in it. It is just a normal image where the plugin converts float value -1.0 to Red = 0x00 Green = 0x00 Blue = 0x00 and float value 1.0 to Red = 0xFF Green = 0xFF Blue = 0xFF. It is a gray scale image.

I expect if I load the generated float image from the PhotoMonitoringPlugin in Fiji and apply the same lut which the PhotoMonitoringPlugin uses too generate the color image the result should be the same. seems it is not.
When I use my own generated gray image (float image) and apply the same lut than the result is almost the same as (my pairing algorithm give a little bit different match) PhotoMonitoringPlugin. So I'm wondering if the float image generated by PhotoMonitoringPlugin is correct. I will try the scatterplot approch
