[@Kalarav](/profile/Kalarav), yes, I think it's possible to align the images, even when one is RGB and the other one is NIR. Actually, the examples in the blog post discuss the alignment of the R, G, and B channels on mis-aligned photos. I think that the problem discussed in the post is very similar to trying to align a RGB (converted to grayscale) and a NIR channel.

Good luck!
