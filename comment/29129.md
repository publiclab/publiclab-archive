The blood analyzer instruments from say 2000 were good, but not an order of magnitude better than those of a few years earlier.  What was different was the chemistry.  Although the instrument companies would probably argue that.  They were doing all kinds of work with tagging compounds with chemiluminescents, flourescents, and just starting work on the bioluminescents.  It was right about that time I changed companies.  Lost track of the chemistry from there.  But adding something to waste water for analysis is definitely a possibility.
