I can't help much with the infragram.org process. It seems to be pretty easy to produce an image that doesn't have any obvious relationship to the original. If it helps any, one of your images is exactly what you would get if you computed NDVI from the original and applied the Fastie colormap:  
.  
[![DaisyNDVIa.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/131/medium/DaisyNDVIa.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/131/original/DaisyNDVIa.jpg)  
*Unadulterated NDVI made in Fiji from John's original photo. This is the result you should get at infragram.org if you just ask for NDVI with the Fastie colormap. The NDVI values should be much higher for the healthy lawn plants.*  
.  
The NDVI values are too low because the camera did not have an appropriate custom white balance setting.  It is very hard to correct this after the fact, but just as a test I swapped the green and blue channels which made all the blue values lower and increased the difference between blue and red for all the plant pixels. This produced a slightly orange version of your original photo:  
.

*An arbitrary swap of the blue and green channels produced this image.*  
.  
That orange image looks more like a photo from a blue filtered infrared camera should look, although it should be much deeper orange. It produces an NDVI image with higher values than the original:  
.  
[![DaisyBxGNDVIa.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/135/medium/DaisyBxGNDVIa.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/135/original/DaisyBxGNDVIa.jpg)  
*NDVI image from the channel-swapped version of John's photo. NDVI values are higher and closer to where they should be.*  
.  
It's not necessary to swap the channels to produce this NDVI image. The same result is obtained if you use the green channel instead of blue as the visible data when NDVI is computed (red is used for NIR). I think Infragram.org allows you to do that.  

To capture photos that make meaningful NDVI without additional manipulation, do a custom white balance while filling the frame with blue paper in the shade but under a blue sky.

Anybody know the name of that little daisy that has been blooming this month all through the lawns in London's Royal Parks?
