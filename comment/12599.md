Hello [@monoxyde](/profile/monoxyde),

First of all, let me tell you, those pictures are great. You can actually see the difference between vegetation, soil & sky, which is really great.

I am really new at this, I'm a student doing a BSc thesis about remote sensing and forest fires, I know a lot about vegetation indices, drought and moisture indices, etc. So now I was trying to compare the remote sensing data with some photography and spectroscopy data, this is why I'm here. I already downloaded FIJI for ImageJ and Photo Monitoring plugin. I took some pictures with Mobius Infragram Point & Shoot Plant Cam, and I tried to do what you and [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) say about the settings. This is where I start having some problems.. first of all, the images I get doesnt have any green on vegetation (after applying NDVI settings in FIJI, see pictures below) I think it might be a calibration problem? The other thing I noticed is that I didn't get that NDVI scale you got on your pictures (the one that shows NDVI colors from white to pink, from -1 to +1). I know it might be some simple thing that im missing, but Ive really tried most of the options and nothing happened. I just wanted to know if you could tell me how to do it. Id be very grateful. 

Thank you very much!
