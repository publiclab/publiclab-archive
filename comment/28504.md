That's a pretty insightful proposal [@waridrox](/profile/waridrox) . I dabbed a bit into the history of spectral-workbench, how it was made modular, adapting the `js` lib partly and now finally integrating it back. I am looking forward to the end product 🚀 🚀 

I was wondering how exactly do you configure the app to be live at `/v1` and `/v2`. Do we have different set of servers running and they pointing into individual domains? Or is it a single server which is configured to serve them both. If that is the case
>stored in a beta file like /app/views/capture/index2.html.erb to avoid breaking functionalities in the current version.

I can see this in the proposal, I would prefer something the entire new integration to be in a separate folder like `/app/v2/views` instead of individual files being renamed, that would seem more idiomatic i guess. What do you think about it?

I also love the rear camera support thing, I can see some of the spectrometery kits that rely on phone's rear camera, this would be huge. ⭐️ 

Agreeing to Jeff on the awesome visually compelling timeline, let me know how did you make it! I might wanna grab that as well 😝 

P.s. It would be great if you could review my proposal as well 😺
