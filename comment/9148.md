Also: how hard would it be to rig up some sort of 'pen' that connects to a 555 and writes out a 'record' of the conductivity on some physical medium?  Writing onto a paper strip like a seismograph is cool -- but maybe difficult?  Is there some other way to translate a changing voltage into something that creates a 'written record'; -- even if it only lasts for a few days?  Sand patterns on surface vibrated at these frequencies?  Some other material vibrated that would show a 'history' -- like corn starch and water?
