 Right ... the optical distances are very small ;-) which is why mechanical rigidity is so important ... (think of the 'optical bench' which is made from a block of granite).

On the issue of glass ... I'd thought that microscope slides are typically borosilicate glass which has a UV '90% transmission knee' at about 300nm (effectively 100% at 400nm and longer wavelengths) while the NoIR camera sensitivity is down to near zero at 350nm. So, a 50-mil thick slide seems unlikely to have a significant impact on the web-cam's own UV limitations. Also, obtaining useful camera pixel data below about 20% sensitivity of saturation (as in anything below 390nm) will often be swamped by noise. Just a thought.
