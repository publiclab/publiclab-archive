[@shantler](/profile/shantler) [@rockets](/profile/rockets) et al... FWIW - I ordered the (majority) of the parts needed for a KnowFlow related system (sans the DO sensor and the enclosure) along with a Riffle kit.  I'll be putting together a separate EC sensor for the Riffile and will eventually need enclosures for both.    The project involves the deployment of the sensors and not just the build.  Is a Wiki the best place to document this effort (assuming there is interest)?
