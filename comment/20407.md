Excited that you might create a wiki page for "lead" !
You can create it by clicking the button on https://publiclab.org/tag/lead that says "Add one now". 

While editing this new page, you can add this single line of text in the text area: 

`[questions:lead]` 

and it will automagically display all the questions asked so far about lead in a cute grid. 

If you want to do more, you can add: 

`[notes:lead]` 

...all the research notes posted so far will display in another grid. 

Voila!
