Hi [@warren](/profile/warren), thank you for the question and providing us the open-source hardware definition. After going through it, we agree that our MicrobeMeter does not comply with it. MicrobeMeter is open-source in the sense that the blueprints are available to download and all details of its design and application are explained [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/04/407742.article-info). With this information, anyone can build MicrobeMeter on their own.

Unfortunately, we are not able make MicrobeMeter as an open-source hardware due to the way it is licensed to our startup company. As we develop new products through this company, we will be able to consider to make them as open-source hardware.

Thank you very much for pointing this out to us, and apologies for any misunderstanding caused. We have now updated our Kickstarter page to reflect this distinction.
