[@warren](/profile/warren) Definitely had this in mind. We already have quite a few automation mechanisms in place, including the message mirroring. But if there's something a prebuilt library cannot provide, it is automation on publiclab.org itself. This was exactly what I had in mind when I came up with this. A bot that manages "all of publiclab's automation needs". As of the platform, people can catch the chatbot side of our versatile bot on any of our chatrooms. Also, it could be pretty neat if we could embed a mini-chatroom of sorts within the webapp itself. Tell me what you think about it
