Hi guys.

Trying to use this camera with facetracknoir. It worked normal but I wanted to remove the ir filter for better results. I followed JoshMC sequence but unfortunaly I destroyed the filter, but thats ok since I wanna use the cam for headtracking only. After I put my cam together, I placed a disc tape in front of the cam as a filter. But something went wrong. The cam sees only black space. Whether I use light or not the cam cannot spot the leds I use for headtracking. It can see nothing. Did I damaged the cam or is it something else? I took some precautions i.e. not to expose the cam in daylight while I was removing the filter, use hairdryer and so on... 

Plz help.
