the fluorecence looks the same even when the laser heads into the sample at a slightly different angle-- is the light path critical? I figured it only mattered if fluorescence decay was what we're after.

The gel cap is a standard object that is more easily available than a cuvette, and seals the oil in quite well, even for storage.  Most of those cuvettes seam to leak.  But you're right, the cuvettes do look attractive.  Jeff sent me a few too.
