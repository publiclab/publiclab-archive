Dear All

I have attached the first image with my modified camera, where internal hot mirror filter is  replaced by the Lifepixel super color filter , in the following link.
https://www.dropbox.com/s/42r5s5rx9713tr3/DSC_0046.JPG
I have also the RAW image format of it which i did not include here now because of large size. 

I need to get the pure NIR and Red band or equivalent from this kind of images so that i can make NDVI images. I will be happy to see your comments , suggestions always how this can be best achieved. 

Thank you all. Merry Christmas and Happy New year.
