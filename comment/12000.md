Hi Liz, thanks for your appreciation. Because there is water shortage in Taiwan in spring, we want to know how severe the sedimentation really is, and practice the map knitting skill. We represent NUKIM on this project, and I am student of professor Han Wei, so actually I don't know whether the development problem occurred or not, haha!
