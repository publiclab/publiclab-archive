ok, THANKS all of you for the answers. I like that my research note elicits answers that can also affect other. I am interested to make experiences with NIR and NDVI at this stage and make a step forward. 
I'm not sure I understood all Chris wrote. I guess I miss a lot of basic knowledge. Waiting to get colored surfaces with ROSCO colors that suggested Mathew, change the Pi Cam filter from blue to red; 
I could put in greenhouse two calibration target in short time: 1) the cardboard I photographed, 2) tar paper. 

Do you think it'll can improve the NDVI transformation for my goals?

Mathew I didn't understand where I can buy "TV White" and "TV Black" and how much those cost, because the linked page "Where to buy" give me "an unexpected error".  

Best regards
