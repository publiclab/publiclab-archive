I believe the configuration with 45 and 20 deg was extracted from physically experimenting on the first PLab design. ( I think they were having difficulty mounting the grating close to the camera with Velcro...). I included the following ray-trace in one of my notes which looked at image non-linearity:

The spacing from grating to camera is essentially decided by the camera lens so ends up being very close and parallel; but not touching -- which puts the camera sub-assembly at 45-deg to the normal from the slit. Fortunately, this makes the camera / grating module simpler.
