Thanks again Chris , actually the question as phrased , was not very specific . I noticed that my Mobius against wide-angle lens , for aerial applications, Lost light and contours and show problems in the shadow pixels. I would try to change , removing IR filter and entering blue filter on a Canon PowerShot ELPH 130is  , as explained in great tutorial Video by Dennis Baldwin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgBNznwiMJQ. 

I believe that the Mobius with RED filter  and the right White Balance setup, is best suited for pictures taken from the ground to the vertical vegetation and not for aerial photos. 
But this is and wants to be just my humble opinion , with little information and few tests to prove it . I'm buying online a Canon PowerShot ELPH 130is because in Italy has never been marketed .
Let's see how it will behave once modified and adjusted the White Balance, in flight with gimbal on my exacopter .
Some advice?
Thank you!
