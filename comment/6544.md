Thinking about how to do this well... did you print on a laserprinter? Can you run transparency through one of those? Would inkjet work, or would it smudge? 

If this works well, we could have a printer run off a huge # of them and start shipping them in all the kits. For now, it'd at least be great to send one to those NASA folks trying to scan flares, and anyone else on the list who wants one. If we can hammer out a prototype design, I can arrange to have them shipped from our fulfillment center in Portland.
