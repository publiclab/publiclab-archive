hi matt: thanks for the link -- i'll pass it on! we have some really creative kite designers and they're absolutely curious about trying out other kite designs. they've impressively built some kite frames that are about a meter long and a meter high out of whittled carizo branches -
the last one was a large flat panel with pointed roof in the middle. i'll be sure to post a photo of those designs and how they work out in the air!
