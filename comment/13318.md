Thanks for your help clarifying ideas & procedures.
As it's winter and cold, indoor air is often desert dry. So I'm not worried about the wallpaper yet, Chris. And if humidity lowers the dust level, that would be great.
Scott, not many people around here can afford ++$2000. Median household income in the area is ~ $44,000.
One reason for using diatoms is that they probably make cleaning up silica much less hazardous.
Dead diatoms=diatomaceous earth, which is a non-crystalline, amorphous form of silica. The living diatoms form a brown mat on the ponds near silica sites. One variety is called "brown snot." I assume live diatoms likewise have cell walls of amorphous silica. 
An IARC monograph states:
"Crystalline silica inhaled in the form of quartz or cristobalite from occupational
sources is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1)
Amorphous silica is not classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3)."

[Notice the authors say "...from occupational sources." This was used as the justification that the WI DNR gave for saying that silica in <u>ambient</u> air had never been shown to be dangerous. The only evidence of hazard came from studies of occupational sources.
My opinion is that if an unsafe occupational level is established, where a person breathes for 8 hours a day, then the unsafe level for 24 hours a day of ambient air exposure should be 1/3 of the occupational level.]
