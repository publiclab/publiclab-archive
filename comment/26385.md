Hi! Yes good question. Also check out this page: https://publiclab.org/wiki/frac-sand It's related to sand mining, but there would be similar concerns there. They've run into issues with spills in their waterways and with air pollution. There are emerging concerns now with radon.  That one is new and I think less is known about it at this time, but rock and gravel activity can increase the risks of radon in homes.
