Chris, thanks for the kind words. Do you see or would you expect noticeable differences with CMOS vs. CCD? and if so, would you expect them to contribute negatively?

I processed this photo with the latest ImageJ (Fiji) using Ned Horning's plugin this time using the LUT16 color table. Using others like the rainbow table don't change the results much.

Here the results are stretched with 2.0 stretching. Meaning it probably goes for the highest and lowest and stretches those results into -1.0 to 1.0.  So if NIR reflection is a bit low (or considered low due to white balance), you'd get some really large variations.

I'm also considering that the green channel bleeds into the blue channel somehow, or in a weird kind of way, because the images also from green towels gives me a lot of blues on the greens.

Tomorrow I intend to white balance on a red flower in sunshine (if it appears) near the pool area and then reshoot to see what happens. I'm considering the possibility that white balancing without a lot of NIR present (which is invisible) is skewing results a lot. As we can see a red surface, but not a surface that reflects red and the amount of NIR it reflects, we can't be exactly sure. Basically I'm seeing that it's not just the color of the white balance sheet that makes the difference, but also the material. The material being the closest predictor of how much NIR it reflects to fall into the camera sensor. Eg. how well does origami paper reflect NIR vs. the emissions of NIR of a LED?

What would be a good test is to make a shoebox with an arduino with 2 LED's... One of the correct color and another LED for the NIR range of a certain intensity. Then white balance off that and get back in the field.

I have already accustomed to the fact that these are "data pictures" and that I shouldn't expect cool looking photos. In other articles I see people trying to bring white balance back to 'normal', but this ignores the fact that NIR may be present in completely different amounts. White balance is basically adjusting the camera's interpretation of the environment's lighting conditions to bring it back to the ground truth. So if you have too much yellow or blue, it would compensate for those lighting conditions (which it cannot know in advance). So if you have visible red light and a certain amount of NIR, what should the actual image look like?  I think a lot more red than usual (not true in my case), as the presence of NIR is less than the presence of VIS light. This probably greatly offsets my results.
