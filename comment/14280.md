Good work on the balloon maths - hopefully will come in useful for other people. Also your research into which lines and winders - quite a common question probably.

I'll go with the one you recommended (from KAPshop). Is 90lbs strong enough? Also they don't say they're Dacron, but the other lines on their page are.

The reels look simple enough. I noticed some online have a handle/bearings/etc to let you wind it in/out but I assume that's not really necessary.

Thanks again for all your advice!

I'll definitely explain the flash thing soon :)
