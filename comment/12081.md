[@ygzstc](/profile/ygzstc) - pointing you at this note since you've ordered some very bright UV LEDs. 

Oops, missed your comment mathew - we'll have to try that, though at this point the switch to the Infragram-type camera has sort of solved our dimness issues. If Yagiz is able to get LEDs to work, someday we could switch to LEDs with a knob dimmer. That'd be rad.
