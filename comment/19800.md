Thanks for catching that: I just updated the link on the page. I am having some difficulty getting my video feed to appear in the sandbox, am wondering if it's an issue with my own privacy/blocker settings or something else (Firefox and Chrome are both stuck for me) but will tinker with it a bit and see if there's something on the user side that might be hanging me up. Let us know if you're successful!
