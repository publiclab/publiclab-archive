This is a follow-up to our post about using Nokia 5110 screens on three unused analog lines with shift-out​.  That saved me from messing with the hardware SPI bus which we reserve for the SD cards.  A secondary benefit is that the code is really lean, on the order of about 250 bytes for the default font after the compile if you already have EEprom.h in the build anyway.  The font, however takes up about 500 bytes, and I wanted the smallest possible footprint so that we could add live data output to loggers that are already compile near the memory limits.  As it turns out, stuffing those fonts into the internal EEprom was pretty easy to do:
