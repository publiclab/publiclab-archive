You're right, that would be a revealing test.  In the example you referred to (below), the red channel should be three times more sensitive than the blue at 750 nm. The in-camera processing probably won't be designed to deal with that difference (because it usually does not have to deal with NIR light), so the red channel might get more light assigned to it than it needs.  
.

We don't know what kind of color filter array the Mobius (or any small CMOS camera) has. It might not be Bayer. However, I might have [taken a photo of the Mobius array](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plots-infrared/OrwG8xREDfI). If I had a 750 nm LED I would do the test.

In the note on [Mobius NDVI](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-26-2014/mobius-ndvi), the Mobius photo with a Wratten 25A filter produced good NDVI. Here are the three channels of that photo:

.  

The red channel was not assigned too much light, even though the incoming light must have included plenty at 750 nm. The white balance settings had the proportion Red 310, Green 500, Blue 700. That de-emphasized the red channel just the right amount. The blue channel should be darkened a bit next time.
