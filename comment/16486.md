Hi, [@ccpandhare](/profile/ccpandhare), [@siaw23](/profile/siaw23), [@mkashyap354](/profile/mkashyap354), [@Ashan](/profile/Ashan), [@Khamba](/profile/Khamba), [@mridulnagpal](/profile/mridulnagpal), [@ryzokuken](/profile/ryzokuken), [@inzamam](/profile/inzamam), [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996), [@ashwinvasudevan](/profile/ashwinvasudevan) -- just a note to look at my last comment, and reply that you understand, or ask questions.

I hope to leave comments on everybody's work today but we'll see how far I get. Please also read through my comments on each others' proposals, leave your own, and see the kinds of things I ask people to provide -- it may be relevant input for your proposals as well. I'm often asking for how we can break projects up into smaller, testable parts that can be completed in less than a week, and for how you plan to write tests for parts of the code. If I don't get to commenting on your proposal, please bear those general comments in mind!
