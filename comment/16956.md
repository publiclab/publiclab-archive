[@ramarro](/profile/ramarro), you tried so many stuff! Thanks for the info on EC, I am learning it.
Lots of the questions you mentioned I don't know the answer, I asked yoyo (the main developer of DF's water sensor) to reply here directly, hopefully he will come.
I use this thing to monitor river pollution, I used to test KH by test strips but didn't give much attention to this parameters. 
Speaking of Atlas, the parameters they chose looks to me are more for general river monitoring other than aquarium, what do you think? I only tried their DO, it's too expansive (especially because I'm in China). I don't like their design as well. I have to either use bread board or soldering pins, not beginner friendly...
