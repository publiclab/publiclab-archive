Regular USB webcam works with the raspberry pi so that is another work around. I will find another use for the pi camera. I am happy to support Public Lab, I have no "buyers remorse" and I look forward to purchasing other Public Lab projects. That said perhaps the Public Lab store could be a bit more transparent and provide a bit more direction regarding the software challenges using its Lego Spectrometer Kit with Raspberry Pi Camera and Raspberry Pi which is currently priced at $85. Thanks very much.
