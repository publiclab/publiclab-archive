If this is largely done through self reporting and the information is coming from a group that expects such toxins to be present, I have two very serious psychological/sociological concerns:

Expectation bias or experimenter's bias. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimenter%27s_bias
" In what is called the observer-expectancy effect, the experimenter may subtly communicate their expectations for the outcome of the study to the participants, causing them to alter their behavior to conform to those expectations. Such observer bias effects are near-universal in human data interpretation under expectation and in the presence of imperfect cultural and methodological norms that promote or enforce objectivity."

Mass hysteria. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_hysteria
"In medicine the term is used to describe the spontaneous manifestation of the same or similar hysterical physical symptoms by more than one person. A common manifestation of mass hysteria occurs when a group of people believe they are suffering from a similar disease or ailment, sometimes referred to as mass psychogenic illness or epidemic hysteria."

I am very concerned that you might get exactly the results you want because you setup to suggest that you want certain results in the first place. Worse yet, if people buy into that expectation strongly enough, and since we are dealing with a health issue, they could begin to manifest symptoms that aren't inherently formed from a physical basis.

Are any steps being taken to consider or address issues like these?
