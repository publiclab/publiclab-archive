Thank you for sharing your proposal idea [@SahilS](/profile/SahilS),
I have some feedback/suggestions:

1. Expounding points from the _Education-related usability upgrades_ ideas that you have not addressed in your proposal https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/9257 for example _Filter out known spam from replies to comments_

2. What tests do you anticipate writing? Unit, system, functional.

3. Are there any accessibility features you expect to add?

4. Will you create first-timer issues from this project that will invite other new users?

5. In the _Other improvements _ section, expound on the points shared since those improvements are important as well.

Thank you so much for the proposal. I would suggest having a look at past proposals, to see how you can further improve yours https://publiclab.org/notes/cess/03-02-2020/call-for-2020-soc-proposals-gsoc-and-outreachy

All the best!
