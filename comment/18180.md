Thanks Chris, 
Actually as I read more papers I am finding that many of the newer references are using:
NDVI=(NIR-R)/(NIR+R) 
rather than the blue and green channels.

Before I strip down the Canon camera I am going to do some testing with a Raspberry Pi and the Infragram filters as I can easily budget for two eBay Pi IR cameras and set one as NIR+R and one as NIR+BG and run some tests for myself.

Reading the recent literature and the links that you included above I suspect that the NIR+R will be the option I go with on the UAV in the end.
