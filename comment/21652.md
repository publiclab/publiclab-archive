Thank you, Sidharth!
I was also in the same dilemma whether we should use angular or react but then I realized that we are using rails and angular also follows the same pattern that is model view type of thing(not exactly but the flow is somewhat like that) which makes it easier for our other plots2 contributor to easily get involve in the project even if they donot know angular becuase of similarity of flow between rails and angular. And plus some other advantages of angular is that it is a framework which means it automatically do a lot of thing for us which helps us writing the code faster instead of thinking about the flow just like we have in rails and on the other hand react is a library and lack some of the advantage that we have in angular but it does have some advantage we don't have in angular.
Glad you liked the idea. Let's do brainstroming over it.
Thanks!
