That's a good idea to use only one color of light. It can make it easier to interpret the result. Your result is very consistent with the two peaks of chlorophyll a. I would have also expected to see some strong absorbance between 450 and 500 nm attributable to chlorophyll b. Do you know why this peak was absent in your results?

What does your spectrometer use as a sensor? It would be good to learn more about your design.  

Thanks,  
Chris
