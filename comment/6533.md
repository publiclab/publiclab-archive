I wonder about the peaks appearing to shift between different exposures.  Looking at the left most peak the filtered 8 second exposure is to the right of the unfiltered exposure while the 16 second exposure is the opposite case.  What is the cause?
I also wonder what the spectrum would look like if you subtracted the "Warm white IKEA LED" spectrum.
