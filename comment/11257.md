You might then also consider a u-ch shape for the camera block. That would nicely control the exact spacing between camera and DVD which is important. THen all you need do is make the appropriate two cuts at 45-deg (the top of the piece need not be flat as in my proto). Also, if the channel is kept  to just 1/2-in, there is more surface area to support the slit w/paper-fold against a flat surface so it is held firm and flat. I don't know that the baffle is very critical but it seemed to help some with reflections and is cheap to add. I also noticed that the camera module on the PC board was not perfectly mounted on mine and there is the effect of camera angle (side to side when mounted) which results in the spectral image moving up/dn the image. While it doesn't matter if it's centered (the line can be reset in SWB) once the position is set by the user, if the camera tilts on it's tape mounting, that will translate into variable relative intensity. All this just means that while the camera 45-deg angle needs to be stable, so does the mounting to the camera doesn't move. Maybe a 1/2-in wide tape would be more secure?
