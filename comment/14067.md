Re: square wave, I feel really out of my comfort zone here, but that's ok :). I know to make a square wave voltage source, you have to add up sine waves until you get something more or less square, but I haven't thought about going the other way - measuring on/off signals from the photocurrent of a photodiode.

If I'm imagining right,
1. the LED turns on, 
2. the photodiode generates a voltage that ramps up and plateaus, 
3. the LED turns off
4. the photodiode voltage decays rapidly down to ambient levels.

like this http://www.bme-bergmann.de/LR4_1MHz.gif (repeat 1000 times a second).

and we're just trying to measure the voltage value at the plateau. Do you still get harmonics in this scenario?
