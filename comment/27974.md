You will need to tweak the method a little more, with volumes amounts of  material added, etc.  This should be viable for ammonium nitrate based materials.  Some more head scratching is needed for the melamine based materials.  The common approach is kjeldahl.  A real pain method that is not always reliable.  NIR has been used, also.
