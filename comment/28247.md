Hi! It's a good question. CFLs have multiple very strong and stable lines, so it's hard to find something like that. If we had infrared we might use the missing lines from the atmospheric spectrum. But they're not in the visible range so not everyone can use them. 

We could use 2 colored lasers but again it's not that easy to find. 

What about, maybe, burning a little salt, and using the sodium line? But again it's only one reference, so then we'd have to burn 2 things. Is there something we could heat up in a candle flame that would have 2 strong emission lines?
