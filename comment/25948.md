Hi, you can use this simpler sequence for that:

[https://sequencer.publiclab.org/examples/#steps=ndvi,colormap](https://sequencer.publiclab.org/examples/#steps=ndvi,colormap)

This will just apply NDVI and the colormap to a single image. You may need to select the filter color you're using (looks like a red filter).

Also, you need to white balance your image -- in the camera, ideally. See this page for more on this! https://publiclab.org/wiki/infrablue-white-balance

You may be able to get by a bit by white balancing after the fact, using this sequence. But your data won't be as good as if you white balance the camera itself!
