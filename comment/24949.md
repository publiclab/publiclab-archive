Ah yes of course! I know you can do it in GIS but I don't have the software. This is a good way round it.
And maybe this is a feature I will put into my final mapknitter evaluation post! As being able to measure distance and areas directly would be really useful.

Your project looks really interesting, I'm very curious to see how it develops!
