Hey Jeff, yeah that's an ultra-brite LED (high current/high-flux output.) it's just mounted on a heat sink assmbly.

I have a few of those, but they are RGB LEDs and white. 

The 395nm flashlight that I use are 5mm Ultra-violet LED's. Emits blue 395nm UV light. Water-clear lens. 3.7 Vdc, 20 mA. 30 degree beam pattern. and there are 51 of them, pwr suppy is only 3.0vdc. I could emulate the same thing you have there with only one ultra-brite blue or violet LED running on the same pwr supply.
