[@tech4gt](/profile/tech4gt) The PWA idea and the RESTful API sounds very good!
Good proposal overall. Although I think you can work a bit more on the GPU issue and plan for it. I tried covering that in my GSoC project last year, but it turned out to be more time consuming than I thought and we couldn't do it in the stipulated time frame.

The issue with this is some modules work with canvas and some don't. Running those which don't on the GPU means getting into WebGL. Basically, this goes towards WebGL no matter which direction you start in -- speaking solely based on experience!

I'd like to hear more about this! Sounds promising! Though you could work a bit more on the timeline and decide a focus for your proposal, as the ideas you have mentioned are no doubt great, but are vast as well. I personally feel that deciding a scope/domain is important before starting off with anything!

[@warren](/profile/warren) Yes! The proposal is a very fine one indeed! I agree that some work on the UI is definitely needed.
