Now there is a new set of references.

*A newly corrected image (background) of the diffraction pattern of Snowy Sky CFL with emission lines shifted more carefully to match the 14 emission lines from Wikipedia (dashed lines), and the intensity trace (pink) derived in Spectral Workbench from the new image of the diffraction pattern.*  

Definitely not traceable to NBS.
