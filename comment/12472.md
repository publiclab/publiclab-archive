Hi CHUMBA,

It looks like the Rosco 116 is a very good filter for NDVI. Compared to the 2007, it passes less red, has a steeper cutoff between red and blue/green, transmits more total light, and passes more green so the green channel is more useful. It seems to make very good NDVI images even without a custom white balance, which is very handy. It makes good false color IR images if you swap the blue and green channels (so they are NBG instead of NRG). Here are some NBG images.

The Rosco 116 seems to be a very versatile filter for this work.
