 Love this! I think there are a bunch of use cases, yeah! also there's a number of power drill based centrifuges out there... 

This method for extracting [#pah](/tag/pah) from fish also calls for a centrifuge, there wasn't much else on the site about them though: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/11-25-2013/poster-on-issues-with-pah-detection-in-fish
