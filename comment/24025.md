This is great, thanks [@kkoerner](/profile/kkoerner) -- and interesting to see that they'll flag sensors. I wonder how much two would have to not correlate before it got flagged. Any interest in blocking one of your fan ports on the Purple Air to see if you can get it to flag itself? I may get one of ours out to try this too. 

I wonder if it would get flagged immediately, or if they have to be reading different values for a while before it's flagged?
