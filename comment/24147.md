The specs for the TPL-5110 timer IC say it can time intervals up to 7200 seconds (2 hours). It seems unlikely that it could be extended beyond that.

However, it is probably possible to time an eight hour interval by using a TPL5110 to wake up an Arduino every two hours and having it check a variable saved in flash memory, then incrementing and saving that variable back to flash memory before proceeding to the rest of the sketch where a decision is made about whether eight hours have elapsed.
