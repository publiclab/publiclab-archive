Thanks Liz, Mathew and Dan for your comments.

[@Liz](/profile/Liz), we feel we have a lot of photos and are putting them together. We are doing it offline on photoshop, due to sensitivities of having the info online (for the time being).

[@Mathew](/profile/Mathew), the patch at the end was strong tape. This allowed us not to lose the helium we had, but once empty it was difficult to properly patch it up. One of the youth who mapped with us, worked at a tyre shop and there they tried possible durable options with little luck. I will look for a photo....

[@Danbeavers](/profile/Danbeavers), the kite we used was from Public Lab's kit. We started with a kite, but it was very hard to control from the rooftops - [@firas](/profile/firas) and [@mustafa10](/profile/mustafa10) climbed all over people's roofs when we did so!  The balloon was also the one sold by Public Lab. It was shot with a pellet gun, and so a small hole was made when the balloon was in mid air. It did not burst, but you could tell in mid air that something was going wrong. This meant we had to bring it down fast and patch it.

In this photo, you can see us trying to avoid the new construction in the camp!
