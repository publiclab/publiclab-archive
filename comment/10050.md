Hmm, ok, I just closed that window (perhaps the links on the image and filename should take you to where those images are in the map?)

and went to "view images" to get to where it was placed, but it says:

`Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token , 107.178.213.64/beta/maps/autoplace-test:1`

Its oddly placed too:

However, when i upload, the console says:


    Zoom for image1.212696391871741 cartagen.js:9417
    Placing Image 33 at Lat:42.94540022222222, Long87.8989181388889 cartagen.js:9451

    hh,wh:77.30706599637952, 103.07608799517268 

The response to the AJAX request from the upload was:

    {"files":[{"name":"IMG_20140420_180322.jpg","thumbnail_url":"/warpables/0000/0033/IMG_20140420_180322_thumb.jpg","url":"/warpables/0000/0033/IMG_20140420_180322_medium.jpg","delete_type":"DELETE","delete_url":"/warpables/0000/0033/IMG_20140420_180322_#<Warpable:0x7fd20979ad00>.jpg","size":1417132,"id":33}]}

I think perhaps it's not seeing GPS info or something? since it doesn't seem to send any back. Or is GPS determined in Javascript?
