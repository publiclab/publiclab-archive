That's really useful information. I can see the advantage of having every scientific instrument accessible on the web or network. Being able to remotely log onto each instrument and update code or change parameters opens up important possibilities.

I also like the idea that programming and interacting with an instrument requires only an SSH connection (whatever that is) which is apparently easy to have on any computing device. Setting up and maintaining the Arduino IDE on your computer (with board definitions and libraries) can be a big project. Doing this for every student's computer could be an obstacle. Although I assume those Arduino board definitions and libraries are going to be needed if your goal is to "use the raspberry pi to program an Arduino via the command line." Does that mean that some form of the Arduino IDE will be installed on each Raspberry Pi? I guess I don't really understand the architecture you're proposing or what workflows will be possible.

While most Arduinos are not connected to a network, they can be. [ESP boards](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/01-10-2019/what-would-you-do-with-sensorship) have integrated Wi-Fi which allows remote two-way communication with the board. It is straightforward to send sensor data from the ESP to a local server or to the web, so there is no need for a clock or local storage (timestamps are provided by the server which saves all the data). 

ESP boards generally cost 10% of the price of a Raspberry Pi board. If some of the shortcomings of Arduino disappear,  the remaining benefits of Raspberry Pi have to be central. I get the impression you think they are.
