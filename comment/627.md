I just looked and could not a picture but I have just taken the camera strap and tied it to my upper arm, or my belt. It is more symbolic than anything. The camera could possibly damage the tail of the plane if you dropped it. But I never want to find out :) So I hold on tight with both hands and practice the routine of pulling it out and tightening the clamp while on the ground so that during the flight when there is more wind and noise it is familiar.
