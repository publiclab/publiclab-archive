Hi Chris ([@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)).
This pictures (the third in every serie of 3) are not produced directly from the camera, as you say. First, I take a picture without any filter (the first picture in the serie of 3); then, I take another picture with the exposed film as filter (the second picture in the serie of 3); finally, with these 2 pictures align, in GIMP, I do exactly as [@Warren](/profile/Warren) says it here: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-27-2011/video-tutorial-creating-false-color-ndvi-aerial-wetlands-imagery. Resulting in the third picture of every serie.
So, it is really necessary do it with a custom white balance? Maybe I don't fully understand yet how the NDVI works, but it cannot be calculated with this filter? Why?
Greetings!
