Hi, Cindy - wow, you had spectacularly well-lit scans! Your laser must be quite powerful, or your camera especially sensitive. I wonder what accounts for this variation, as I know not everyone's been able to get such clear bright spectra. 

I was also worried that your crude sample would be too dark to see the fluorescence, but it looks like it worked fine -- huh! Interesting! I was about to suggest diluting in mineral oil but i guess it's not necessary.

I was especially interested to see the "find similar" function match to [@ethanbass](/profile/ethanbass)'s diesel samples. Great!
