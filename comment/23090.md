For what it's worth, the Lego Spectrometer page lays out some reasons why the lego version is going to replace the 3.0 version:

So maybe lego is best! But i'm interested -- one thing that could be tested is also the length of the spectrometer. [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) has done some great length tests and with a much nicer Rasberry Pi camera these become relevant! 

I think Chris's post is this one, but maybe he can correct me -- i searched for a bit but this was a few years ago: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/2-19-2013/ebert

(also nice lego work here: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/2-5-2013/grating-angle)
