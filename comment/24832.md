That's a great question, especially since there are many examples of things in nature that would have a bimodal distribution. 

A full rundown of statistical methods probably isn't best done in the comments, but I definitely encourage you to write and share posts or even a collection of resources about it. We're currently building up resources for student-led environmental monitoring studies, which this is included in. 

[@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) would you be interested in mentoring students when they get to the data analysis portion of their projects? I'm hoping to gather a group of contributors to ping in and you seem interested in talking about it!
