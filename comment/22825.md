Hi, we've long wanted to implement this feature but haven't yet. There's an open request here where we're hoping someone can help out in solving this!

https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/issues/84

We'll also need a means to store the order in MapKnitter itself, and a few other changes. I've listed them in this issue: https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/116

Hopefully we get this resolved soon, but it's a multi-part feature. Thanks for bumping this up!
