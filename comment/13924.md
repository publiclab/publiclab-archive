That's a really relevant article. They scale the graphs relative to a standard, so 100% is actually 20% reflectance. That means 25% reflectance of chalkboard paint (at 90°) is really 5%, or at 45° is about 3%. That's what you would expect for matte black paint. So that might be a hard surface to get exposed well in a photograph. They don't name the brand of paint, so any old chalkboard paint could be different. However, a search in [NASA's Aster Spectral Library](http://speclib.jpl.nasa.gov/search-1/manmade) suggests that most flat black paints have a similar flat response through the visible and NIR.

Some gray paint might have a flat response, but every gray paint might not. Your targets don't have to have a flat response, you just have to know what the response is at the wavelengths of interest. If somebody with a spectrometer bought some flat gray exterior paint at Home Depot (or any ubiquitous brand) and characterized the response, then everybody could make their own targets. I guess a few shades of gray would be needed.
