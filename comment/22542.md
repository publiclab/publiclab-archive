That's true Chris [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)! You read through to the heart of my internal question on this too: is it worth it to try to hack commercially available sensors to do something beyond / different from what they were produced to do, and I appreciate your candor in spelling out that the answer is probably no. Thank you for that. Cheers!
