[@stoft](/profile/stoft) Hey dave, yes you are absolutely correct, that is why I need to purchase either a notch filter or longpass filter for the 532nm laser, both filters are very expensive and there are a few more steps I would have to incorporate in order to get the spectrometer to operate as a raman spectrometer.

I do have a high powered 470nm Blue LED that I can use, its just that the FWHM is so wide I'm not sure the data will be any better?
