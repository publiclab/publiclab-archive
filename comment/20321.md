Hi [@WaterGeek](/profile/WaterGeek) -- Yes! The Riffle is available in the Public Lab store-- you can see our whole collection of sensors and loggers here: https://publiclab.myshopify.com/collections/water-monitoring. We've recently added some of the loggers that [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) has developed and featured on the site, and are working to add more items to the list. If there are things you're interested in seeing (either for sale in the store, or demonstrated on the website), let us know!

Out of curiosity, what kind of monitoring are you hoping to do?
