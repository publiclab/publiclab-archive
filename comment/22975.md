The first two times I tried the Rev. P wind sensor, I also tried the Rev. C sensor. The Rev. C sensor did not work as well as the Rev. P, so I focused on the Rev. P afterwards. Although I never got the Rev. C sensor to work well, that was probably user error. There are some good reasons to consider the Rev. C sensor, especially for student projects.

1. The Rev. C wind sensor is cheaper ($17 vs $24).
2. The Rev. C sensor is less vulnerable to breakage.
3. The Rev. C sensor can be powered with three or four AA or AAA batteries instead of  requiring a 9v battery (in fact, the specs say the Rev. P needs 10-12 volts, which is downright inconvenient).

Another consideration for student projects is to include other sensors in the payload. A record of wind speed for a kite flight becomes more interesting and educational if there are simultaneous records of other variables. A BME280 sensor provides very good information about air temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure. Barometric pressure is an excellent proxy for altitude, and temperature and humidity vary with altitude in predictable ways because science.
