Perhaps I missed the explination but please help me understand why you don't just sum the 3 bands. It seems to me that the operative filter is the grating and you want to know the total amount of light hitting a region of the sensor. The color of the light has already been established from the grating and you just want an intensity value at that location. It would seem wrong to me to throw away some intensity information when trying to improve sensitivity to low values. Perhaps that is just the low value end of the scale.
On the high end of the scale; with a band of saturation in one channel the other channels usually are not saturated so it would seem that they would provide relavant intensity information. Thus summing all channels makes sense to me.
