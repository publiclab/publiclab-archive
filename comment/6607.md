I hope your system is mechanically stable so as to get reproducible spectra.  With regard to the illumination spectrum (the LED), it is not truly white i.e. it is not uniform across the range of wavelengths that your camera is sensitive to.  The sensitivity of the camera is probably not all that uniform either.  To normalize your sample spectrum, you will want you to divide (not subtract) the sample spectrum by the illumination (LED) or reference spectrum on a pixel by pixel basis.  Use an sample empty bottle for the illumination spectrum.  Then add your water sample to the bottle for your sample spectrum. This will largely cancel the effects of the LED spectrum and the color sensitivity characteristics of the camera, as well as the effects of the bottle.  Use the same shutter speed for both spectra.  Dividing the sample spectrum by the illumination spectrum gives what is known as the transmission spectrum, which varies from 0 to 1 for each pixel.  It ideally is a characteristic of the sample alone, the "instrument function" having been eliminated by the above normalization.  As long as you are doing math on the spectra, you might as well go for the whole enchilada.  Take the negative logarithm of the transmission spectrum, again on a pixel-by-pixel basis.  These values will vary linearly with concentration of the light absorbing species in your sample.  Look up Beer's law on the web or in any introductory chemistry book.

Now for the bad news.  What ever may be in your water samples may not absorb in the visible range.  Further, unless your water is very bad and your spectrometer very sensitive, you may not have enough sensitivity to see anything in the spectra.  As a test, try adding some food coloring to your water sample.  Try several concentrations to see how the spectral amplitudes vary.  If you want to get even fancier, you can take a "dark spectrum" i.e. no illumination and subtract it from both sample and reference spectra before normalizing to correct for any ambient light leakage or baseline errors in the camera.
