I suppose I am old school, and my job is to struggle to get more science and evidence into environmental decision making, but there are funding consequences for scientists for making poltiical statements. 

Climategate, to me, is more a witch hunt than some question of scientific legitimacy.  I would protect professional scientists from persecution they receive from studying difficult subjects. 

Unfortunately, this is affecting us at LUMCON directly, as LSU has removed Dr Nancy Rabalais from her position at LUMCON, and they seek to reconfigure the institution away from education and mentoring and toward hard research. Dr Rabalais also studies the Dead Zone, which is a very politically unpopular issue. 

This decision may impact, eventually, our ability to meet at LUMCON.
