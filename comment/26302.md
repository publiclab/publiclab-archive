New Orleans residents complained and protested about the illegal fill of City Park wetlands by the Bayou District Foundation Golf course, and the City Park Improvement Association was ordered to pay mitigation to fund wetland forest restoration in Springfield, LA.  Taylor Energy has leaked oil into the Gulf of Mexico since 2004, but it took complaints since 2010, from the academic and NGO community, for the USCG to commit to containment in 2019--they have since retrieved over 250,000 gallons of oil from Mississippi Canyon. HealthyGulf threatened to sue the Grand Isle Independent Levee District for the illegal construction of a jetport in a $300 Million bird sanctuary, and the Louisiana Widllife and Fisheries Commission dropped an agreement with GIILD. Grand Isle IID apologized and withdrew the plans.
