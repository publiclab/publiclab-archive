Hi [@warren](/profile/warren),

Yes, would love to test out the page as it is now.

Would it be possible to upgrade my account to a moderator? Right now I can't publish or edit a wiki (because mine is a new account) and I don't want to be sending another question out there for no reason (in order to get rid of the "newcomer" flag) - I'm sure you are all busy answering pertinent questions already :) 

If you can't, let me know, and I'll make sure to post a question.
