Hi, Borys - i'd love to learn more; have you considered joining the Public Lab mailing list?

So at this time, I think 330 nm is out  of the range of our tool; i'm only sure of 400+ nm. But with different optics, like maybe a pinhole instead of a lens, i think 330 could be possible... we'd have to do some tests.
