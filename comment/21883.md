 OK, i've been going through this a good bit and I tried out some of the ideas discussed above, while also digging into the "card" design a bit more. 

First, i tried collapsing the "Featured topics" into the header of the activity feed:


[![Screen_Shot_2019-02-15_at_4.48.18_PM.png](/i/29390)](/i/29390?size=original)

This seemed OK, and clicking on a topic could open that up /within/ the activity feed -- i.e. filter for just one topic area. Then you'd see only posts on that topic. 

Then I thought, what if we display cards for TOPICS rather than for individual posts. I ran with this idea a bit and there are some advantages:

1. you don't need to click to see a range of topics
2. getting topics to appear on your dashboard could be the same as subscribing to them
3. we could "start" people with ~5 default topics that are our featured topics
4. you can "dismiss" them from your dashboard by unsubscribing
5. you can post directly into a topic, rather than adding tags later
6. you can see immediately how many other people are involved in the topic
7. we can offer additional topics to subscribe to below, and if people unsubscribe from most topics, the prompt to add new topic subscriptions will be more visible (since nothing will push it down)
8. we can auto-subscribe people to nearby placename-topics

I couldn't decide at first if we should show a list of people in each topic card, or if it should be more like a list of posts in that topic, and I leaned towards the latter:

I didn't figure out where to put the blog. It could actually be its own topic, in theory. But I wasn't sure about that. 

Here's a clean mockup of the page with additional topics listed below the "add new topics" prompt:
