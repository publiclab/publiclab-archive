Response from [@wicca](/profile/wicca) coming in from the midwest list: Well, take the municipal government out there to experience the experienceable. If the plant is closed during evening (municipal board hours) then set up a few board members to go in the afternoon. Talking to the companies is useless ... have the neighbors who have been impacted done anything ... attend board meetings or talked directly to the companies? Final straw ... get an attorney and file a Nuisance complaint if you have one .. or something similar. 
I'm probably preaching to the choir but what the heck ...
