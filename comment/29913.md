Mangroves are very important to environments and help us to filter out air. The issue is many mangroves have been dying off due to pollution and other harmful things, including people. Mangroves not only give protection to the animals, but they also give protection to the people around them. They act as a natural flood barrier, and without them, there would be 39% more people who get flooded annually. There are many people who are trying to restore these mangroves, and they have projected by the year of 2023 to have about 10 billion trees planted. Nearing this June millions, if not a couple billion will have already be completed. This process is being taken to restore all the mangroves that had been lost. Now we are restoring them and aiming to have a large amount planted to help our ecosystems.
