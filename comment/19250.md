Wow, this is a cool project. By the way, have you solved the problem that the RTC module can not be compatible with 5V? 
I also used this RTC module with 5V voltage. It works fine. According to the datasheet, the DS3231 chip can work fine with 2.3~5.5V.  And in order to charge the battery onboard, 5V voltage is needed.
