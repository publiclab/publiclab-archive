Hi! Love this proposal and I appreciate how you've thought through different solutions. 


[![drafts-tab.png](/i/43610)](/i/43610?s=o)

The drafts tab is super interesting. I guess it would show drafts only for that topic area (i.e. tag)? That is, do i understand right that only drafts for `water-quality` would appear on https://publiclab.org/tag/water-quality? 

I wonder if that might make it hard to find drafts if a) they don't have tags yet, or b) you may have drafts in different topics, and need to hunt around to find them? What if, alternatively, we made a drafts nav item on https://publiclab.org/notes -

But if you imagined the tab on another page, like the page listing a person's notes, like https://publiclab.org/notes/author/cess/ (note this currently [has the wrong template](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/9586)), maybe it could work. I do think we need a button leading to drafts from the dashboard though! How might that look?

Actually i think we can leave it the same as it is, as one purpose for comments in drafts if if you share the "secret" draft link with someone for feedback, they can leave comments on drafts to help the author out. Good to bear in mind!
