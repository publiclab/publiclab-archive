Getting someone else to cut the material on behalf of the laser is not costly if it is only once or twice. But once the number of times, then it is cost-effective to buy their own laser engraving machine. I purchased a [60w laser engraver](https://omtechlaser.com/products/60w-co2-laser-engraver-cutter-usb-6r57-us) from OMTech in order to be able to cut the material I wanted at any time. It's very useful when making small projects like this.
