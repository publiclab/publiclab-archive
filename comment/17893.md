Warren, we have just completed some full-scale testing. Currently we are refining and collecting data before we make any claims. We will definitely make a step-by-step activity guide, but we want to prove the concept to the best of our ability first. This should be completed by Dec. 12th, which is our Senior Design Showcase on Tufts Campus. You are welcome to come and see our design in person as well as several technologies developed by other groups that solve a wide range of problems. I will make sure you get an invite. Until then please check out the video I posted below on my Youtube account of our first full-scale test outside.
