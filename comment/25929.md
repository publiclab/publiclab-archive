Hello,
Thanks for your support.
In this we have refer below link for ndvi calculation.
http://ceholden.github.io/open-geo-tutorial/python/chapter_2_indices.html

So basiclly my code look like this in (Python Language)
<pre>
	re_img1 = cv2.imread(filename)<br />
	B, G, R = cv2.split(re_img1)<br />
	divisor = (R.astype(float) + B.astype(float))<br />
	divisor[divisor == 0] = 0.01  # Make sure we don't divide by zero!<br />
	ndvi = ((R.astype(float) - B.astype(float)) / divisor) + (1/3)	<br />
	//(R-B)/(R+B)+(1/3)<br />
	print('NDVI INDEX',round(ndvi.max(),2))//NDVI INDEX MAX -1 to 1
</pre>
[![Screenshot_(182).png](/i/36720)](/i/36720?s=o)


So see the image With diffrent formula and same image.
So ndvi index must be (-1 to 1 ) between but in this i am getting max index from numpy array so index like (1.33,1.13,etc).

# Is there any tool for ndvi index calculation.
