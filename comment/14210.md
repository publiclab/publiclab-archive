Yes, it doesnt make the assumption that all cross sections are equal because it doesn't know if you uploaded or live-waterfall-captured -- uploads may not preserve calibration over vertical variation. 

That said, if you're interested we could open an issue to make it take a best guess if it's live captured, and not invalidate calibration if so? Or maybe prompt you and ask "does calibration still hold?" ...when doing the cross section.
