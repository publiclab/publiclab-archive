Interesting stuff indeed, I have been lurking here for a while and trying to build a good documentary NDVI camera for a public gardening project.
I am hoping to try a few more filters in the next couple of weeks, seems like red may make a lot of sense.
Out of interest, are the glass Hoya 25A filters similar enough to the Wratten 25A gels?

Some of my early experiments here:
