I'm not understanding your results as shown in the graph of processed data so here's a few thoughts and questions:

- It can be helpful, when showing processed data plots, to include the sequence of data (eg. reference, difference, averaging, processing, etc.) plots which clearly show how the final plot was produced.

- The average intensity scale indicates a peak of '~25' but w/o the RGB channel data or reference plots, it is hard to guess at what to understand about the spectral intensity relative to noise. It looks like the noise is high but perhaps the signal energy is low.

- When attempting to observe fluorescence, it is desirable to eliminate the carrier signal (400nm LED spike) and keep the SNR high (low noise). The 405nm laser has the advantage that the small beam spot size (monochromatic laser instead of 30-deg angle LED) allows the UV to enter and exit through parallel sides (at a 90-deg angle to the spectrometer) of the cuvette with minimal scattering (which can enter the spectrometer). This allows for minimal attenuation for the spectrometer signal which maximizes the SNR for fluorescence spectra detection. If your LED is directly opposite (inline with the spectrometer) you might rotate the LED to the side (orthogonal to the axis of the spectrometer) when hunting for fluorescence spectra.

- The base-line noise appears to be significant (on the order of '3' pk on the scale (~=12% of pk which is, at best, only 18dB SNR for the 400nm peak) and some peaks are assigned molecular equivalents. Generally, identifying signal peaks within noise, it requires at least a 6dB SNR to declare that a 'peak' is really a signal. However, since this plot appears to be of processed data, and that data process is not described, it is not possible to know if the "signal" is a real molecular-related signal or not.

- The large peak (360-440nm) would appear to be just the '400'nm LED as it has the same general shape and width as other typical LEDs. From looking at the plot, I do not see evidence of oil fluorescence -- as typically detectable by the PLab type devices. All oil fluorescence successfully detected so far (via PLab devices) have generally been only able to detect broad signatures across the 400-650nm band. However, if you have been able to somehow extract molecular signatures of specific components which appear even within the large 400nm LED carrier signal, that would be interesting to understand.  However, the measurement and data processing trail need to be explained. When signal are present within the bandwidth of the carrier signal (e,g. like with the LED source) it usually requires a very strong signal to be detectable -- and even then, that signal will be heavily corrupted by the carrier so the weaker molecular signal's characteristics will be very difficult to detect.

- Yes, the plot shows a "lumpy" spectra of the 400nm LED carrier signature but I see no proof within this single plot that those additional contributions to the "normally smooth" broad LED spectrum are, in fact, signatures of fluorescence of oil molecules. I've not noticed such peaks within the fluorescence spectra I've observed. Again, perhaps something else in the data processing which produced this plot could explain.

- The broader question is: If the identified specific peaks, within the carrier and within the noise, are real fluorescence signals, then where is the rest of the broadband fluorescence spectra from 400-650nm which seems to be typical of crude and refined oils? The absence of that spectra suggest the light intensity of the UV LEDs is simply insufficient to excite sufficient fluorescence in the sample such that all you are viewing is the LED + noise.

Perhaps it would be good to show the data collection path (eg. plots, from reference through sample data through post-processing) and describe the processing steps which support your final plot, analysis and conclusions. That sequence makes it easier for others to both understand your work and to leverage your observations.
