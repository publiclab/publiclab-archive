You might be interested in an open-source software project I have started for analysis of imagery from the Humminbird low-cost sidescan sonar.  

https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/PyHum

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyHum

Unlike in a GIS, this software is designed to be completely automated. It reads the raw binary files, properly spatially references each beam, carry out radiometric corrections, and texture segmentation. Lots still to do. It is very much work in progress, but please check it out and contribute if you're interested!
