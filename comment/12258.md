Hi Chris, 
Edan, whom I interviewed for this, was pretty adamant that the photos he saw and used were thermal images.  I know specific kinds of cameras are necessary to record at those wavelengths (~10,000 nm, I believe), but I think the team was equipped with that sort of camera on their balloon rig.  I will verify that with Edan and edit if necessary!
