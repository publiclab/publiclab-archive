Thanks Chris!

I designed a new leg support structure and uploaded the [updated model](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1671298).

I designed the support structure using T-spline modeling (sculpt mode in Fusion 360). I'd definitely recommend watching some tutorials on it! It's a great way to quickly model more complex shapes.

Let me know if that's what you had in mind or if there need to be any other modifications.
