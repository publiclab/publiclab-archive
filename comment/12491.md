Hi  raynerfdiez, Predicting the sun's elevation for a particular time and day is possible but you would probably want to find a software library that would make the task easier. I know NOAA has a calculator for that (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/) but expect a software library is available somewhere. As far as predicting the distance between the satellite and Earth I'm not sure where you would be able to find that information and the orbital parameters to calculate that might not be publicly available. You could write to ask.usgs.gov to see if they can point you in the right direction. For what it's worth the sun elevation is in the Landsat metadata so you can get that information when you download the satellite image or go to one of many sites that have that information such as http://landsat.usgs.gov/consumer.php. The distance between satellite and Earth is not part of the metadata as far as I know. The distance from the Earth to the sun  (used for calculating reflectance) is also not in the metadata but long term averages are available here: landsathandbook.gsfc.nasa.gov/excel_docs/d.xls
