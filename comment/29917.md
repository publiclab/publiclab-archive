Caleb Hall- 4/4/2022- Steps for a homeowner to apply and obtain a groundwater well: 

              1: Submission of notification of construction, up to 60 days in advance 

             2: Have inspections of the land and surrounding area done by a licensed water well driller.  The measurements, usage, and even location of neat by wells. 

              3: Installation/ construction. If a well is being replaced, then the old one must be plugged and abandoned. 

               4: Verification/ Registration. The registration ensures that the government can properly track these wells and even provide warnings if contamination is possible.
