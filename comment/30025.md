Hi [@LakG](/profile/LakG), I like the way you've used the PL site and noted some areas to improve. I especially like your first point about `Improvised Content suggestion` and I'd like to know more about how you intend to implement this. Where on the site would this feature be added? Code snippets and diagrams would be very helpful.

I also like your suggestion about tags on the people page and I believe we've started a discussion about that in [this issue](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/11052). I'll give you a reply soon.

I'm also curious as to what your thoughts are about our ideas list for this project https://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc-ideas#Refine+User+Interfaces+across+PublicLab.org
We'd love a discussion about those ideas too.

Thanks!!
