Awesome!  I think given our workload, ordering one may be easier... I'll just wait till I hear more on that front.

Do you have a device yourself at the moment?  If I did some work on the firmware and sent it to you, could you test it out for me?  I'd be coding blind, but I think converting outputs to JSON is pretty straightforward.  Could I even just test the code on an arduino uno - shouldn't matter that the readings are nonsense right, just matters that it compiles and ships data correctly.  Then I could try it out here and make sure it works.

As an initial proof of concept, I just connected YwRobot's moisture sensor succesfully and did some quick soil moisture comparisons - worked great!  Here's the results with 4 samples and 3 moisture levels (highest peaks are high moisture, lower peaks are lower moisture), hope to post more  soon.
Here's an image of the setup, and what it looks like in the software:
