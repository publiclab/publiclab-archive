Hi! The game is a general platform for citizen science, so we anticipate that a huge variety of projects could benefit from it. 

In the specific iteration we are using for the study the game focuses on animal species and animal identification.

Here's a link to my lab:
https://web.northeastern.edu/guii/

And here's a link to the project page, the game in question is a subproject under cartoscope:

Unfortunately we are ending user studies at the end of this week (I found out about Public Lab a little late...), so this post will likely be removed soon, but I thought it would be best if I answered your questions :)
