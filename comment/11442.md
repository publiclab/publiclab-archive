Hi, Mathew, there is a CSS switch to turn off links in print mode, which we can easily add, but some people may want links in their print versions, right? We could make a button which adds this style before you print, optionally. I put the CSS line in the github issue you'd opened, here: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/196#issuecomment-88253968
