Thanks Jeff, I'll connect with [@natalie](/profile/natalie).  I'm doing a bit of research by taking a look at people who are hacking cameras.  As I've looked at images of the exposed internals, one thing that is occurring to me is that the size of the sensor is always bigger in stand alone webcams vs. laptop.  And that makes a lot of obvious sense.  So I'm thinking I might focus on those instead of sourcing new laptop cameras.
