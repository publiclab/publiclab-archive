Update -- we got some help from Archive.org -- THANKS!!! and were able to set up a proxy as a short-term solution. But the issue is now that EXIF data is not copied into the thumbnails. 

I wonder how hard it would be to get Archive.org's thumbnail generators to copy in geodata EXIF tags, or just all EXIF data. I think on ImageMagick it's default unless you use `-thumbnail geometry`.

Alternatively there are some very clever ways to read **just** the exif data from a remote image. But i haven't seen an implementation in JavaScript, just Ruby: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8583671/efficient-read-of-exif-meta-data-from-remote-images-using-ruby#8584391


**Update:** though it's very slow, check it out:
