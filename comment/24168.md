So, just recapping from a brief chat on this with [@sashadev-sky](/profile/sashadev-sky) today -- I'd LOVE to try to think of a name for this set of practices. Kind of like how people say "we work in an Agile style" -- what do people say if they want to work in a welcoming way with these strategies? I've brainstormed a bunch but nothing much good's come up: "Welcoming style" "Community-centric development"? 

[@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano) [@cess](/profile/cess)  what do you think?
