This is looking good. I love the grid layout pattern.

I see this is incomplete, but I wanted to let you know the black square (which has a slit cut into it) is not yet described in the text.

Additionally, there are six holes. It might help to specially mark the hole which needs diffraction grating in the diagram somehow. Maybe a differently colored dot? A rainbow dot? :)

I'd say there's nearly enough here for someone to put this together.
