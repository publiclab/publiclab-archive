Ally and [@cschweik](/profile/cschweik), 

That's great new stuff on the [wiki page](http://publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping-of-local-invasive-species-and-town-mapping). Nice photos of water chestnut. Were you able to get the RGB camera working? 

I have a question about a photo on the wiki of the single camera on the Titan 2 Rig. The camera wrist strap is tied to the white tubing to keep it level. Just to be sure, does that mean that you have been flying the Titan 2 Rig with the camera tray loose in the upper frame? The standard procedure is to tighten the wing nuts so the camera tray is locked in position. The Picavet suspension is designed to keep the entire rig level, and the cameras will be more steady if everything below the Picavet lines is rigid. 

I will have to send you a single camera tray that fits your upper frame so you can use the rig for either one or two cameras.

Also, when you fly just one camera, you don't need the timer and batteries to trigger the camera shutter. There is a script installed on the SD card that will trigger the shutter at any interval. I think it is called "interval.bas." Let me know if you need help getting that working.
