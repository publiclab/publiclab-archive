The forecast 5-20 km/hour wind is perfect for kite photography. From the looks of the flag and the foam streaks on the water in one of your photos, it seems like the wind was not below 15 km/hour (9 miles/hour) and maybe closer to 25 km/hour (15 miles/hour). The Stowaway Delta is a small kite for lifting a camera, so you need more wind than the typical KAP kite which can have twice the surface area and less than twice the weight of your Stowaway. So maybe you need a steady *big* breeze. 

That kite should perform acceptably with a small camera in the right wind. To reduce camera motion, your next step might be a Picavet suspension. It can make a dramatic difference compared to hanging on a single string (is that what you did?). If there is enough wind, you could also try flying with tails which tend to steady the kite. Tails and Picavet lines increase the complexity (AKA tangles) somewhat severely. All the more reason to have helpers around.

I am not impressed that they sell that kite with 50 pound line. You paid handsomely for their poor judgement. I have never flown with less than 150 pound line.
