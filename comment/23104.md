I found there's a manual calibration URL I could use:

https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/calibrate/136374?x1=165&w1=546&x2=189&w2=579

This fixed the issue for me.

(The X position of the bars is simply found by hovering over the line chart when it's uncalibrated - which gives the X value from the leftmost end of the spectral image.)
