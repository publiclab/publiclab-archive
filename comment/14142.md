1) Could be a good idea put the calibration targets of known spectral reflectivity in Greenhouse to include in the photos ? 

2) Where can I get the calibration targets? 

3) Could you link (or send me some documentation) research notes at Public Lab describe the development of a procedure for calibrating the process?
