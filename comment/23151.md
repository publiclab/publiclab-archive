Hi [@Delaney](/profile/Delaney) , I guess you were attempting to find your draft note on your profile, but for now drafts are only accessible from your dashboard.

Here's your draft link: https://publiclab.org/notes/Delaney/06-21-2018/public-lab-joins-africatown-community-for-blueway-planning-celebration-in-mobile-al

Shortly, there would be Draft section on your profile from where you can access your drafts. Sorry for inconvenience.
