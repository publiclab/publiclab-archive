UPDATE 6/29/15:

  I've managed to build most of the "buoyancy engine" with a large syringe, 3D printed parts, threaded drive bolts and metal "BBs" for ballast.  I also got the right water bottle, and the Arduino Pro Mini.

[![SGengine1.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/465/medium/SGengine1.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/465/original/SGengine1.jpg)

 
 Cross-referencing the BOM with inventories at local Home Depot etc... got me nowhere, so I just went ahead and printed out the 3D printable pieces of the buoyancy engine to serve as a reference point.  Using this method I was able to find the drive bolt, brass nut and locking washer rather easily by fitting them into the printed space.  The good news is the metal parts are relatively common.  The bad news is none of my standard or micro size servos would fit the very specific dimensions of the printed parts.  So now I have to wait until the servo with the proper dimensions arrives in a week...

  The completed Buoyancy Engine with Servo Attached should look like this image from the [official instructions](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7k70fdwv4pojlvt/AABVqyVyuY6wfI3_DpyP7hdFa/2b-%20BE%20Instructions%20Cheeky%20No%20Reflectance%20Sensor%20ver2.pdf?dl=0)

  My initial impressions are that while very impressive, this is an unusually complex diy build in terms of the conceptual engineering involved.  Its clear that it was designed by professional engineers as opposed to a casual tinkerer...  At least as far as the buoyancy engine is concerned, this does mean that the materials used must closely match those of the original build as there is little room for alterations.  This somewhat diminishes the DIY value of using common everyday objects when you really have to use the exact same water bottle, syringe, servo etc...  Luckily, the parts are still relatively inexpensive and available online.  I'm hoping the same rule does not apply to the "sensor pack" as this is where I would like to test some of the Open Water modules like RIFFLE.

   One final observation...  You can definitely tell this build came out of the Navy as more than any other DIY project I've ever worked with, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was building some kind of a bomb!  Especially after loading the 3D printed cylinder with BBs for ballast and attaching what looked a lot like a triggering mechanism... Needless to say, I would avoid taking the completed glider through an airport...
