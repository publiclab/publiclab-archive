 Hi [@edie_blues](/profile/edie_blues) - thanks, just pasting in a snapshot of the latest dashboard design here. Also, perhaps a separate post for the questions page will help keep discussion a bit threaded? Thanks!!

I like this mockup a lot, which seems a lot less cluttered than before, to be honest! 

A few things. 

1. I think I'd like to see the idea from above of the blog post being just a "pinned" item under Activity, which would drive the interactive prompt "ask a Q" up to the top. 
2. could the "Near me" area still be an interactive map? (it could be a screenshot for now)
3. What exactly would "My Projects" lead to?
4. How would the interaction of " Ask a question or write a research note" work given that it'd likely need to open a larger form (like the one at https://publiclab.org/post or https://publiclab.org/questions/new) as the next step? Would what you entered become the title? OR would it expand?
5. what more information could we show under entries in "All Topics"? Whether you're subscribed? Maybe, an icon/button to subcribe? A way to show only trending topics instead of all (using a menu, tabs, or something?)
6. actually a small thing - i think the Junction font is appropriate for titles, but most other text on the page could be the default Bootstrap font (helvetica?)

Thanks! Glad to be back from the holidays!
