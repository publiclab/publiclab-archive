The timer I have seems to be different from all three of yours.  The relay NEVER makes a loud click (although it does make a barely audible click).   The LED flashing responds well to adjustments of both potentiometers. I can duplicate the always-on LED by turning both pots all the way CC, but otherwise it flashes as it should.

So you have a different problem than I do.
