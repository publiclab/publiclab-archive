I'm writing up an introduction to particles in the air right now ([rough draft](https://publiclab.org/wiki/pm)), and one of the questions I wanted to answer was about naked eye observations of particles.  

There should be a diffusion effect when particles are between the range of 1-10Î¼m.  There must be some regular ways of qualitatively assessing small particles through measuring some aspect of their diffusion.

This EPA document on atmospheric visibility talks a bit about light extinction, and briefly describes assessing visibility by taking pictures of targets 1-10km away through telescopes.

its a compelling idea to document haze as a pollution proxy.  I want to learn more!
