I am working in a similar DVD-based webcam spectrometer to use in a telescope which gave me a CFL spectrum I already submitted to SpectralWorkbench.  One great thing about this project is that has gone through much experimentation with setups to make it easy to anyone just to assemble it from a kit. Does it work with first order or second order diffraction?
