Hi Don,
Glad to hear that you liked the explanation.  
I hope to get around to measuring some metals in water before long and once I do, I will publish research notes.  Right now, however, I am trying to focus on production and user support (like the user's manual and this setup tutorial). 
I am hopeful that we will be able to sell kits from the Public Lab store before the end of summer (2014).  I am in the process of getting a run of boards professionally fab'd, so we should be able to get these to market before long.  In the mean time, if you know anyone who wants a kit (or a finished instrument) have them email me, summers at wcu dot edu.  
Best,
Jack
