[@mathew](/profile/mathew) iframes are a problem when a user can write the iframe any way he or she choses. If an iframe is part of a code base, maybe it isn't so good, but it is highly controlled. I think this would be a case where the user cannot arbitrarily make an iframe point at some spam site or a virus site, so I don't care.
