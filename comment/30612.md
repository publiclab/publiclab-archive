The seafood that are in this picture are Gulf killi(female/male), sheepshead minnow(female/male), oyster killi fish(female/male), diamond killi fish(female/male), brown shrimp and white shrimp. Louisiana is losing alot of land to water. Manmade things are being made to prevent us losing so much water. Fresh water and salt water are mixing and affecting our seafood industry.
