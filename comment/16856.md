Did you measure the Conductivity using any meter/Probe?
Is the green colour due to eutrophication(excessive richness of nutrients in a lake or other body of water, frequently due to run-off from the land, which causes a dense growth of plant life)?
Low DO is the consequence of excessive organic matter present in the water column. 
Another parameter that would be indicative of nutrient pollution is phosphate(PO4). You could measure it using chemical provided by the same company(Kyoritsu). I have checked their site and they provide high and low concentrations.  
Another suggestion would be to check for Sulphide (Hydrogen Sulphide)(WAK-S  Kyoritsu) in the sites having rotten egg odour-smell.
