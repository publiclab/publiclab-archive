I often get tripped up on the firmware upload stage;
https://publiclab.org/notes/abdul/06-22-2016/infragram-plant-cam#Installing+config+file

The camera is either in "firmware download" or "firmware upload" mode.  If its generating a config file, that is the download mode.  The next time the button combo is use, the firmware should upload.
