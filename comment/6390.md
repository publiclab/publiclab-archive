I think this would be extremely helpful as a more easily calibrated and thus more accurate spectrometer (compared with the current "piece of CD-ROM in a box with a camera" type DIY setup. With a rigid and fixed system like this, you could take a calibration curve spectrum once (RGB lasers?) and use that to quantify the subsequent spectra. 
Check out Samir Kharusi who has done this very well: http://www.samirkharusi.net/spectrograph.html 
He used it to crease spectra of stars and planets: http://www.pbase.com/samirkharusi/stellarspectroscopy
A setup with results like that would be fantastic. Hopefully a cheap diffraction grating film would work as well as the blazed grating he used and a rigid plastic tube can be used/attached instead of a cardboard box. Not sure how you'd mass-produce a thin slit but the 2-razor blades approach works and isn't difficult. 
I had a quick go at this last week with a 2 razor blade slit at the end of a cardboard tube and using a CD-ROM with reflective coating removed as a transmissive DIY diffraction grating. Seems to work.
