Hi! Yes, you can see our files for the stages here:

[https://github.com/publiclab/community-microscope/blob/master/coro-microscope-stages.pdf](https://github.com/publiclab/community-microscope/blob/master/coro-microscope-stages.pdf)

That said, you don't need to replicate our stages exactly! I might actually suggest making these a little bigger than we have in the current file if you're using coroplast (we're going to be adjusting somewhat based on feedback from our first round of users). I think the overall size should work as/is with wood or acrylic. We have 1/4" bolts in our kit, but you can also design around whatever hardware you happen to have on hand. 

I'm a big fan of some of the stages that Hackateria has on their Wiki, here: [https://github.com/publiclab/community-microscope/blob/master/coro-microscope-stages.pdf](https://github.com/publiclab/community-microscope/blob/master/coro-microscope-stages.pdf). 

If you have a laser cutter, all you really need to make sure of is that you have a) two stages, b) holes for three bolts on both stages with a little bit of wiggle room on the top stage, c) consideration for how the webcam will sit on the bottom stage (the files we have currently has a slot to accommodate a clip on the webcam, but not everyone uses it), and d) a hole on the top stage that allows the top of the lens close access to the slide. 

Hope this helps! Would love to see how your microscopes turn out!
