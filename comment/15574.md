The spectral response figure came from an article linked in this thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plots-infrared/aJhM30D6bUM

That's a good point that the range of NIR wavelengths captured differs between the blue and green channels. But so does the range of visible light differ between them. With a Wratten 25A in place, the blue channel is going to capture very little visible light, but the green channel is going to capture quite a bit of red light. Eliminating all of this cross contamination is very hard with a single camera system.

The most direct way to check if your procedure for computing NDVI is good is to compare it to NDVI from a known system. This is what [@claytonb](/profile/claytonb) did here: https://publiclab.org/notes/Claytonb/08-13-2016/plant-health-ndvi-white-balance
