Techmoan.com does excellent gadget reviews and the guy loves dashcams. He has lots of [reviews of dashcams including his favorite the DDPai M6+](http://www.techmoan.com/blog/category/car-dvr-dashcams). The first video on that page does a good job explaining what dashcams can do. 

I think most dashcams are intended to run on USB power (from the car adapter). The Techmoan guy has a big battery pack in his car so the camera continues to record timelapse photos when he is parked (for security). This power requirement limits the applicability of many dashcams for aerial or remote location use.

Most dashcams have very wide angle lenses which is good for many applications but maybe not so good for others (getting good resolution on a water depth gauge or secchi disk unless it is very close to the camera).

The DDPai M6+ has a "parking mode" which takes timelapse photos (one photo per second) until it hears a sound and then records a three minute video, and then resumes timelapse recording. This could be a ready-to-go solution for certain monitoring like the blasting that [@bkleist](/profile/bkleist) was describing.
