HI cfastie,
Thanks for your kind response. 
I am using modified camera in these cameras I'm using customized lenses 
1. Red bandpass 650 
2. NIR  850
Using this I'm capture image at same time. I'm in Primary stage so If possible I'll fix the camera alignment or  using SIFT algorithm as per your suggestion. 

Reference images taken from Internet which already used in kind of NDVI processing. Like RGB image and NIR image it is just for to test python algorithm and NDVI output so, please tell me about that image of NDVI output is OK or not.
If need to some improvements please suggest me some good ideas. 
Which solution is best single camera or double camera.? 
I'm ready to use double camera solution as well so,  Red bandpass image  and NIR image is best for to find NDVI.? 

Thanks in advance 

Best regards 
Kalarav
