Thanks for a lot of good thoughts to consider.  

I agree that the optical paths need to be rigid, both from the slit to the DVD and from the DVD to the webcam in order to reduce noise, and (more importantly, I think) reduce the potential for drift.  I have not observed noisy data likely to result from changing path lengths and angles, but we should definitely monitor that with replicated analyses over the course of a month or two, and perhaps with some gentle jostling of the spectrometer (e.g. carry it in a backpack while riding a bike to another Public Labber's house) between analyses.  

I disagree that we need to tie the laser/cuvette assembly to the spectrometer, especially because it reduces the utility of the spectrometer piece to do other things.  As long as they are easily aligned, it should be fine.  Perhaps we can include a flat card for a base, with markings to align each piece to ensure a proper 90-degree angle between the laser and slit (through the cuvette)?  

Webcam stability is potentially an issue...  I have used two spectrometers now, and the first one my webcam wouldn't hold position when I shifted the whole case, but the one I use now is very solid.  I think a lot of the issue stems from the tension on the wires connecting the webcam to the computer, so in future versions we might want to consider that part of the design.  That being said, my webcam is totally solid right now.  

I think we do need to improve the stability of the attenuator piece.  Mine drops unexpectedly, which makes it difficult to use the same attenuation factor on multiple analyses.  

As Jeff mentioned, amplitude isn't as much of an issue as lambda-max right now for the Oil Testing Kit.  For sample concentration analyses, then amplitude would become important, but for oil type classification, wavelengths, rather than intensities, are the primary data of interest.
