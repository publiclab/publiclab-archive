Here's an example of a cheap, through-hole 'trimmer capacitor':

The trick will be figuring out what range is needed.  We can probably do this by building a few DIY probes with a given value of the capacitor C, place them in some standard solution (contact lens solution, say), and seeing how much the frequency changes across changes in geometry and probe material.  This will lead to a sort of estimated change in frequency that we need to account for in terms of a change in the capacitor value.  Excited to try this!
