Hi [@donblair](/profile/donblair),

I came across this post while dealing with the same struggle -- ambient light rejection for turbidity measurements that are open to the environment. The youtube video and the technical note links got me started on a solution, which I'd thought I'd share since this post hasn't had a followup yet.

Luis Orozco of Analog Devices gives the basic setup for a modulated photo-detection setup in Figure 10 of the technical note "Optimizing Precision Photodiode Sensor Circuit Design": a light-source is pulse-width modulated, and a photodiode detecting that light source is connected in photovoltaic mode to a transimpedance amplifier (and a second-stage gain amplifier if needed) and then AC-coupled with a capacitor and filtered. In his very elegant solution the clock that modulates the light source also controls a chopper switch connected to a precision difference amplifier to capture just the positive peak voltage of the AC-coupled signal, which is finally smoothed with a low-pass filter before sampling with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC).

With the parts I had on hand, and a less sophisticated knowledge of electronics than Orozco, I figured that the chopper and difference amp could be replaced with a full-wave rectifier. The performance may not be quite the same but it's hard to beat four plain diodes for price and simplicity. Here's a breadboard photo and a schematic done with "jellybean" components:

So, after the transimpedance amplifier and a second gain stage (on one LM358 op amp), there's a high pass filter at roughly 1.5KHz, a full wave rectifier, and a low-pass filter at roughly 15Hz. The Arduino code at the bottom of the post uses the AVR Timer1 registers to set a (roughly) 8KHz pulse on pin 9, which drives one of two IR LEDs (the other, on pin 12, is directly driven). I connected an Arduino to the breadboarded setup as described in the schematic, and connected the output of the LM358 (MOD in the schematic) to Arduino pin A0 and the demodulated signal (DEMOD) to Arduino pin A1. A basic serial interpreter (below) allows us to run some quick experiments through the Arduino serial monitor window by entering the indicated commands in sequence, hitting the Send button after each command :

1. Reset the Arduino, then turn on just the directly driven LED (command "d") and taking some readings of the output signals ("r"). The signal at pin A1 should read 0 (or rather, it will read at the level of the op amp's offset voltage). This shows that the device suitably rejects unmodulated ambient light.

2. Turn off the directly driven LED ("d"), turn on the modulated LED with a duty cycle of roughly 10% ("p100"), and take some readings ("r"). This shows that the device does a pretty reasonable job of demodulating the photodiode signal. You can do this in an area with a decent amount of ambient light and experiment with covering and uncovering the test setup, and the demodulated signal (A1) shouldn't change. 

3. However, we can see some limitations of the system if we then turn on the direct LED again ("d") -- the signal at A1 should drop to 0 (after a few seconds, given the discharge curve of the 10uF capacitor in the low-pass filter). Why does this happen? The direct LED is so bright that it's basically swamping out the signal of the modulated LED, and because there's effectively then no modulated signal leaving the op amp, nothing makes it through the band-pass and rectifier -- which highlights the difference between noise rejection and signal capture.

Electric ghosts seem to love haunting analog circuits on breadboards, so I routed the board layout below and uploaded it to OSHPark for fabrication. Will send a followup comment after assembly and testing.

I'd love to know if you got further on this project -- maybe with a solution a bit less hacky than mine :)

Cheers!
Chris
