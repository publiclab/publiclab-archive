Good points and I understand how you feel, coming at his from a chemistry teachers viewpoint myself. I guess it depends on what experiments and demonstrations you wish to carry out. As a simple demo, to observe the mercury lines in a CFL discharge, it is simple and very powerful for students. Little technology is required and some excellent chemistry principles. Simple step then to looking at other discharge lines, say using discharge tubes common in most classrooms or looking at flame spectrography.

A few resources, my intro vid to using the spectroscope in the lab with students:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j0sAD11x_0 (a bit cheesy, but gives you an idea)

my presentation at a Science teachers conference:
http://www.slideshare.net/moelfre/plots-spectroscope-sasta-presentation-2013
which runs through setting up a scope

Now that smartphones and the portable spectrometer are available through public lab, they might be a simple way to get a whole class engaged quickly.

If you wanted to run the Beer's law experiment, as it stands with the current spectral workbench capture software, you will have a bit of IT to wade through, which is unavoidable.

Compared to buying a datalogger ($800), spectrovis ($800) and the software to run it ($300) for under $10 you can build one (with the students, maybe a year 9 class) and at that price, they are almost disposable.! It is indeed a quick and very nifty hack !

good luck, where abouts are you ?
