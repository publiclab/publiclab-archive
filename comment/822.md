In the Lee, NH farm map, we have a need to put known GPS points on a MapKnitter map. This is a feature request I've heard from other prolific mappers who carry GPS devices. I was thinking of implementing a simple "thumbtack" system in MapKnitter, which could have a bit of text attached to it, and could show the GPS coordinates. Would this be an interesting first place to try doing map annotations?
