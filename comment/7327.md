If you’re set on using the PL spectrometer I’m not sure. However if your goal is to use a cheap open source instrument I know Dr. Jack Summers (http://www.wcu.edu/academics/departments-schools-colleges/cas/casdepts/chemphys/faculty-and-staff/jack-s.-summers.asp) has/is developing a potentiostat (http://publiclab.org/wiki/potentiostat) that is capable of several electrochemistry techniques. I would think you could use a method similar to these guys (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00032710903492508) who seem to have a good results in detection methane in aqueous solutions.
