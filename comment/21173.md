Hi, [@nedhorning](/profile/nedhorning)! I wanted to ask if you thought tar paper that people purchase in a store would have a consistent enough reflectance that you think it would be useful, if not perfect, using the calibration spectra you've collected of them. Or if you have a sense of how much (percentage wise, say) tar paper might vary... I imagine if it's less than 5% or even 10%, it might still be a useful improvement for many applications. 

Likewise with printer paper!

Thanks, as always, Ned! I'm working with some NASA AREN folks on calibrating images from a Raspberry Pi in live video, and teaching students about how calibration works! So they might be interested in shipping out a whole set of calibration cards with printer paper and tar paper arranged on it.
