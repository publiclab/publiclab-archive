Hi Gianni, - We are working on a new python-based version of the plugs and that will have the ability to correct dual-photo setups like yours. It will also output the corrected photos in addition to NDVI. Hopefully there will be a version for testing a a few weeks.
One way you can do it in ImageJ is to select the bands you want to use and calibrate from the two photos and create a new 3-band image to make an NDVI image. To do this in ImageJ use Image => Color => Split Channels to get the separate bands then use Image => Color => Merge Channels to select and merge the channels you want in the new image. You will loose the EXIF data but you can replace it using exiftool.
