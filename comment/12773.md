One possibility in order to get a clearer image is to try using the "threshold" filter in photoshop, or photoshop elements, GIMP, etc. 
It's helped me trace dust plumes in photos of sand mines, although that's a completely different scale. Too bad I could never offer proof that silica particles brightened and diffused sunlight.
