> Can you upload an image so we can see your setup?

It turns out that my dogs got a hold of the foldable one I made before; I'll have to make another one or buy one of the kits.  In the mean time, I can show you the images I took trying to calibrate the foldable one.  You'll see in two of the pictures there is (what I assume to be) light from the bulb I was calibrating with.  Also, I rotated the grating for two of the pictures to see how the position would affect how samples would come out.

> I can imagine scanning a few different e-liquids and perhaps common ingredients and dyes, then comparing.

That is a good idea

> What are you using as a light source?

I have a lamp without a shade currently.  I was using it to calibrate but I didn't get past that point.  If you have any suggestions for configurations of common household lights or lights that I could purchase I would be interested to hear them.
