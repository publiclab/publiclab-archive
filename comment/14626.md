Yes, both aluminum and silver oxidize very rapidly which is why all mirrors with those surfaces are coated -- the type of coating affects the mirror's spectral reflectance. However, for your experiments I'd not worry about it; front-surface should be sufficient. A cheap source of 1-in dia (you don't need a large surface area) front surface mirrors are dental-probe mirrors, sold by the box on Amazon as a mirror replacement item. With care, the metal backing/housing can be removed if needed.
