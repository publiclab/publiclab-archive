      Biodiversity refers to the variety organisms of Earth. Biodiversity also includes the evolutionary process and adaptation of changing environments of species. Blue fin tuna is the most desired tuna for human consumption consequently there are 95% fewer blue fin tuna in the Pacific. The blue fin tuna is an endangered species of tuna. The tuna is scare in species richness and species abundance because of the excessive hunting of this animal. The genetic diversity of the tuna, specifically the breeding trait, isn't enough to replenish its population at the rate it's being hunted. The blue tuna is an aquatic animal, so it is confined to the saltwater subsection of the hydrosphere - lacking ecosystem diversity. The diversity of our oceans would become unstable then must adapt to the change if there were no more Blue-Fin tuna. The predators of the blue fin tuna world must find a new prey but will also have a decrease in its population. There would also be, and abundance is the prey of the blue fin tuna. If safety precautions are not put in place the blue fin tuna will go extinct. *GIANNA WILLIAMS*
