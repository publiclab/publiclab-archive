Hi, my search for formaldehyde testing brought me to this article. I'm wondering if you could help me  with some advice - I'd appreciate it. I'm very suspicious of the floor we got installed over a year ago in our house - suspicion triggered by health issues. Just after we got it installed, I heard about the scandal involving Lumber Liquidators. I asked the installing person about his product but never got a  proper answer. I asked about laboratory tests but I was quoted over $600 which I'm not able to pay. Please let me know what would be the best way to test our flooring and air quality. Also, is it too late to test this? The floor was installed 1.5 years ago. Thank you very much
