I also do agree with [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet), I know public lab since last yr I drafted my first proposal(eventhough was not selected at that time for GSoC) and contributing since October, so we guys don't require any community bonding period. We can start the work prior to that if the mentors would wish and we got selected.
