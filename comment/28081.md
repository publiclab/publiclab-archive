There were two remote networks in the US, the  snotel (40.67mhz) and the scan network.  The scan network is mostly on the eastern half of the US and has switched from meteor to cellular.  As far as I can tell, there at still a large number of stations on meteor(snotel) in the west. At least, that's what the internet says.  Please understand, optimal range of reception is usually 500-1100 miles.  So you will probably be able to hear them.  Decode them, I don't know.  

Myself, I had a spur from the computer.  Couldn't use the RTLSDR at 40.67 mhz. So my choice was other freqs. May you have better luck.
