I think the term you are looking for is the "centroid" -- think of it as the point where the shape/volume/whatever would be physically balanced -- though I don't know if your algorithm actually finds the centroid.

Ok, good, the curve shape is oil type dependent but not concentration dependent. This is easier.

Ah, so there is is large dynamic range dependent for florescence based on oil type - makes sense. Yes, the simplest way to compensate is to set the laser intensity for a high (but not clipped) signal with olive oil and then attenuate for all other types. I suspect that the ratio between florescence intensity and laser exposure is roughly linear so you could probably attenuate either the laser or the observed signal at the camera side. However, attenuating a spot source will be harder than attenuating the light from florescence glow over a larger area. Since you don't need to be very precise about the attenuation (you will normalize the curves anyway) you just need to maintain a healthy SNR. So, ink-jet printed filters should be good enough. (The trick is to use .tif (not jpg) image files and print high resolution using dithering. I've built 'snap-in' attenuators for the cell-phone spectrometer housing this way. Also remember that the printed dot density is not perfectly linear with the image dot density since the printer is an approximation due to it's own dot-pitch.) You could print a 'film-strip' attenuator with continuous patch areas of increasing attenuation and then just slide the strip 'till you get the best intensity.
