[@stoft](/profile/stoft) hey Dave, well thank you for replying, I appreciate that. I said before, I have read ALL your work here, and I have learned from it also, I _do_ agree with a lot of your points you have raised, I know the terminology and the linguistics of research and science, I am a enormous proponent of the critical thinking process, I wish more people would utilize it.

"Wishing" is not a very good plan though, and neither I suppose is making vague statements when it comes to accuracy and precision, in that, I acquiesce. I should be more precise and clearer in my statements, like when I said that "9nm wasn't so bad." I need to put statements like that in context. Math, you are certainly right, it's always in math, key to the universe, it doesn't satisfy curiosity though, it's a means to a logical end, the fun part is the journey to get there.

Figure 1: Deuterium lamps offer significant light output across the UVC wavelengths while xenon flash lamps offer light at various wavelengths across a broad spectrum. LEDs are tunable and offer high light output at a specific wavelength required for measurement.

I whole hardly agree with you that the LEDs that I am using have a wide bandwith and thus pollute the data, I know, but the point is in the general research of the possibility of using a more cost effective and reliable light source, that can be tuned to the wavelength of interest. its the discovery that makes the scientific process exciting, it's not only the mathematics and the cold calculations that define me ( I'm just going to speak for myself,) it's in the "what if" its possible? What if using LEDs for certain uv-vis spectroscopy applications can work? I think its worth exploring the possibility. 

Jargon, does NOT a scientist make! Passion for one's work does, failure and success, synonymous with each other. 

So I really don't think I should just discount all the work I've done here at Plab, others may believe so, I do not, and I'm not going to just wait until I reach that "eureka" moment that may have taken me 365 days to attain, before posting my findings, its kind of like building a data base of knowledge and progression, just because everyone expects things to remain within protocol doesn't mean one cannot deviate once in a while. The data is still valid if the numbers line up? right? The method can be altered or adapted in other ways, no one is breaking the laws of physics or any universal principles. 

To bring this back to your original issue about me comparing my spectra against that of spectra gathered by a $25,000.00 piece of equipment, I lose, it IS in the getting closer that matters. I suppose then that, Thomas Edison should have just thrown in the towel after test # 2000 no? 

Of course not, I have a bigger picture in mind here, a spectrometer with a built in LED source that can be tuned to the appropriate wavelength that an individual wants, but I have to work within the parameters and monetary budget that I have and equipment that I can construct. That's what makes it fun, and if it becomes work, then I can't love it and I will soon lose interest, to me there is never a point in doing that which you hate.
