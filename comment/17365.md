Also note places to cross reference to look for industrial sites, also via Scott Eustis - [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) - of Gulf Restoration Network:


Justin, i did see it, but did get an error lately on your map
Harvey Ecological hazards

Landfills are importnt to track, especially < a month from now, when nasty new landfills will spring up.  we've got to be in communication with Lone Star Sierra Club about that, since i don't know how TCEQ will announce the new landfills. 

We at GRN made a similar map for our internal planning, but also for public consumption:

We pulled our data from Climate Central's report on EPA data.

Sierra Club has a good map of facilities in TX as well:

for pollution reports, Skytruth has an NRC tracker:
