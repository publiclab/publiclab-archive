Oh, quickly:  love the REST API idea!  Maybe for these really long technical documents that we host on github, we could add an "abstract.md" or "researchnote.md" file to the repo, which would have a standard format, and would be written as a nice, concise, accessible summary of the work.  As long as we're consistent with that format and approach going forward, we can take our time to think about building out the functionality to "push" that markdown file as a research note to Public Lab.  In the meantime, we can just enter the markdown 'manually' on publiclab.org, on whatever timeframe works best (maybe as a weekly or bi-weekly 'open water / riffle dev update' ritual) ...
