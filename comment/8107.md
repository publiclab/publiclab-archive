       Do you have a link to the Visualight schematics? I should check them out, as Jeff was hoping to use their more powerful LED, and we might be able to incorporate that onto this board ...

I was just going to use one of the files from the Visualight Github page- https://github.com/lpercifield/visualight/tree/rcgreen/Hardware.  But I haven't managed to get that far yet.  Is there not a usable schematic in that repo?

        The "Github for Hardware" (nice way of putting that!) is something that so many folks I've met have been interested in ... farmhack.net had something like that in their tools wiki ... and Upverter seems cool ... but one issue it seems is that there are so many design tools out there, and so many file formats -- and so many ideas for what would constitute a 'design' -- that it's hard to accomodate all of that in one platform. Frankly, I'm finding publiclab.org's research note + wiki approach to be a pretty good solution, in this regard -- it's a flexible and fast way of putting up notes around a design ... witnessed in this note and its comments! :) But it's great to think about what the ideal solution would be (and build it / or incorporate it into the publiclab.org platform) ...
 
 I recently came to the conclusion that the, in the end, the "Github for Hardware" may in fact best be achieved by using...well...Github for Hardware. So I tend to agree with your conclusion.  Unless you can convince everyone to agree on a common platform from the beginning, its probably best to emphasize flexibility and compatibility in a format.  Despite its heavy developer-jargon orientation, Github continues to offer the most flexibility from my POV.  The major weakness is in the wiki feature which remains buried underneath the main repo page.  So I agree that the present research note format might be the best way to do it.  I imagine it helps that comments are written in markdown too even if it requires me to brush up on my html.

     Idea: Rui's Squarewear design uses a bootloader he wrote that allows one to use the Arduino IDE on an Atmega328 without requiring an additional chip to handle USB. This means that one could conceivably use a through-hole Atmega328p, a through-hole RGB LED, and a through-hole coin cell holder ... basically, I think the entire design could be a through-hole, easy to solder kit. Would that be a good idea? Or do we think it's more important to be able to assemble a lot of these easily (a surface mount design would be better in that case) ....

This is a tough one...  I can see as many merits in such an approach as drawbacks.  Concerning the "through-hole vs surface mount" question I could see a lot of space between the flexibility of a breadboard and the permanence of a PCB.  For example, I just noticed Adafruit is selling something called a "Perma-Prota Breadboard PCB"- http://www.adafruit.com/products/1608 that could fill this gray area to a degree.  This could be especially useful for working with LEDs as it allows you to arrange them in any form.  However, once you start getting into High-Power LEDs like the Cree XLamps, I'd probably be  less inclined to trust my own ability to wire it safely.

The other question in my mind is whether or not it would be worth continuing with an ATmega328 even if it does have the ability to handle USB.  Again, I see as many merits as drawbacks in the 328 for which I outlined a few in the comment thread on this research note- http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/01-22-2014/thermal-flashlight-using-mlx90614-ir-evaluation-board-from-sparkfun
If one were to go with a through-hole soldering kit, the 328 seems to be a better choice, as in my experience the 328 has been much easier to program then the 32u4.  On the other hand...  a 328 might not be able to take advantage of some of the latest advances in cloud-sensor communications. The decisions of the Arduino manufacturers themselves might be a good indication of how these advances are unfolding. Not only has almost every new Arduino release since the Leonardo has been based on the 32u4, but when you look at their approach to the new Arduino "Yun" to their plans for the Beaglebone-like Arduino "Tre" to recent efforts towards making a web-based IDE, its not too difficult to see them moving in a more software-oriented direction.  I don't think it would be a stretch to see the move from the 328 to the 32u4 as a first step in this direction.
  So my oversimplified formula is that people from an electrical engineering background prefer the Arduino Uno while software developers tend to prefer the Leonardo.  My decidedly indecisive position on the merits of each approach is based in the fact that I am neither an expert in hardware or software...
