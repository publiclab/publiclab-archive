Continuing to use the same oscillator circuit for depth and conductivity is super awesome! I support whole heartedly. 

In the 555, pulse time in stable mode is equal to t=RC*ln(3), where R is in Ohms, and C in Farads.
assuming a minimum listenable frequency of 10,000hz, and a capacitance of 0.4nF (0.00000000004F), I calculate we'd need a 2275598Ω resistor, which is pretty close to  2.2MΩ.  That is a standard part! not bad.
