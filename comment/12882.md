Yes, I can post a picture of two cuvettes when I get back to the UK (after Dec. 8th). And yes, I'd like to learn more about the Raman scattering. Are you suggesting that the light was scattered - that there was a change in energy of a molecule due to a transition to another (usually higher) energy level - and that is what was captured and that it is because of the laser used?
