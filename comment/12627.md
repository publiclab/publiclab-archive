Also, I'm not clear what Hg II means -- an ion? Would we only be seeing Hg I, or would we see both? I'm wondering about the Hg I line at 546.0750nm vs. the Hg II line at 542.5253nm, which seems MUCH brighter, but that's not the case in the CFL spectra we see, or in Wikipedia's Ocean Optics example. Does that mean we aren't seeing any Hg II lines and I could filter those out of the NIST results?
