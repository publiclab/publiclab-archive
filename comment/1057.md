what this says, to me, is that height of the canisters is irrelevant in the conditions the test was in. 

that is the take away for matthew--we can capture all the variability without varying height. 

We might next try to vary the samples in time.

I think a 5 foot height most approximates a nose, yes?  let's just make all the samples human height going forward. 

i may check on that weather record, to see whether there was no wind.  perhaps, under more windy conditions, we would not see this result.
