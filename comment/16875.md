By comparing my spectra of the Sun (more lines for precise polinomial callibration) with that of the CFL lamp, I can confirm that the green line is almost certainly sodium 546.074. The other peak is at 541.68 and is probably Tb. 
Here is my spectrum:

And here is the data, if anyone is interested.

raw intensity:  1,3
calibrated intensity: 1,3/4*5
