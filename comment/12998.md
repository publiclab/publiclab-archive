Here is a Silhouette Studio (for the Cameo or Curio) .studio3 file which I cleaned up, and a DXF which properly imported into the Cameo.

This version was better -- it's on the left in the images below. But there are still issues:

* it's narrow enough to smootly/snugly fit in the box, but we had discussed actually having it free-standing to further structurally isolate the exterior box from the internals. Should I make it even smaller?
* the slit insert windows aren't at the right height
* the slit insert windows could be 1mm wider to be more snug
* the bottom tongue and slot are misaligned by about 1mm -- the slot should be 1mm closer to the edge

Finally, the box top tabs are a bit odd with it -- they either go inside the slit holder side flaps, where we'd have to place it completely up against the end of the box (top image, below), or they'd have to go outside, where they get caught on the slide-through tongues (bottom image). We could also ask folks to trim the box top tabs, in theory. Preferences?
