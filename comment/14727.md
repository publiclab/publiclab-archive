This is the first time I see kite photography and its quality exceeds the expectations I had. I thought only the drone is able to make high-quality photos from the sky with a GoPro but turns out the kite is the budget solution which can make us happy with some astounding photography. Sadly, we see forests being destroyed which means higher land pollution and more CO2 in the area which is really painful even for the reader, not to mention the people that have been displaced :( .
