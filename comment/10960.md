Thanks for the research details Amy !

Very useful.

Learning to "read the landscape" is fascinating.

The clues are all around us.

Here's another 1859 Map of the Cromer stream you just described, from David Rumsey's collection:

A good movie describing global research efforts on urban underground stream restoration is Lost Rivers - you can watch the trailer here:

The full movie describes similar holding tank scenarios in parks for Toronto Canada to help reduce pollution problems.

Tree canopy size is one of the "clues" we use for tracking "join the dots" paths for remapping the old stream beds in Brooklyn. I'm now also using the Aircasting sound recording app (http://aircasting.org/about) to record different stream sound levels at sewer plate covers. Will be posting more technical notes on that "ghost whisper" research as well.
