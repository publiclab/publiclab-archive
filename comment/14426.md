Thank all of you for the suggestions
Maybe it is the wrong strumentation but i don't know:

1) If I buy your http://store.publiclab.org/products/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0 can I make by myself reflectance spectra of some surface to use as calibration target? 

2) Is Desktop Spectrometry Kit 3.0 suitable to have reflectance spectras precise enough for my goals?

if http://store.publiclab.org/products/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0  were to be me fit, I could share here some reflectans spectras. 

Thanks a lot
