Progress. Right, the likely alignment issue is grating to camera which is notoriously hard to do without having much mechanical control beyond tape. Camera body and the slit are easier to align to the housing -- if both are rigid then the  grating becomes the primary variable.

Viewing the spectral image as side-to-side, that line of camera pixels will be 'vertical' in the camera with the grating lines 'horizontal' like the slit. So, the slit 'length' need not be very wide as it only contributes to a 'taller band' in the viewed spectral image. The most accurate spectral 'line-of-pixel' data will be aligned with the optical center of the camera lens. Nothing new here, just a target point for adjustment. With DVD 'gratings', it's important because even at the DVD edge, the grating lines are curved so the viewed spectral 'band' needs to be both 'centered' and have no offset angle.
