node: Why do raw RGB values differ from calibrated RGB values? I thought calibration just set pixels to wavelength (nm)?

Wow, doesn't it look like the calibrated values are losing precision? 

One thing I think is happening where you see the .95 decimals is that it's an artifact of the averaging -- I can dig up that code and we can likely come up with a better way to do it. Hang on!
