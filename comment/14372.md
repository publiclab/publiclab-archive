[@stoft](/profile/stoft) - ah ok, good, then were on the same page there. I guess the question is then 

* who can make such assessments
* how do we trust the assessments they make
* how does one express disagreement with an assessment
* what do the assessments look like and what are our guidelines for making them (we've made some progress on this in other threads too)
