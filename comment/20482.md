Just a quick update on the status of this project. Willow Creek is going through a couple of serious events. First, the stretch of the stream where it goes through Creede, CO is going through some major stream renovation.  Second, the drought in the area has resulted in a significant reduction in the stream flow. The latter is so significant that it is difficult to find accessible locations for the placement of sensors.  Hopefully as the rainfalls (local monsoon-like weather patterns) move in, the situation will improve.
