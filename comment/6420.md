Hi Pat, Chris,

Chris: it'd be good to grab any additional photos you have of the blimp -- we can post those in a research note soon, as well as details re: the seams and the rigging.

The cost of helium was $50 for an 80 cu ft tank (plus a $100 deposit); we went through a local supply company (Ivey Industries) that was able to provide helium with a few days' notice (and I think they would've provided it on yet shorter notice).  

Chris -- alas, my Garmin watch was in a box nearby, eager to fly, but forgotten by me.  Next time!

Re: GPS data -- I just grabbed these boards from Adafruit:  an RGB color sensor (http://www.adafruit.com/products/1334), as well as a sensor that has both full-spectrum and infrared diodes (http://learn.adafruit.com/tsl2561).  I also have a GPS breakout board (http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ultimate-gps).  Would it be useful for calibrating & geo-referencing these photos to have an Arduino-based prototype that e.g. records GPS as well as R,G,B, NIR sensor data?
