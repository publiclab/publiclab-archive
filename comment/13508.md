Ah, set as in SW set! Here is one with CFL spectra from you, me, stoft, and spectra4cps:  https://spectralworkbench.org/sets/3165. All of these show the two green peaks to be about 4nm apart. Included in this set is the recommended idealized spectrum [CLF_CFL Corrected SnowySky](https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/show2/58696). I never found any CFL spectra with the two green peaks closer together. But I didn't find CFL spectra with distinct green peaks from any other authors (there are too many to look through). Funny, when I use "Find Similar" on one of my CFL spectra, I find only my CFL spectra (IOW, from Ebert).
