Hi, [@cadreia](/profile/cadreia) - i did notice some of your screenshots show the Post editor rather than the Comment editor - just wanted to note that these are distinct codebases, and our focus is on the Comment editor. That said, i appreciate the thought of fixing other bugs if there is time!

Also noting -- there may be some overlap between the system test phase and the bugfixing phase - ideally, the process of writing thorough system tests will help you expose the bugs, and by solving the bugs, you'll complete and pass the tests. 

Thanks again!
