I have never seen wires like that, and they look awesome! I would love to give my kids the choice of which style of wires to use!

Also, these are the written instructions we used (courtesy of my friend and coworker, who also made the bottle cap probes).

If I were doing it again, I'd place the 555 chip for them, and leave it there to avoid damage, and adjust the instructions accordingly.
