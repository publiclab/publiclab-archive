This is a good topic and, IMHO, points to the heart of entire PLab hypothesis -- that reproducible scientific measurements are possible by a broad spectrum of users.

A few thoughts:
- The existing spectrometers can be mechanically reproduced - yet the mechanical results are variable (eg. alignment, ambient light, etc.)
- They have reproducible results (they show a spectrum) but results are not yet sufficiently reproducible beyond simple observations.
The important point is to investigate, identify, measure and then publish the real-world limits so that interpretation of collected data has a quantifiable value. This has yet to be done.

PLab published research notes also have a wide range of 'reproducibility' questions related to their content. For example:
- Reporting measurement results using "accepted" devices is largely just data collection so the larger issue is technique and the limits of the device as used.
- Notes about investigating a measurement limit, method, technique, etc. does increase the documentation requirement of the author and results and claims can beg review and more tests of reproducibility.

I agree that deciding about what needs further validation is not simple. However, I'd suggest that any research which proposes to change a boundary of what has, "in fact" (i.e. has been verified) been widely accepted as "known", needs verification. When one sets a spec for a device, it is necessary to sufficiently test so as to assure all users will get the same degree of measurement capability within that spec. If a new technique improves the results, that pushes the boundary so must be validated again -- reproducibility.
