[@liz](/profile/liz), right. A simplistic example is the 'tree' of the web site with one section being 'research'. It's fine to see 'new posts' listed (just labeled as such in bold) but then subsections of of research topics with material that has been 'filtered' so the reader, on going there, doesn't just find the same heard of cats that they find on the intro page -- though there could be an 'ancillary' subcategory of as-yet un-filtered material ... some of which may periodically moved to the 'filtered' spot. If I'm searching for how to map my neighborhood park, or accurately take a water sample, etc. I shouldn't have to wander though piles of unfiltered material and, especially, not know if what I'm reading has been "reviewed" in some form so I won't be randomly lead down some 'blind alley' ...... and, from an outside perspective, doing otherwise (or nothing) appears very unprofessional.
