So it is possible to use spectrometer as colorimeter.

Is it possible to choose to read narrow band of spectrum with Public lab spectrometer software? 

If I have understood correctly colorimeters work on some narrow area of electromagnetic spectrum that you can choose in some models and some has it predetermined. Different analyses need different area of spectrum because different solutions you get with chemical reactions that you do before analysis with colorimeter absorb different areas of electromagnetic spectrum.
