I wonder if there is a simpler map convention that would not take up as much vertical space -- could the label control have text next to it, or could we have it open by default?&nbsp;

> Appreciating this work more and more each day!  I just thought of a way to make it easier for people to know that there are layers to turn on, and wanted to share it as a possible goal!  Proposal: when the in-line map tag is used, it would not only add the map on the page as shown, but also above it, include a line of text saying, "to turn on environmental layers, click the icon in the top right!"  Maybe we could try a version which also said, "To learn about this project and give feedback, visit [link-to-this-post]"  If this line of text was present, when new people visit [https://publiclab.org/wiki/puerto-rico](https://publiclab.org/wiki/puerto-rico), they would see a map and be invited to click the icon at top right to turn on layers.
