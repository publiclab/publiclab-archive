[@warren](/profile/warren), Liz made me a co-author, but at the time the change I wanted to make wasn't related to your instructions for the terminal.

I'd like to propose a change which is to add something to step 7. 

**Context**: I had already pushed some commits and made a pull request after which I needed to make some more changes and push additional commits.  I re-followed your instructions which work perfectly except when you get to `git push origin add-map-tags`.

At this point I got the following error:

 needs to be `git push -f origin add-map-tags`.  If I just do the former I get the following error:
```
! [rejected] my-branch -> my-branch (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:user/plots2.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```
The solution detailed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39400690/6023530) of `git push -f origin my-branch` worked.  It seems like given the original S.O. question, this is because it was not my first push anymore?

**Proposed change:** 

Assuming that is the reason, add something to the effect of (in __*bold italics*__):

>After rebasing, Susan's local feature branch add-map-tags contains the latest version of plots2 with her new feature added on top. The new feature is ready  __*If this is Susan's first time pushing to this remote repository*__  she will use `git push origin add-map-tags`.  __*If Susan has previously pushed to this repository she will add*__ `-f` __*to the command like so,*__ `git push origin add-map-tags`.  __*Susan then submits*__  a pull request on GitHub from that to publiclab's master branch.
