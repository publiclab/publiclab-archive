so, how long will the sensor need to collect data for? If there is reliable power, and it's inside of a house, and it isn't running for weeks on end, couldn't a possible solution be to just pipe a serial stream into a text file? If there is a laptop available, that might be a faster easier solution than trying to rig up an SD card and Real Time Clock, etc for remote datalogging. I think most of the commonly used serial terminal softwares have that as a feature (I know CoolTerm can do it).
