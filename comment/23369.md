 chunbr, thanks for you interest. I apologize for missing your comment and questions, I have been exploring some new adaptations to this system that have significantly improved the usability. As for the excitation source at 90 degrees, it was made for a solitary LED to be pushed into that hole, the wire leads of the LED can then be pushed against the terminals of a battery to produce the excitation. This worked well on ethanol extracts of chlorophyll in the Amazon this past January, but the web interface for iOS was not working well so we were not able to produce spectra from the images. I have since developed a mount and case for a USB ELP 8MP camera I purchased on Amazon. The spectralworkbench works much better with this. I will post the files and a picture soon. Also, a weird side affect of the way I generated the STL files is that the parts were actually designed in inches, but the STL files "think" they are in mm. The scaling follows that conversion exactly. I am able to do this with a software feature in my 3D printing software from Makerbot.
