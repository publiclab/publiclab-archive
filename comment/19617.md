OK, revisions look good! As [@amirberagain](/profile/amirberagain) mentioned, maybe expanding your timeline/checklist a bit could help. I'd like to see an outline of how you plan to organize your code; maybe pointing at a well-organized library as an example? 

In JavaScript, we're trying for relatively short files, which are `require()`'ed together, and named consistently -- this tends to be good for other people to be able to quickly read through, find relevant parts, etc. Here's an example: https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/tree/master/src/

I'm not as familiar with Python but I imagine similar coding style could be achieved! If there's an example project you'd like to aspire to, structurally, please share! 

Once your GitHub repository is set up, I think a good step will be to make a planning issue there with the tasks you have in mind. See these examples: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/labels/planning

I hope this helps. Thank you very much [@MaggPi](/profile/MaggPi)!
