Sreyanth,

Good start at wrapping some descriptive boundaries around a tough project. However, after a bit of googling, it raised some questions I thought I'd pose.

It was not clear (to me, anyway) if you intended to treat a spectral plot as a graphical image -- therefore, the idea of using 2D image algorithms. Assuming this was the intent what 2D analysis techniques would you apply? This question is moot, of course, if this was not the intent at all.

It seems that both Opticks and Wang-Bovik are fundamentally written and tuned for 2D digital imagery -- generally photographic. The spectral data is inherently not 2D. Have you considered the tradeoff between the added complexity of those 2D algorithms vs something requiring significant effort just to port? i.e. the much simpler extraction of key parameters from plots -- no image processing needed.

From personal experience, I've found it useful to perform some basic experiments on some arbitrary or random sample data, using a familiar environment, to prove the concepts -- prior to the significant effort required to port code. Is this a possibility? What I didn't see in your notes were references to 'proof of concept'. It is often of advantage to first pick the tasks with the greatest risk (i.e. does a fundamental concept be made to work and come close to meeting basic requirements) before building the finished product. Maybe you're planning on this already?

Spectral Angle Mapping looks interesting, but it's capability and application is in the removal of multiple light sources from spectra of 2D earth imagery. I did not see a description of how those concepts might be applied to the current spectral plot matching/search concept. Are these concepts well formulated but just not yet annotated for the project?

I'm just posing some thoughts up front in hopes the question might be helpful and thereby achieve your goals and possibly save you some effort along the way.
