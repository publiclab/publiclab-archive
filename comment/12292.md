Hi again everybody.

I finally got around to posting the Cave Pearl Project on Hackaday, and realized that it turned out to be a pretty concise summary of the current state of the entire project. So I thought I would post a link to that here so that people don't have to wade through my entire blog if all they want is the "readers-digest" version:
