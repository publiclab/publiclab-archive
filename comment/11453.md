There's been a good parallel discussion of the need for this here: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/plots-spectrometry/ZtLXALzz4Us/F_nXP5sc6TgJ

I proposed that we start thinking (maybe in steps, or even pseudocode) about how to design a macro to accomplish this as a core function of Spectral Workbench. 

Dave has very helpfully created a Github issue for it too: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/issues/107

What would it look like, step by step?
