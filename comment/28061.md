Check out draeger tubes.  They used to be relatively inexpensive (~$200 per dozen, depending on the test).  That was ten years or so ago, so I don't know what they cost now. The tubes also require a calibrated pump.  That can be a calibrated hand pump or motor pump, etc.  The hand pump is the least expensive, but the calibration adds dramatically to the expense.
