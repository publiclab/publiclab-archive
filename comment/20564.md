aha, I guess I'm wondering if it's possible to just tape over the red LED -- but in future versions we can integrate that setting for sure -- we'll be using this library to generate new images for the spectrometer, so do you think you could open an issue for "disabling the LED" here?&nbsp;[https://github.com/publiclab/image-builder-rpi/issues](https://github.com/publiclab/image-builder-rpi/issues)

Google brings up a config edit that is supposed to disable the camera LED, but the fix isn't working for me (adding disable\_camera\_LED=1 to the boot config).
