[@souravirus](/profile/souravirus) can you kindly elaborate what you will be doing in each phase. We are having approxs 3 months and prior to that community bonding period. It will be better if you can divide your timeline week wise, so that it will modularise the project into small pieces for easy merges.
Thanks
