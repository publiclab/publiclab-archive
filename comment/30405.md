Camp Lejeune is a military base installed to honor General Lejeune, a general in the marines. Today we learned that the Clear Water Act of 1972 was set to remove pollutants from drinking water. A lawsuit was filed against Camp Lejeune for introducing dangerous chemicals such as Trichlorethylene into the drinking water resource.
