Wow, some really impressive detective work here, Richard! Kudos. 

I should be able to do a test with my phone and Chromebook but am still traveling. I wonder if an ask to the main Public Lab discussion list could be helpful, though it would probably require some more explanation of both how to contribute test data and what this whole project is about (a simple "what were trying to make possible" that'd appeal to Arduino users, maybe). What do you think? I like the idea of showing a simpler audio cable hookup and maybe even a short video to make the testing steps even easier?
