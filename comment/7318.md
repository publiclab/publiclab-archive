Agree 100% with castle's camera recommendations. We did highest ISO our little point and shoot had (1600), shutter priority, manual focus to infinity. 

Your biggest challenge, even in shutter priority mode, is movement of the camera. We did get some good imagery on the periphery of our map in areas  much darker than the football field, but we collected many that were blurred because of movement in just 2 mph winds. With perfectly calm conditions, a point and shoot could accomplish exactly what you're trying to do.
