Hmm, I think I need a username too?

To post formatted code, you can use four <code>`</code> characters -- <code>````</code> on lines before and after your code, and it'll display in a "code" block. 

````
// Like this!
````


You could also post it on https://gist.github.com and paste the link or embed in here.

Thanks, Ned!
