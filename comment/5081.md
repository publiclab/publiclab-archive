Hello cfastie!

I follow your job with interest, but there are a thing that I not understand well. You say "A filter can be used to block all red light, so that the only light captured in the camera's red channel is infrared. The blue channel captures normally, so NDVI is computed using the difference between the blue and red channels." But the NDVI is not defined as the difference between Red and NIR channels?

Thanks in advance for any clarification.
