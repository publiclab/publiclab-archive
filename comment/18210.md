<3<3<3 awesome -- you can clone [the whole Google doc](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-01-2017/collaboratively-write-the-new-pocket-guide-to-grassroots-mapping) or do it in InDesign or whatever -- i can help "bookletize" it -- was able to get it printing on a laser printer on 16 sheets of paper for a 64-page booklet that can be hand stapled and bound! I have a few of these handmade versions which are really nice.
