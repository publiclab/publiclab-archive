I did some reading on spectrometer designs and found what may have been my reason for not seeing the expected improvement by putting in the focusing lens (which was a focal length away from the slit and thus was also a collimating lens.) A standard spectrometer design has a slit---collimating lens----grating---imaging lens --- sensor array.  The purpose of the collimating lens is to ensure that all rays incident on the grating strike the grating at the same angle.  If the angle of incidence varies, then, an ideal, zero width line will actually be spread out over an angle equal to the differences in angles of incidence.  Thus, even if the focus of the webcam lens is adjusted so that the slit is in focus, there will still be line spread due to the different angles of incidence on the grating.  Now we need to know how much of the grating the webcam lens "sees" in order to calculate the range of incidence angles for the vhs box or the conduit box.

Now back to why I did not see an improvement in resolution using a collimating lens; I did not pay much attention to making sure that the optical axis of the collimating lens was aligned with the light path through the spectrometer, so the collimating lens was probably not not creating the desired effect of ensuring a constant angle of incidence across the grating.

For a low cost, easy to make spectrometer the incorporation of a collimating lens is probably out of the question, but comparing spectra made using different distances of slit to webcam is probably worth some examination.
