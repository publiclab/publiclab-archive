I hate to say it, but it looks like your laser peak at 499 nm looks like it was truncated, meaning that your fluorescence intensity is 25% of what your detector will measure, not 25% of the laser line.  Perhaps it would be better to compare the fluorescence to the second order image that shows up at 200 nm? 
Why the gel cap?  The round shape is going to make it nearly impossible to get reproducible light path.  Why not use standard fluorescence cuvettes?  You can get 100 of them for $20 here: http://www.amazon.com/Disposable-Vis-Fluorometer-Cuvette-100pcs/dp/B005YOX53Q/ref=pd_sim_sbs_indust_6?ie=UTF8&refRID=02G4HYZN7YVDMEWCK9VK
