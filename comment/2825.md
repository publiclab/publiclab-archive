Babu,

The new camera is going to be very fun to use. It would be interesting to see a histogram for each channel from an image like that one. We can hypothesize that any data in the green channel is NIR light plus a little red, and any data in the blue channel is mostly NIR. The data in the red channel will include a mix of red and NIR. So:

<strong>Channel</strong>.......    <strong>Data recorded</strong>
Blue.............              NIR
Green...........           NIR (plus some red)
Red .............              Red plus NIR

What you don't have is a channel that is mostly red with no NIR. And you need that to compute NDVI.  Or you could use a channel that is mostly blue because blue is absorbed by healthy vegetation just as red is, but you don't have that either.

It might seem logical to compute a red channel by subtracting the blue channel from the red channel. So: 

(red + NIR) - NIR = red

It makes no sense to me that this would work.  

But you can test whether it does or not. Find a simple scene with healthy plants, some other green things that are not plants, and some non-green non-plants. Take a photo with your new super blue camera and also with a similar unmodified camera.  The two photos should be precise repeats. Then calculate NDVI in two ways. First do the above math to compute a red channel and compute NDVI using that as red and the blue channel as NIR. Then compute NDVI using the same blue channel as NIR and the red channel from the unmodified camera as red.  This requires that you register the two images so the red channel from the unmodified camera matches the channels from the super blue camera.  If the two versions of NDVI are similar, you have good reason to believe that subtraction can produce a computed red channel.
