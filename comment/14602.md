Hi [@bhickman](/profile/bhickman), this is great. Other folks (mostly [@donblair](/profile/donblair)) have been working on developing a turbidity sensor too. I have a couple of questions with your set up: (1) What wavelengths of light are you emitting and detecting? (2) Would the photodiode and amplifier you're using be compatible with the Riffle data logger? I'm not finding the latest research note on the Riffle, but maybe [@donblair](/profile/donblair) or [@mathew](/profile/mathew) could point you toward it or would know if it would be compatible. Thoughts? Also, what sort of price range is your LED and photodiode set? Thanks!
