This is looking great. Maybe the "digest" work could include things like:

* a row of small links or buttons under each item like "follow `tagname`" "ask a question" to encourage engagement
* a row of tiny bio pic thumbnails next to some of the "leading topics" for the digest time period, to show the different people involved?

Reply by email is going to be a big one. That can also be broken up, maybe --

* what about posting a new topic? Maybe each email also has a link that says "post to this thread" or "ask a question" and leads to a post page pre-populated with the relevant tags like https://publiclab.org/post?tags=tagname or https://publiclab.org/questions/new?tags=tagname

The digest could say "12 items posted on 4 tags you follow" -- and then offer "related topics" to follow as well, so people can expand their subscriptions.

One final thing -- a big one, perhaps towards the end if you have time -- what about using ActiveJob to fetch tweet responses and enable "reply by tweet" as well? Not sure how this would work, but then maybe you'd see a twitter icon instead of a comment balloon, and it'd link to the tweet that was copied in? 

Great start to this proposal, thank you!!
