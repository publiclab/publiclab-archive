    I'm using formula ndvi= Nir-Vis/Nir+Vis
The formula for NDVI is NDVI=(Nir-Vis)/(Nir+Vis)

    Vis= Blue channel Nir= red channel
With a red filter, the blue channel will be mostly NIR and the red channel will be mostly red (with some NIR).

The computed NDVI values will be between -1 and +1. I don't know what the options are in Visual Studio for displaying those values. To make an 8 bit grayscale image, the values could be scaled between 0 and 255. A grayscale image can have just one channel. To make a color image, you have to know how Visual Studio makes a color image when each pixel has only one value (NDVI). Maybe a look up table?
