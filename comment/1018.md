Hi, Leeuwenstein - I recommend you don't yet use the mobile spectrometer (which is experimental) but the desktop version: 

http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/video-spectrometer

Once you have built it, you can follow instructions here:

http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/spectral-workbench-usage

They are a little out of date but will be updated soon and mostly work fine. Calibration info is here:

http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/spectral-workbench-calibration

Good luck, spectrally analyzing gemstones sounds very interesting. You might try using an ultraviolet light. 

In general, you'll find a lot of info and data on:

https://spectralworkbench.org
