Also if you have a resistor you could test the idea bc a potentiometer is an adjustable resistor, if that's helpful.&nbsp;

This information is really helpful, and gives a way forward. I will dig through my boxes of extra parts and find a potentiometer, maybe also a battery case for a 9v battery, then remake this circuit.
