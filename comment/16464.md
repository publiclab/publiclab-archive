I have just been going through a peer reviewed journal paper named 'Monitoring plant condition and phenology using infrared sensitive consumer grade digital cameras' by Wiebe Nijland et al 2013 and their conclusion stated on using a red -rejection dual band-pass filter ( ie. blue, green and infrared sensitivity ) for largely overcoming the poor band separation.
Any ideas for the available dual band pass filters at our public labs. I am planning to buy a 6 mm security lens mobius action cam with such available dual band pass filters. Please give suggestions
