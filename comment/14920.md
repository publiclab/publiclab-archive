Nice model. Thanks for doing that. There is plenty of room for nuts now. I don't know how changing the angle will affect function. I would have to print it and try it out. 

The angled brackets are shorter now which compromises the friction hold on the dowel legs. There is also much less plastic between the two angled brackets and on either side of them, so it will be more vulnerable to delaminating along printed layers. In fact, the approach should probably be (instead of building it from two tubes) to start with a solid block and then remove the path for the two legs. We need as much plastic as possible to strengthen those angled brackets. The only space that should not be solid is where the four nuts have to fit. Those are very small nuts, so it does not require very much space around the holes.

Thanks,
Chris
