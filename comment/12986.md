Thanks, that's helpful . Yes, it is possible to operate two PI cameras from one Pi (though I'm still sorting through the debate/speculation about the best way to do that), so simultaneous triggers should be possible. The NOIR camera comes with a Roscolux [#2007](/n/2007) Storaro Blue gel, I'm not sure how that compares to the Wratten 87, but any gel can be installed. So, if I understand correctly,your suggestion is to use a standard PiCam but add a Wratten 25A filter (while leaving the pre-installed IR filter in place) and also use a NOIR camera with a Wratten 87 ... then take a series of simultaneous pictures and process them using Ned Horning's plugin. Once I have the calibrated NDVI images, I can then make a time lapse or process them in some way to make a quantitative comparison (perhaps playing around with the techniques described in the video to see what might work? .... or maybe overlaying the images in Gimp with partial opacity?). I'm not sure if there would be a systematic approach to trying to amplify the small differences in color that (hopefully) would accumulate in each image in the series or if it would just be a matter of trial and error using Gimp. Do you know if there is a reference somewhere where I can learn more about calibrating using targets of known VIS and NIR reflectance?  Thanks again.
