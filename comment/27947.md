That is great! I don't know about a timeframe. The draft permit for renewal is not available yet. We were told it would be up for public comment soon, but it is already five years passed expiration. So any help would be great! All we have right now is the current permit (attached).

There is a new construction permit that can be found online at https://opc.deq.state.ms.us/ensearchonline/ai-info/2299.  I do plan to submit a public records request soon for the application and other important documents, such as their deviation reports.
