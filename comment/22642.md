OK, I found some promising links-
https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA21964
This link includes an example inset of part of San Juan. Not as granular as the NOAA photographs, still, looks helpful.

Much more detailed files available for download. I hope they've gotten to the western half of the island by now.
"Files: https://aria-share.jpl.nasa.gov/events/201709-Hurricane_Maria/
These satellite images have likely damaged areas marked. The files can be download as png (not too helpful, file < MB) , a 21.7 MB HE5 file, or multiple geotiff files, which have, by far, the most data.
Text that accompanies geotiff files:
  "ARIA Damage Proxy Map v0.4

The Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis (ARIA) team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and Caltech, also in Pasadena, created this Damage Proxy Map (DPM) depicting areas of Eastern Puerto Rico that are likely damaged (shown by red and yellow pixels) as a result of Hurricane Maria (Category 4 at landfall in Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, 2017). The map is derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the Copernicus Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites, operated by the European Space Agency (ESA). The images were taken before (Mar. 25, 2017) and after (Sept. 21, 2017) the landfall of the storm.

The map covers an area of 169 by 96 kilometers. Each pixel measures about 30 meters across. The color variation from yellow to red indicates increasingly more significant ground surface change. Preliminary validation was done by comparing the anecdotal reports of damage. This damage proxy map should be used as guidance to identify damaged areas, and may be less reliable over vegetated areas and flooded areas. Sentinel-1 data were accessed through the Copernicus Open Access Hub. The image contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2017), processed by ESA and analyzed by the NASA-JPL/Caltech ARIA team. This research was carried out at JPL under a contract with NASA.
