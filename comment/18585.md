Hi jeff, that's almost correct. Talking to Jackie Z from Witness, she told they're discontinuing the CameraV project and focusing on the Proofmode. Except for the encrypted storage it works the same way in relation to the pgp signing the sensors data added a pictures metadata. The advantages are that it's really lightweight and always working on the background. You take pictures with your regular camera and then, if you want, you can share them with or without the metadata and the hash in a sidecar file. Pretty awesome combining with RAW pictures ;)
