 The "repro" mentioned in the report is short for reprocessing.  This plastic ha s seen a lot of heat and is much more likely to break down. Hence the report recommendation to stop the factory operation.

The highest extruder temp used in the plants I 'm familiar with is about 420 f.  The 500 f limit on the report ( suggesting the plant ran at higher temps) was a surprise. 

One chemical to keep an eye on is methylene chloride ( also called dichloromethane).  It was detected, but not on the Aluf roof.  This chemical is often used as a polymer solvent and is pretty nasty.  There are many other sources besides polymers, but please keep your eyes open for this one.  It is also heavier than air.
