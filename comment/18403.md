I have never met a conductivity meter that doesn't have some amount of drift.

Having said that, the commercial conductivity meter at work was a low level a.c. Generator ( don't remember the freq, but I think it was high audio) feeding a wheatstone bridge.  The conductivity cell was one "leg" of the bridge.  An a.c. Voltmeter read the voltage differences between each leg of the Whitestone bridge.  The resistance of the other leg of the bridge ( the one without the cell) was then adjusted until the voltage was zero.  From here, the water conductivity could be calculated.

 Because the voltage was a.c. and low, there were no electrolysis problems.  Drift problems... Yes still some of those.

Maybe this is the circuit you are talking about?
