Hi [@francesco49](/profile/francesco49) -- just wondering if you've been able to get your camera up and running! If you give us a little more info about your setup we might be able to help you find the right settings. You're also welcome to join us on our Open Call (most Tuesdays at 3pm ET) if you'd like to chat by phone or video!
