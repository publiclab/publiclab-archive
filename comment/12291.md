Hi Pat! I have these very cheap and light 18" mylar balloons, and was wondering if two of them would lift a mobius. Obvious advantages:

* fits in car or subway
* stays inflated for a week or more
* less helium
* cheaper balloons - <$2 each
* redundancy if one pops

Would you be willing to try them out if I mail them to you?
