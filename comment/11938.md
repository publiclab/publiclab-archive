We don't currently use matches in MK, but the very initial thing I was going to suggest is to simply visually link the currently selected (or dragging) image's interest points with their matches in nearby images, with very fine yellow lines. This would also potentially reduce the search space for matches -- submit a request just for the current image and any nearby images. 

The idea for checksums as unique ids was that I'm not sure how standard interest point descriptors are -- but if there's a way to get and store the interest point description itself from the request, pair finding could be done on the MK end, in the client-side, for efficiency. 

That is, we wouldn't have to re-generate interest points, but could store them in the image objects, and do local pair-finding. 

It'd be especially nice if, in addition, interest point descriptors were standard across algorithms, and interest points could be stored in image metadata too, making future matches faster... but I think IPs can be calculated with different methods, so that probably won't work.
