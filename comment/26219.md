Dear biozanco,
I've only just started to review the Public Lab entries on NDVI images and how they are produced. Yesterday, I received four separate e-mail notifications, one for each message you sent. When I log in to these messages, they appear to consist solely of images from one set you presumably acquired. Was there some narrative text you intended for me to make sense of the images? Or is it just to demonstrate to me one set of such images generated? I'm sorry, but I don't understand the meaning of your collective message at this time.

Sincerely,
lev29
