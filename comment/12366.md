 I assume by "computer" you mean "arduino/microcontroller" unless I gave the impression that I was going for a swim with my laptop?  In any case, I did some searching and found that the ds18b20's are often used for marine temperature monitoring where their low cost and chainability allows them to be deployed en-masse. 

See here-http://waihinga.ac.nz/foss/university-of-ngakuta/logtemp.htm

and there's lots of research on this blog- https://edwardmallon.wordpress.com/

 I can only imagine what calibration must be like in such a scenario!  In any case, I've seen no mention of any disortion caused by depth/pressure.  There does appear to be some question regarding how well the housing will hold up in a marine environment but such cases involve long strings of the sensors laid out like fishing gear.  I was only planning to have the very end of the sensor exposed beyond the sensor pod housing within the Glider's nose-cone.

Don't get me wrong though, I'm not about to go and buy a ds18b20 T-shirt or anything...  My past experience with them has involved more frustration then anything else...  But again this had more to do with the software aspect...
