Thanks for sharing this [@warren](/profile/warren)! I had planned on starting work on the layer chooser menu by next week. Showing information on data validity and reliability for each layer is a great idea! This definitely needs some planning. I shall begin to collect information on all layers this week to plan where the details should go into the UI and share my progress.
