Hey Guillaume851, yeah, I have been using spekwin32 for several months now and once you start getting the hang of it it is easy to use and very effective for data editing and analysis. Yes it was free, although you do have a choice if you want to use it commercially, but that was costly and really I didn't need to do that, I do this as a private researcher so I just requested the free license, no problem. I hope this research helps because I know it certainly helps me, and I love the fact that there are so many of us here that working and collaborating together, I think that's pretty cool.

Have a good one!
