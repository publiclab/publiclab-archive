Thanks [@nanocastro](/profile/nanocastro) - I would be very happy to see your documentation in Spanish or English, we'd very much like to trial the system where there is no WiFi, so Bluetooth to the SD would be excellent way forward for us; just need to think about a long term power supply, or consider a small PV cell with dual battery system with a switch between the two systems.
