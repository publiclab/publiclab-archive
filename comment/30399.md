The Clean Water Act was created in 1972. Its purpose is to prevent chemicals and other negative things in our water supply. We need this act because having dangerous chemicals and waste in our water can cause different cancers. Marines that resided in Camp Lejeune suffered from bad water effects because they drank supposedly safe water. It had a lot of carcinogenic harms. Now there is a lawsuit going on to compensate the marines and their families affected by this.
