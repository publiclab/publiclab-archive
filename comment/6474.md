Thanks cfastie, I still think I can do a better job though, getting the focus and resolution even better. Glad to see the line near 538 nm line appears in your spectra too. Perhaps the other lines are real after all. Now that I got the hang of the basics I will try and imrove the image, will do some research on how professional equipment works. Thanks for commenting!
