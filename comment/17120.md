1) tried to load image for header. Tried both drag-drop and up-load. Both sorta worked, but image was severely cropped to the point of being useless.  Finally gave up. 2) Wrote up some overall goals as well as more detailed discussion of purpose and limitations of replication. This was (I think) Item 3 of 4.  Unable to publish. Tried to edit Tags with no luck. Then the form emptied. Completely. Blank.
