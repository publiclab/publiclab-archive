Yeah, i agree that having a more regular mobius lens would improve stitching. Liz has recently done a bunch of fisheye NIr maps, and may also have opinions 

What rig setup did you use?  I liked the solo cup idea that was posted a while back. 

I am using the soda bottle rig, but bolting the Mobius into the plastic, because the orientation of the camera body is not the best for the rubber band setup
