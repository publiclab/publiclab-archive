Hey friends!  I've been very busy with work lately, so it's taken some time for me to get back here.

Fernando:  My webcam seems to go down to around 375ish.  AFAIK, most webcams don't include any sort of intentional UV filter, because the sensor isn't too sensitive in the UV range, though the lens may well block some of it that the sensor would otherwise pick up.  A pinhole camera might be able to pick up more.  It might also be worth studying the properties of the sensors used in various cameras.  I know some are more sensitive to IR than others, it may be the same case for UV.  As for the source I'm using, it's one of these:  http://www.batteryjunction.com/p60-uv-buld.html.  If you're interested in it, I can tell you what you'll need to set it up, it's a "P60-style dropin".  A 3D printer sounds like a lot if fun!  You'll have to show us some of your creations!    As for the DVD messing with the UV, if you're worried about that, I agree with Warren that a dedicated diffraction grating is a good option, and I think you could find one relatively cheap.  With the spectral workbench software, it uses video in[ut, but you also have the option to upload an image straight to the site without using the capture software (this would mean more work for you to prepare the image on your own).

Minh:  AFAIK, there is no "normalize" function in Excel.  You have to do it in several steps, and you can follow the outline I gave above (in the comment on Sept 4th).  If you'd like some help figuring out exactly how to make Excel do that, let me know and I'd be glad to give you some tips.
