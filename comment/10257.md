This is most excellent.  I especially like how accessible audio analysis is.  [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/) is a great FOSS system for doing audio analysis, has built-in network collaboration functionality, and applications can be run [through the browser and on android and iOS](http://puredata.info/downloads/by-category/distribution), and maybe edited (in development).
