 Hi, Ed; thanks for reporting this; we'll take a look ASAP. I've opened an issue for you here if you'd like to provide any other information (for example a sample image): https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/4617

I've confirmed that the "choose one" link doesn't seem to be working. You can drag and drop an image in, however, and that should work.
