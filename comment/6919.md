Yeah, i think it's spambots. I looked through the logs and saw 89 requests for this page from one IP; i'm sure a lot of the others are similar, esp. if they are just scripts and don't run JavaScript, which would have made them register on GA. 

One good way to check out IPs for spamminess is to look them up at Project Honeypot: https://www.projecthoneypot.org/ip_91.121.5.17 (although they seem to be having some uptime issues right now) I found the following IPs from a quick search through recent log entries, and took notes on some:

91.121.5.17 - spammer: https://www.projecthoneypot.org/ip_91.121.5.17
198.204.237.107 - Kansas city high school
199.15.233.134 - spammer: https://www.projecthoneypot.org/ip_199.15.233.133
175.44.54.103
71.254.4.168
