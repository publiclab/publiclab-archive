Ally,
It is the kite that should be flying at least 100 feet high before you attach the camera rig to the line. The camera can be attached to the line directly below a balloon, although it can help to send the balloon up first without camera to be sure there is not too much wind up there. It's always important to fly the kite for a while before attaching the camera to determine if the wind is suitable.

Have you figured out why the RGB camera did not record photos?
