Hi - Using 440nm seem reasonable but I'd probably increase the NIR value to 760nm or beyond or something like that since the peak is probably beyond 740nm. That's just a guess since the graph is cut off. As far as advice for selecting calibration targets you could test the material you suggest - assuming you have access to a spectrometer. The best targets will have relatively flat reflectance curves (reflectance for all wavelengths are similar) but that can be difficult. In your case it would be best if the reflectance curve was flat in the NIR wavelengths since we don't know where the peak is. It's also good if the calibration target is not very sensitive to specular reflection. It's better if the light is reflected diffusely - equally in all direction.
