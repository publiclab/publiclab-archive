It looks to me like both offer pretty good differentiation, but that the red filtered version depresses NDVI values. But since we're not assuming absolute intensity calibration here, the relative data is still useful -- but it might be a bit confusing if folks are looking specifically for positive NDVI. 

It's too bad we don't have the originals to experiment with. 

I wonder if there's some standard coefficient we could add to the red-filtered ones based on a more structured test, perhaps following Ned's absolute calibration methods. If the coefficient were consistent (i.e. if red filtering consistently reduces NDVI by a factor or a fixed amount), we could just add that as a variant of the red filtered preset, just for use with the webcams.
