Thanks for breaking this into small parts! Remember: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-18-2018/software-outreach-modularity-is-great-for-collaboration

I wanted to point to this unfinished PR:

https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/1832

And this example of upgrading to Rails 4.1: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/1799

See how the existing 4.2 one has a kind of checklist of things that have to be completed to merge the changes?

I also wonder what (of the above list) could be done in preparation for Rails 5 but would still run on Rails 4.x -- so we could do that in advance before switching the gems over, and merge it into the main branch before having to totally commit to Rails 5, you know?

Thanks a lot!!!

I also wanted to suggest that this is a big synchronous project where many changes would happen in a single PR, so not as modular as other possible projects. If you wanted to explore other options, there are some promising issues or ideas in https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/milestones! But you've done some good work breaking this up!
