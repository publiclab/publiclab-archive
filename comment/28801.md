PROGRESS REPORT!

Summary:
As a class, we created a master plan to address our issue.
Representatives from our class volunteered to photograph water hyacinth in different areas surrounding the New Orleans area.  We used Google Earth to identify and display the locations where we took photographs. We analyzed and displayed the data using Google Slides.  We had a group research on the Internet to find background information on water hyacinth.  We had a separate group of students collaborate to propose solutions to this problem.

Here is our background information on water hyacinth:

- The water hyacinth is banned from the UK garden ponds.
- Water hyacinth's scientific name is Pontederia Crassipes. 
- Native to South America in the Amazon basin.
- Pontederia crassipes is a floating perennial aquatic plant and may occur in dense mats with new plantlets attached to floating green stolons.
- Water hyacinths are one of the fastest growing aquatic plants and can quadruple in size a single month.
- This plant forms a dense floating carpet on ponds, lakes, and bayous that blocks sunlight.
- Each floating plant has dense, fibrous, branching roots that may extend for 2-3 feet beneath each plant, and a rhizome to start a new plant.
- Water Hyacinth grows profusely, forming dense mats that can spread across water surfaces eventually choking the entire water body.
Water hyacinth causes oxygen levels to decline, which causes many fish to die.
- Water hyacinth usually is around the warm climates and that is where they show up.
- Lives in freshwater areas.
- Water hyacinths do not grow where the average salinity is greater than 15% of that of seawater.
- Water hyacinth currently has no natural predators in North America. 
- Water hyacinth needs hot summer temperatures but can live through the winter.
*** Dangers of Water Hyacinth
- One reason why they are dangerous is because they can cover a whole pond and stop the water flow. 
- Another reason why theyâ€™re dangerous is that they can destroy native wetlands and waterways and kill native fish and other wildlife.
*** Uses of Water Hyacinth
- Water Hyacinth is an excellent source of biomass
- When the growth of the plants can be strictly controlled, water hyacinth may be useful in purifying water, by filtering out excessive toxins and limiting algae

Proposed Solutions:
- We could release Neochetina beetles into the area which would eat the WH. These beetles are known to eat the water hyacinth weed and removing and in a large group, they can remove the weed fast
 
- The easiest way to remove the invasive species would be to go out on a boat and  go near the shore and use a rake or some type of tool that can reach far out so we can easily remove it. 

- We could take a chemical(Glyphosate) and use that on the WH. This chemical is a safe chemical used to kill water like weeds. It would be a helpful way to kill the weed without damaging anything else.
