There is one more issue to be aware of. In addition to automatic exposure, most simple cameras have automatic white balance. Automatic white balance can adjust the relative brightness of the three color channels (to make photos look normal regardless of ambient light color). So if you are comparing two photos or spectra of different lamps to learn about lamp color, you must make sure the camera's white balance algorithm did not alter the color balance differently for each photo. This might not be possible with most webcams.
