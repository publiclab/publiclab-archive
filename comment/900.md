I'd like to see  [good bit of the introduction to NDVI](/wiki/ndvi-plots-ir-camera-kit), a quick note on hacking the cameras accompanied by [this image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffreywarren/6854399226/in/photostream), and something on [interpreting images](/wiki/interpreting-infrared-images)-- which doesn't seem complete.

that should be enough to explain the process and spark interest, we can then point people back to our site if they really want to build the tool, with a teaser about mounting cameras and dual camera triggering.
