I'm not an expert on the EPA. But I do have extensive experience in the medical device field.  In the USP ( United States pharmacopeia), timelines like this are not uncommon.  

For exeample, N-nitrosoamine testing, in the medical device field, was done on a gc/tea (thermal energy analyzer), at least up to 2008.  There was always debate about whether it or gc/ms was better.  Probably, gc/ms/ms is much better, but much more expensive.
