Hello! A good place to start would be the [Hydrogen Sulfide wiki page](https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide), it is the place where we've organized the research on H2S at Public Lab. There's also [this great post](https://publiclab.org/notes/megan/9-6-2012/putting-together-h2s-test-kit) from [@Megan](/profile/Megan) on putting together an H2S sensing kit, and [a recording of an Open Hour about H2S monitoring](https://publiclab.org/wiki/openhour-archive#January+8:+Exploratory+hydrogen+sulfide+monitoring+methods). Below the recording you can also find notes from the call which have some useful links as well.
