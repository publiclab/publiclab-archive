Hi gretchengehrke, thanks. To answer you questions: (1) I'm using this [LED](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/honeywell-sensing-and-productivity-solutions/SE5470-004/480-1984-ND/679395) and this [photodarling](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/honeywell-sensing-and-productivity-solutions/SD3410-002/480-5622-ND/2513149) as the detector. The LED has a maximum output at 880 nm and the photodarlington has a maximum sensitivity at the same wavelength range. Currently the LED is $6.15 and the photodarlington is $6.45. (2) I'm not sure what the Riffle data logger is able to read, but the output of the sensor is a simple analog signal who's range can be adjusted by the amplifier board.
