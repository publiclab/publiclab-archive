Yes, I'd agree that time averaging would help and, if possible, it sould be the default to reduce this noise component. I do not have 30 fps data, only 6 fps data, but I suspect the noise likely looks Gaussian at any frame rate. Assuming that is true, then it does become a question of the number of captures for how ever long that takes. The impact is that the user would need to keep their system, and test configuration, constant for that period to assure the smallest DC drift. (This again points to the need for mechanical stability.) As for the number of data points ... the running average of 31 points (~5 sec at 6 fps) reduced the noise distribution by about half but the effect is not linear. I'll think more about extracting a curve to show the trade-off, but having to take data for a few seconds seems likely.
