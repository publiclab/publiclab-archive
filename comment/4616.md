Hi, Nick - did you fly kites at all? Usually I won't fly balloons in anything but perfectly calm weather. What kind of camera hanging system did you use? I think some adjustments to your camera hanging system could help stabilize things and let you get good photos even in high winds. 

Very cool work!
