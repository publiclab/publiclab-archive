I guess I can't guarantee they didn't leak a bit, but in my experience the rice sticks to the side of the bottle if there is moisture.  I'm not sure if that applies after the water has been sitting in the rice for a week.

I'll take a look at the silicone tape.  The silicone sealant is messy and I wonder if I can use the tape as packing around the wires.
