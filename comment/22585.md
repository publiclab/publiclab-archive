Remote mapping support through Open Street Map (OSM) has my vote. Mapping buildings and roads after a disaster supports first responders on the ground who may or may not be from the affected area. And first responders/locals in an affected area often lose their bearings on what was there due to the trauma experienced after the disaster.
