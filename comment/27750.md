One more to add! "[Guidebook for Developing a Community Air Monitoring
Network: Steps, Lessons, and Recommendations from the
Imperial County Community Air Monitoring Project.](https://trackingcalifornia.org/cms/file/imperial-air-project/guidebook)" 

With a focus on particulate matter monitoring, the comprehensive guide spans community engagement, choosing hardware and software, siting monitors, and analyzing data.
