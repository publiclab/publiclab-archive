"vertical" checkbox (of SpectralWorkbench upload page) checked in the three tests.

Now, rotating and cutting the test 1 image, I did two uploads with:

[![2016-01-25_16_29_21.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/823/medium/2016-01-25_16_29_21.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/823/original/2016-01-25_16_29_21.jpg)

- Test 4

[![20160123_215541_a.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/825/medium/20160123_215541_a.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/825/original/20160123_215541_a.jpg)

... result

[![2016-01-25_16_30_36.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/826/medium/2016-01-25_16_30_36.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/826/original/2016-01-25_16_30_36.jpg)

- Test 5

[![20160123_215541_b.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/827/medium/20160123_215541_b.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/827/original/20160123_215541_b.jpg)

... result

[![2016-01-25_16_32_30.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/828/medium/2016-01-25_16_32_30.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/828/original/2016-01-25_16_32_30.jpg)

...see You that the result of B2 and G2 should be close to 435.83nm and 546.07nm, but these are my results:

Test 4: B2 = 1198.37nm and G2 = 1599.49nm

Test 5: B2 = 113.13nm and G2 = 514.11nm

I think I can get two conclusions, that is, I have two variables influencing my results:

The score remains the same regardless of the length of the image. Maybe the DVD I used is not appropriate for the spectral kit 3.

The length of the image modifies the wavelength. I'm in trouble with the dimensions.

I bought "Diffraction Gratings 1000 line/mm" but not yet received.
