Hi [@nickyname](/profile/nickyname) sorry for the delay! you can use many different size pots for this from about 6 inches to 18ish inches. In out kits we use 9.6 ounces of activated carbon, but that amount is not due to an exact science and is for a 9ish inch pot. 

Hi [@stevie](/profile/stevie), that's a great question! I was just thinking about this myself. I think I would allow an hour for this although it would almost definitely take less than that (maybe 30 minutes?). The thing that takes the most time is washing the plant roots, and that a maximum of 10 minutes.

Christophe is going to be posting our newest version in a research note soon, so the steps will change slightly very soon.
