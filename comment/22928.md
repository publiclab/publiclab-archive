Moving some text from the [#particle-sensing](/tag/particle-sensing) page by [@DavidMack](/profile/DavidMack) -- thanks, David! Trying to consolidate some scattered info on this across the site but i'm linking back here from each place. 

> * [The Speck uses a  Syhitech DSM501A](/notes/chrisbartley/04-15-2014/speck-particle-monitor) for **[~$2 in quantity](https://apollosense.en.alibaba.com/product/834915677-218449778/Dust_sensor_DSM501A_for_IAQ_monitor.html#!)** (thanks [@chrisbartley](/profile/chrisbartley) !)
> * [The Dustduino](/notes/Schroyer/11-23-2013/measure-coarse-and-fine-air-particulates-with-a-dustduino) Uses a [Shenyei PPD42NS](/Willie/04-01-2014/field-testing-the-shenyei-pm-sensor) **available for ~$25**.
> * [Here](http://www.sharpsma.com/webfm_send/1488) is a technical sheet for a **$12.25** particle sensor by Sharp that can be purchased from [here](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/GP2Y1010AU0F/425-2068-ND/720164).  The Sharp product works by detecting IR radiation that is scattered off the particles.  The sensor outputs a voltage that is reported to be proportional to the concentration of particulates in the air.  I have not seen code for this, but it looks like it would be pretty straight forward to write.

Also note there are [drivers for Arduino](https://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/06-01-2015/plan-for-recording-shinyei-optical-sensors-using-open-pipe-kit) (see the comments!) + Raspberry Pi are available for the following devices:

* ThermoFisher PDR 1500 - [#11927](/n/11927)
* Dylos - [#dylos](/tag/dylos) & [#11927](/n/11927)
* Shinyei particle sensor - [#shinyei](/tag/shinyei) & [#11927](/n/11927)
* [DustDuino](/dustduino) (using the Shinyei sensor mentioned above)
