Ideally, the user would select a "stable" ('smooth' or 'broad peak') region to monitor and then the software would take samples (and average) while monitoring stability (low DC drift) and notify the user when the measurement is done -- or timed out with an unstable result. This is how most instruments work which are dealing with measurement drift. Just defaulting to blind measurements for 5 sec MIGHT give better results, but if the user is causing drift with an unstable setup, then the result is only an average of a lot of noise and gives a false indication of stability. The actual stability must be measured to be able to tell the user it was, in fact, stable. Actually, this basic measurement (even without the averaging) should be a mandatory part of SWB.
