Sorry, are you getting multiple post errors? It's weird, it's never happened to me so I'm not sure how to debug it. Any help documenting the problem would be great.

As to a consistent white material, i've heard that Teflon is pretty good (from some spectral engineers here in Boston). I wonder if a patch of white teflon is easy enough to get our hands on.

The other spectrum could be a pure black-body source (isn't a tungsten lamp this?) because i think those are supposed to be easy to model/predict, no?
