The automated output results in a nice image, or evan great. 

I could analyze it critically; it does have errors, the original image sharpness is lost, there are areas where things are blended that should not be to support seamless transitions and make the image appear as one sole composite coverage when its not. And there is this whole concept of the human factor in grassrootsmapping that is partially lost when the cartography is outsourced. 

But at the same time, I would consider it a good result. 

I think this technique should not replace the existing manual workflow (not speaking about forever but in the "now" certainly), but can totally exist as a separate workflow for those that are either not interested in making maps by hand, or would like to outsource the job to software for any number of reasons. It seems like the folks at conservation drones are only looking at this solution.

It would be fun to have a Kasparov-esque people vs. machines showdown. But I remain steadfast on the value of the human element in making these maps. I just don't see it as a nut that is yet to be cracked.

I hope I do not sound discouraging. I just propose that people consider this methodology as separate today (who knows how people like me will evaluate this in the future). There is something very good there, no doubt. I just am not ready to see it as the inevitable "goal" of what we are working towards. And I do think that you are making a real contribution for others as you work towards finding an automated mapping solution and document the efforts as you have done here. 

Thanks Pat!
