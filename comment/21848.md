 Hello Everyone. I am happy to see everyone is so enthusiastic. I am Himanshu Dewan and i am currently an undergrad student at University Of Delhi and  I am also looking for GSoC'2019 opportunity . My idea is that we should: <br>
<strong>1. Develop a PWA</strong> <br>
PWA will be a small project and it will add  native app like experience . We can use BrowserSyn and WebNotification API . We can use WorkBox that will provide workflow for the project. <br>
<strong>2. Migrate to Front End Framework to create a SPA(Single Page Application)</strong><br>
I personally vote to go with react or vue as they are easy to pick up. Although we will have to create lots and lots of API. <br>
<strong>3. GraphQL </strong><br>
For creating API we should use GraphQL as this will me more useful to manipulate and access the json data we will need for our frontend and native app.
