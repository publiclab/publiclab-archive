It sounds like Warren answered the question.  I can give some more background.

Proteins contain nitrogen, which isn't present in many other milk compounds.  This nitrogen is often used to track the milk proteins.  The earliest method I used was kjeldahl.  Don't try this method unless you want to swear. 

A number of other methods have been developed including some base on near infra-red NIR.  Most of them are looking for casein.

Good luck with your project.  Our district science fair is in late March.
