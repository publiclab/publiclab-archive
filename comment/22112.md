 On pcbs (it's the chlorine part I 'm worried about, here), whenever you put a chlorine containing material in a flame, the flame should turn green.  It's not that the color can't be masked or interfered with. It can.  Hi levels of sodium, for example, turn the flame so yellow that the green isn't noticed.  One item to keep an eye on if this type of test is used.

An other type of test used with chloride and turbidimeters is a silver test.  You mix the extract solution with silver nitrate.  If chloride is present, silver chloride will precipitate out.  You can then measure this with turbidity.  Interferences are common.

In both of these cases, the polychlorinated biphenyls  must be converted to chloride somehow.
