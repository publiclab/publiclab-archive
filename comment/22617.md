[Adding coordinates ](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/mouse-position/)to a Mapbox GL map is pretty straight forward. 

Not sure that Mapbox GL supports permalinks, but then again I might be misunderstanding [this exchange](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-directions/issues/132).

I did find a [permalink solution for Leaflet](http://mlevans.com/leaflet-hash/), but I think you'd have to do something like [this](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-leaflet) which probably defeats the whole purpose of Mapbox GL.

Getting the NOAA data in there is a step beyond me. 

If somebody wants to point me to a repo for this map, I'll add the coordinates code.
