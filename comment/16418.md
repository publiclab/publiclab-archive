Updated the note with the flow of data diagram. Hope it helps in visualizing the flow of data to and from the bot. Please feel free to voice your concerns about the diagram and the bot in general. 

[@warren](/profile/warren): Regarding your concerns with the diagram:  
1. From User, here I mean the user interacting to the bot directly. Users would obviously interact to the bot through Github, but user actions on Github and Publiclab.org would seldom "trigger" some action on the bots' part. Atleast that's what I have in mind until now, although everything is subject to discussion and change.  
2. Concerning which all actions would be required by the bot on each of these interfaces would depend highly on the use cases we put to work. The bot might or might not be required to post research notes, for instance. It would all depend on what the feature we're working on "requires" the bot to do.

Thanks
