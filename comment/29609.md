For a couple other reads, look up "The Effect of pH on Color Behaviour of Brassica oleracea Anthocyanin" in Journal of Applied Sciencies, volume 11(13):2406-2410,2411.  They use a colorimeter based on human vision, so the coordinate system may not be familiar.  But it is valid.  Another quick and simple prep method is scienceprojectlab.com/red-cabbage-indicator.html.  I was hoping these could be used as titration indicators.  That usually means storing in the solution phase for at least a month.  The liquid form does not appear to be stable. Although the"Applied Science" paper did have a dried form ( probably purchased).
