 Thank you Lisdahl,

I will try to find smaller flow cells that are easier to clean. I use a green LED and a photodiode BPW21 for the detector part. I can see that your Z cells are interesting but I do not see how to make one ... I had already found that oceanoptics had material for the fia interesting.
I would do the same thing for the coils: I would just use rolled up tube.

I abuse your kindness.
I use small independent peristaltic pumps
https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/32823805412.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27426c374pYfUh
with flexible tubes of 1.5mm internal diameter I get flow rates of 1.5ml / min and it's quite stable. I can electronically adjust the speed and go down to 0.75 ml / min.
At the moment I test only NO2 sample to calibrate the device (without reduction column), I use the same flow for the two pumps: 1) NO2 sample and 2) Griess reagent.

a) I do not know if the pumps are a problem. I was advised to use piezoelectric pumps?

b) Is the relative flow rate between the sample and the reagent very sensitive? (1.5ml / min) Is an identical flow rate satisfactory or does it require a higher flow rate for the reagent to saturate the reaction?
c) I have a small question of chemistry. When I'll use the Cadmium reduction column, what is the buffer solution for?

Thanks in advance,
Christophe
