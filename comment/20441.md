Hi [@amayas](/profile/amayas) , sorry for the delay! It looks like the app used in the post that you linked to is something called MSpec-- that  post comes from a community member, so I don't know too much about the app they're using. We use something called [Spectral Workbench](https://spectralworkbench.org/) with the Public Lab spectrometers,  -- this is actually a web based tool, which you can use with your smartphone camera (if using a foldable spectrometer) or any USB camera. There's a lot more information about the spectrometers and the software that we use over on our [Spectrometry Wiki](https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry).
