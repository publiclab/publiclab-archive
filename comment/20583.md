[@pdhixenbaugh](/profile/pdhixenbaugh) If I understand your comment correctly, that is exactly the point I am trying to make. Perhaps, we need to create our own AQI index if I am indeed misusing it. But the relevant information is that the federal reference methods that the EPA uses, often does not really identify the length of time people are exposed to moderate/bad air since the air is averaged over an entire day, thus flattening out any several hour spikes that you may have experienced that day. Meanwhile, [research has well characterized](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3440112/) that long term exposure to moderate/bad air has more adverse health affects than short term exposure. It is important to understand this long term exposure.
