Yes [@warren](/profile/warren) . This is quite interesting and the satellite methodology approach would be more precise in mapping. I would be happy to explore more once I am getting my hands more dirt with Mapknitter first.

With respect to the place I live in, Lakes, treemap, vegetation could be mapped with satellite images and also keep informed both people & govt. to devise an action plan.
