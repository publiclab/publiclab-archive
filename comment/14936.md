I really liked this note too! I'm interested in how this dataset could be used as a "test set" for software development as well. There are a range of software packages (and methods [using only Photoshop or Gimp](/notes/warren/10-27-2011/video-tutorial-creating-false-color-ndvi-aerial-wetlands-imagery)) to do NDVI colormaps, and this is a great, well-documented and well-controlled set that could be used to validate the software procedures different packages use. 

Thanks for posting such a great and clear note!
