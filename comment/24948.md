Hi [@molangmuir10](/profile/molangmuir10) üëç 

It is quite tough to measure Area of land from Aerial photos I guess as the Area is calculated based on the distance between 2-4 points of a particular location.
So, we can use Google Maps for the location, measure the area, then place the image on the exact location with the calculated area.

Check this link for reference. It's quite easy to calculate Area in Google Maps with the default option in the Adress area. ( https://publiclab.org/notes/silentsairam/05-20-2019/increase-in-human-death-space )

With photos, normally the shape of any photo could be square, rectangle, etc. So the area might not vary if you measure area with photos.
