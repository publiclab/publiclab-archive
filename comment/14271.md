Awesome! I did some sketches for a multiple piece outside enclosure that could be prototyped in cardboard but final cuts in laser cut acrylic:

Long bolts would go across and hold it together, and it could enclose the existing spectrometer design (this has benefits for being more consistent with existing data, and being essentially an add on for the existing manufactured design, so people could upgrade). The internal stability is another question your and [@stoft](/profile/stoft)'s designs might get at. [@tonyc](/profile/tonyc) and I had chatted a bit about this but you're moving faster than we are! Thanks!
