So just finally circling back here; I'm happy to post step-by-step photos and to put notes on all existing Coqui docs if we are pretty much OK with the smaller board. For me, the [#1](/n/1) reason is actually that so far I haven't been able to simplify the larger board... strange but the smaller board seems actually simpler. [@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2) if you would be willing to Fritzing the diagram, I can photo the build steps and we can post a new revision of the board with these.

What I'd like to propose is posting a "response" to this, and then adding a notice at the top of each Coqui-related page that links to this latest version, to try to get all the docs across the site synced (but without deleting old versions). How does this sound?

Thanks, everyone!
