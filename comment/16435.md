[@warren](/profile/warren) - Yeah, I thought so too. I was thinking of taking up the "Email notification overhaul" along with this. Also, as I was going through previous open pull requests, I saw a lot of open ones on the last time's topic of "Internationalization of Publiclab.org". They're short tasks and could be a great addition to the current proposal.

I would like to take that up too alongside these. Do tell me if it's okay.

Thank you!
