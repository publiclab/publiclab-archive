It will always be difficult to know for sure to what degree the red channel is contaminated by NIR. It might be worthwhile making an estimate. For example you could assume that the amount of NIR contaminating the red channel is equal to twice the brightness of the blue channel. Or you could just reduce the value in the red channel by 30% or 40% and see how the results look. When you find a procedure that gives reasonable results under certain conditions, you can repeat that procedure in similar conditions and make qualitative comparisons.

Such estimates of the contamination might seem arbitrary and hard to defend, but you have already made an arbitrary adjustment by doing a custom white balance using a colored card (of unknown spectral reflectance) illuminated by daylight (of unknown spectral quality). Without a rigorous calibration procedure (e.g., using calibration targets of known spectral reflectivity), there is very little that is defensible in this type of NDVI process unless your results are compared with some independent information about the relative photosynthetic activity in different parts of an image.
