It seems like the red is cooler, since the beaches and shallow water of Jamaica Bay are that lighter yellow color, and they should be warm spots.

That means that the red spot is a cool spot. It is a channel there by the jetty, so it is a little trough of deeper water. The tide seems to be running out by the plume reaching out into the Atlantic. Perhaps that trough contains some cooler water that is being stirred up by the outgoing tide?
