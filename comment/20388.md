Ah I was hoping to have a fix on the line breaks before I share back with the group asking about this, no luck yet! But:: 

I think they're interested in using the data collected from people who get their personal home wells tested by the state. The home owners own the data (and the state?)- like you mentioned. But _I believe_ they're interested in sharing and showing results from people who willingly get their water tested, and then submit their data to a public database. Just trying to see here if anyone knows of groups who are doing this - exploring what it might look like, what challenges they might run into.  They're trying to get more granular on environmental exposures, I believe in this instance related to large scale farming operations.
