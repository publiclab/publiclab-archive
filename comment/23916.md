Hi! I created that image (with input from many others at&nbsp;[https://publiclab.org/contributors/ndvi](https://publiclab.org/contributors/ndvi)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[https://publiclab.org/contributors/infragram](https://publiclab.org/contributors/infragram)) and you're free to use it if you attribute with: "CC-BY-SA Public Lab Contributors" -- you can link to [https://publiclab.org/licenses](https://publiclab.org/licenses) too, if you like! Thank you!
