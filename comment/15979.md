thanks [@warren](/profile/warren), 

that post (pdf of field calibrations) is the reason we changed the sampletime to 3600000ms (1h) as this guys have tested its in hourly messures when Shinyei PPD42 takes similar values to comercial/more expensive dustmeters, will read all this again, its a lot of info and maybe i've missed something...

At this point the only mistery is what value should the pots have, testing two sensors toguether they messure up and down at the same rate but they will not messure the same concentration at the same pot position, i'm sure theres a fixed value for both resistors  where they will measure "more correctly" or more alike a comercial/more expensive meter.

We've arranged an station to test this days and see if we can find this value comparing with the local station we talk above, it would be awesome to have access to a more expensive meter to test this (we are working on that), or if someone working with Shinyei PPD42 has calibrated and could tell us the resistors value....

thanks again ;)
