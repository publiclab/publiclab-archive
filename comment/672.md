So one reason i forwarded this is that I hear that some NRDA technical people were using PLOTS balloons to do get aerials.  Whether those aerials where then legally admissible is not known.   so y'all may have trained them.   

I've also been interested in SAV in Florida, in particular, since most of it in the other Gulf States is dead.  There is some SAV left in the Chandeleurs, i need to look for it in the PLOTS Chandeleurs map.  So i'm very interested in guidelines for good SAV photography, and how to identify SAV from photography.   

This data is under ligitation blackout, so, i will email you some contacts you can follow up with.  when i get some time....er
