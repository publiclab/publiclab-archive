Hi [@indy](/profile/indy) if you're based in Indiana, as your name hints, you can report your symptoms to the stat DOH and they might come out and test for free. Indiana is the only state in the country that does that! Otherwise, you could try: http://homeaircheck.com/products/ or http://www.acsbadge.com/formaldehyde.shtml if the results are high we can talk about how to put together a low-cost formaldehyde remediation kit https://publiclab.org/notes/nshapiro/09-26-2016/build-a-plant-based-air-purifier (sorry for the delay!)
