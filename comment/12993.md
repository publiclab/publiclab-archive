Ok, so if I understand you correctly, using a standard PiCam with the IR filter un-removed and a Wratten 25A filter added to the PiCam, while taking simultaneous pictures with a NoIR Camera containing a Wratten 87 filter (and then processing the pairs using the Fuji plugin) would probably be worth a try?
