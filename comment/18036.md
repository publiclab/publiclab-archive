Hi Adam,   

Those thermoelectric fans are very smart. This [guy on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLn7bGzxJGs) shows how to make one with a [$3.00 thermoelectric module](https://www.ebay.com/itm/TEC1-12706-12V-60W-Heatsink-Thermoelectric-Cooler-Cooling-Peltier-Plate-Module/182906505245) and parts recycled from old computers.

I would try that but my inset stove has no room on top for anything.
