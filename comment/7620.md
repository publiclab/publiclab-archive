Note to self: found possibly-suitable boxes: http://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-12694BL/Retail-Boxes/9-x-6-1-2-x-2-3-4-Black-Colored-Mailers?model=S-12694BL&RootChecked=yes

9" x 6 1/2" x 2 3/4", black, $0.21 each. I guess we should look for foam blocks too, now, or some kind of rigid black lasercut thing to fold up to hold the sample containers in place.
