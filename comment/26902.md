Thanks for sharing. I think the most beautiful part is that people, who are not scientists or engineers but the common stakeholder in the air we breath can get involved. I make these PM monitors, but there is no involvement of the people in taking the measurement, neither in processing the data and other stuff. They are reduced to consumers of data. Thanks for writing in detail. Would love to build a system here in Pune, India.
