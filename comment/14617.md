Ben,

Fantastic job on this!  Excellent descriptions of the entire system -- the electronics, the probe design, and the calibration procedure.  Very, very inspiring.

The ability to switch known resistors into the measurement circuit in order to check for drift is a very clever approach, and would be particularly useful for a field-based sensor.  

What AC frequency are you using?  I've come to understand that 10 kHz might be a nice frequency for standard conductivity measurements, but am eager to hear your reasoning for whatever frequency you're using ... new to electrochemistry, myself. 

Also: in the end, what voltage ends up being applied across the probe?  I believe that one would like to keep the voltage significantly below 1 Volt, in order to avoid electrochemical reactions.  It might be obvious from the circuit, but I'll dig in ...

Thanks for this!
