We also used graphite furnace AA, also called GFAA.  One common analytical instrument is ICP (inductively coupled plasma).  I've used them a couple of times.  The instruments were large, at the time 4ft x 4ft x 4 ft ( that's been a while ago, so I'm sure they are smaller now) and used a lot and power.  The company I was visiting had a special power line just for the ICP, because of the high power requirements.  There are two common kinds of detectors, optical emission (  OE) and mass spec (MS).  That's been a while ago, so the instrument size and power requirements should be lower, now.  That's just to give an idea of what some of the instruments can use.  The GFAA used a 220 line, was much less expensive and smaller than the ICP, but didn't have the same resolution.  Oh well.
