I've been re-reading a bunch of entries to re-familiarize myself with the NIR camera and a rather simple question about this plume occurred to me which is: what properties of this plume are causing it to be identified?  Plants make clear sense since they reflect near infrared light, but my understanding from the write up about it in Tech President is that it's a flow of water, so why would this plume be visible in NIR?
