Journal Entry 1: I was about the leave out of the house to go somewhere with my mom. I opened the door and there were cigarette buds in front of the door and in the lawn. They either came from my sibling or neighbor. There are multiple manufacturing companies around the world that make cigarette filters. Cigarette buds are many from a man-made plastic called cellulose acetate. Over 18 billion cigarette buds are littered everyday. The cigarette bus were on the ground because of careless people in my neighborhood.
