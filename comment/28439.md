Thank you for sharing your ideas [@govindgoel](/profile/govindgoel), I have some feedback or comments:

1. For the first point under _Resolving HTML parsing issues_ please expound more, is what is currently happening related to not detecting an HTML attribute? Are you able to share the code that is not doing this?

2. In the images shared from the _Potential Fixes Needed: Header_ it would be better to describe what each screenshot is and what is happening in each screenshot, I had difficulties understanding which one represents the CSS issues or pointing them out.

3. Are there screenshots or images you'll be uploading under this point  _Page to recruit translators_ It was difficult to understand what this statement meant without the preview _(This is a preview of a prototype for the page) Below are the changes that will be done as part of the project -_

Also, consider looking at the Public Lab style guide as you create the preview https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/05-07-2019/introducing-a-draft-style-guide-for-public-lab

5. I did not see you address this point _we need an additional "guide" on the process of importing translations from Transifex,_ in your project proposal from the issue description https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/#internationalization

Some things you could consider, whether accessibility features are needed, will you create first-timer issues from your project to welcome new users?

Thanks again for sharing your proposal, all the best!
