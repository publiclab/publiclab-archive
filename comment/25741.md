Gwen Ottinger ([who is a member of Public Lab's board of Directors](https://publiclab.org/wiki/board/)) mentions the UV Hound in her book [Refining Expertise: How Responsible Engineers Subvert Environmental Justice Challenges](https://books.google.com/books?id=6N7HPKe9iZUC&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=UV+Hound&source=bl&ots=fOqKaRkEm9&sig=ACfU3U34cTyVDnImcyT-u4ZElIWnIEAyiw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRgJK0sK3lAhUirlkKHe_iChc4ChDoATALegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=UV%20Hound&f=false).. I've linked to the pages in Google Books if you want to see the relevant pages). She talks about it in relationship to the buckets used by the Bucket Brigade (her opinion on the buckets is quite favorable).
