Hi, Caroline!!

I agree with Chris - though if you're looking to download data (either as you go or once you're done) to a phone easily, you might consider using WebJack, which involves adding a headset jack to an Arduino so that you can transfer data using sounds (like an old modem). 

https://publiclab.org/wiki/webjack

So you could either just record continuously (though that'd run your phone battery pretty hard) or you could use a [data logger](/wiki/data-logging) like Chris points to, and then transfer to your phone by pressing a button to "play back" the data. Of course you could also just copy off the SD card, but since you requested connection directly to phone, this might be an option. 

But it does seem that iPhones won't be able to do this until the fall, when they finally adopt the WebRTC feature that makes this kind of audio connection possible.
