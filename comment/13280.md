I took another batch of photos (research note soon) with ISO 200 and the shutter speed at 1/30 second. The f-stop varied between f/2 and f/5.6. It was an overcast day at the winter solstice, so about as dark as you would ever want to take this type of photo. The camera was on a tripod, so image quality was okay. Even on a bright day in summer, handheld photos with the dichroic filters will require some care. Aerial photos will be a challenge, but at ISO 1600 you might be able to use a shutter speed of 1/400 second. ISO 1600 will introduce scads of noise if the camera is a point and shoot, but if your goal is NDVI, that might not matter so much. Color balance might also be affected by ISO 1600 and that could impact NDVI results.

A shutter speed of 1/400 could produce acceptable aerial photos if the camera was lofted by a kite on the perfect wind, or by a balloon on the perfect non-wind. So aerial photos with these dichroic filters is possible, but everything has to be in your favor and image quality will always be greatly compromised compared to other filters (e.g., Wratten 25).
