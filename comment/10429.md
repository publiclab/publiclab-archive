Here is an interesting connection with Stephanie Duce in Geoscience Department of Sydney University. She uses kites to map reef island beaches and try to assess change in the beach over time. Mitch Bryson, who she works with, uses structure from motion algorithms to create a digital elevation model of the beaches. His paper is attached here. Maybe it has some additional techniques?
