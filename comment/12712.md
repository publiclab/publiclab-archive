Wanted to see how it would work with battery back included. Mocked up battery pack using a marker of approx. weight, and made little "legs" using ziptie material and rubber bands. Gave the legs some shape, so it could press itself against one side of the bottle.

Here it is in position.

And here it is holding itself up, above the Riffle rig. You can slop these around pretty vigorously without the two smacking into each other.

Of course, if still, the batteries will serve as ballast and settle on the "bottom."

It seems easy to retrieve the battery unit and then the riffle unit without tangling anything.

For a test I want to mail this thing to Don and see if it's still working. :)
