Thanks, Craig! Great feedback. 

For the "interests" we want to be sure not to pigeonhole people as "scientists" "activists" as PL is all about building bridges across. So the idea of a collection of "interests" derives a bit from work [@liz](/profile/liz) is doing on [#evaluation](/tag/evaluation) -- and related a bit to the idea that people "walk in the door" with skills, interests, projects, questions, etc -- see [#13886](/n/13886) -- rather than with set "roles".

So, interests could be, like, "making something" "testing something out" "documenting a problem" "telling a story" "finding collaborators" -- or maybe a bit more general than that? 

But it's a nebulous idea so far. Happy to hear input on this specifically!
