Yes, it can.  You need to go to the spectrometer page for more information.  It will show how to set up cuvette s to hold water and what to use as a light source.  Then you need to go to the spectrometry page.  You will need to learn to use spectralworkbench, but there are many examples of different colored water samples in the library.  There are help videos showing how to use the software.

The old way to learn color was Roy G. Biv ( red orange yellow green blue indigo violet).  You can see this in the picture taken by the diffraction grating.  But it will be a good way to teach.  Sorry for the delay answering.
