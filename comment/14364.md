I found this section really interesting and reflective of some of the balance we're seeking here too:

Origins of peer review in 1800s: "Most fundamentally, they argued about what a reader's report ought to be. Whewell wanted to spread word of the discovery and to place it in the bigger picture. “I do not think the office of reporters ought to be to criticize particular passages of a paper but to shew its place,” he told Lubbock. If they picked out flaws, he warned, authors would be put off. Lubbock had other priorities: “I do not see how we can pass over grievous errors,” he wrote."

For my part, I don't think we need to debate whether to do peer review at all, rather how we adapt ideas from journal-based peer review into a more open source and empirically-based environment which could depend less on credentialed forms of authority for rigor and credibility. 

A tough problem!
