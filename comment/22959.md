We got ours from Amscope: http://www.amscope.com/4x-100x-four-achromatic-objective-lens-set.html#product_tabs_description_tabbed.   20mm RMS-thread mounting size.  (I'm not sure what RMS-thread is, but I'd assume it's standard).   And really, the thread mounting doesn't really matter, because we're screwing it into a 3D printed piece with no threads.
