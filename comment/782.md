Great progress, very cool. One way to share circuit diagrams in a very legible way is to create them in Fritzing, a free, open source circuit design program, and to post labelled screenshots along with a list of parts (including component values). A very thorough documentation (probably once the design is more mature, but whenever) might include links and prices for where to purchase the parts. This kind of documentation has been used at http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/thermal-photography to great effect.

Keep up the great work!
