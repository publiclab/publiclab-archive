the poor implementation of the UVC specification is baffling, I agree.  
Exposure control isn't really of any use.  controlling exposure also doesn't stop the camera's internal process from adding non-linearities either. We picked hardware with the hope of adding features to the software, but haven't yet. GUVCview has no equivalent in windows or on mac.  linux is the only platform exposure control seems to matter on. There is a package for exposure control that works on ma (linked to in my comment above) but it is mediocre and often crashes the capture software.
