Hi [@EdMallon](/profile/EdMallon) -- this is so great! I was just scrolling through all of the updates on here, and was wondering if you had any interest in turning this research note into a Wiki page, where people could follow along and try to replicate if they were interested and you could share your progress as activities or research notes (I see that you are already generating that content over on your own site aready). You can see a nice example of how a tool wiki goes together over at http://publiclab.org/coqui . I'd be happy to help set that up with you if you like!
