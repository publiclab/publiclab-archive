Yes, this is addressed in the upcoming version, however integration with the broader site will take a while. In the meantime you can use the demo in the issue here!

> Limiting the input to SW-V2 to 256 pixels, ignores the advances made in camera sensor technologies. Are there plans to rectify this deficiency as we now have camera sensors greater than 8,13.5 and greater to improve the spectral perfomance of SW . There also have been advances made in camera opyics as used previously. s tef
