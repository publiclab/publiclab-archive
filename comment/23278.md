Laser scattering based PM sensor  has tendency to show inaccuracy in particle between 2.5-10 um in size. Since Purple air as per specification i see is based on laser light scattering.
Its mainly because, the laser light scattered after particle at given wavelength range (e.g 640 nm wavelength based laser are commonly used ). This results particle size near by this wavelength for e.g 1 micron size particle can be measured accurately . Technically , because of MIE scattering principle .
Near laser light wavelength you will get more accuracy in particle size measurement and as you  go for from laser wavelength, the accuracy in size measurement will decrease.   
Apart from this Relative humidity and sampling inlet design also influence the PM measurement .
