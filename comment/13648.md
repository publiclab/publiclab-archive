Thanks Warren, I'll start from scratch and try a fresh calibration. I'll be stuck in meeting purgatory for the next couple hours, but I'll jump back in this afternoon. We're having an open house on Saturday the 27th in my science building, and I'm giving a spectrometry demonstration. I cut 50 of the foldable mini spectrometers out of black card stock, and I want to have Spectral Workbench up on the giant monitor for the demonstration. I have a week and a half to become an expert. I'll also have an Ocean Optics spectroscope set up, with cuvettes of different solutions.
