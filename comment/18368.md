Hi [shanlter](shanlter), that's great! I know folks have been excited to the [KnowFlow](https://publiclab.org/wiki/knowflow) evolving. Now that the riffles have been sent out and more people are using them, it might be possible to post questions about working with the riffle (or even other kinds of dataloggers) on the [Q/A](https://publiclab.org/questions) board. I bet that other people would be interested in how you're trying to make that work as well. Thanks for posting, we'll follow up more soon!
