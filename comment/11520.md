Hi abaker. Sorry for the delay, I was out in the field doing work for my real job... For you earlier question, so far I have been printing in PLA, although I would like to get one in ABS eventually. For the GUI code I'll try and make an instructional video, but for now you will need Processsing. Once you have downloaded the latest version of Processing there are a few external libraries that need to be installed. They are ControllP5, which can be imported directly in Processing by going to Sketch->Import Library; Graphica downloaded here (https://github.com/jagracar/grafica); and PFrame download here (https://github.com/shigeodayo/PFrame). There are instructions out there on how to add a library to Processing, but if you have any trouble let me know. After you have Processing and the needed libraries, its just a matter of downloading all the files from (https://github.com/SmokyMountainScientific/WheeTrometer_3.0/tree/master/Processing_Code/WheeTrometer_3_0_GUI) into one folder. Then opening WheeTrometer_3_0_GUI.pde with processing, the other files will open as separate tabs. Again, if you have any trouble, just let me know.
