I'm working on some activities for calibrating and deploying the [MiniVol](https://publiclab.org/wiki/minivol#how+is+the+MiniVol+used?).

I posted my activities as a works-in-progress, because I had a two-step process:

1. turn the manual's out-of-order instructions into step-by-step instructions
2. follow the manual's instructions, identify gaps, and document with images

My intention was to model activity replication and improvement by replicating my own activity (step 1) with improvements (step 2).  Doing this, however, has left me with a messy-looking activity in the grid. It isn't clear which activity should be followed, the original Activity or the Replication. 

I have a few more activities to update with images and notes.  I could skip the replication stage and just go edit my original Activity post.  This would give me a cleaner activity grid, but I don't like this option for a few reasons:

Only I can edit the original activity, so I'm not modeling a process others can join. There's no clear path for someone else who wants to improve my original activity to indicate they've replicated and improved it.

Research notes have no revision history.  It's not clear what I changed and why. Imagine that someone had followed my instructions and posted a Replication.  Based on issues encountered through replication, I edit the original Activity.  It isn't clear what their Replication is referencing now. 

My original Activity notes from the manual are more 'canonical' to the manufacturer/EPA instructions, and changes away from those instructions, while useful to actually getting the task done, could lead to drift over time.  That drift should be traceable. Decisions made in one revision should be reversible later, either through a record of replications/improvements or a wiki-style revision history.
