I occasionally run an indoor stationary air quality sensor that continuously collects data on fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and one of my go-to first steps is to plot PM measurement against time. This graph helps me see any initial trends or patterns in how PM measurements change over time. It also illustrates potential problems with the data, like unexpected gaps in data or unusually high/low measurements.
