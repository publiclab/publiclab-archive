[@bronwen](/profile/bronwen), We can only use black ink on colored paper. Good question about the file type... I think i might need to make it in this company's online postcard drawing software, which basically looks like Paint to me, but I'm not sure. I'll ask our PI about "come to your neighborhood" versus "knock on doors." I think we do want to specifically prepare people for two strangers knocking on their door... I'll ask though.
