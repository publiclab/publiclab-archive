We have been hoping that it would be possible to do this in post processing. Put the 18% gray card (or some other card) in the scene and take the photos. Then make an adjustment to all of the pixels so that the color balance of the gray card pixels meet some specification. 

When we do a custom white balance of an Infragram camera by pointing it at a blue paper or red paper, the camera adjusts so that a photo of that colored paper is colorless, like a gray card ([some tests](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/07-17-2013/balancing-act)). We could try the reverse, put a gray card in the scene, then adjust the entire photo so that the card is some specified color.

Ned Horning has been working on [another approach to calibrating the photos](http://publiclab.org/tag/calibrate-ndvi) so the NDVI results are in the proper range without subjectively selecting camera settings that force the results into the proper general range (which is what we are doing now).

There are lots of things to try.
