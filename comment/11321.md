I want to be able to:
1) capture spectra
2) have them calibrated to the capture calibration
3) find the other spectra I've named to make a comparison
4) make sets
5) compare spectra within those sets
6) save my comparisons scripts to share
7) embed my sets.
most of these features are a part of the current SW spec, but none have ever worked every time without a hitch.

I want a direct link to my spectra.  Currently they are cryptically under "dashboard" halfway down the page, under a second tab "my spectra"  I want to be able to find them immediately.

I want to be able to classify my spectra in a useful way beyond tagging (or perhaps tags can help me organize better).  I want to be able to make collections of spectra, i.e. all my oil tests.  Within those collections I want to be able to make. 

extra features would be including Dave's solar calibration features, increasing the resolution of camera capture, and having web controls for Gain, exposure, and white balance. 

I'm not particularly fond of the current "waterfall" capture system.  I would prefer if our capture interface was 2D, capturing the full spectrum, or preferably 3D, I.E. capturing every frame in a time series. That may be too data intensive, but could be used locally in the browser, and some limited set of data would selecting a capture line on that tiny little screen is rather difficult too.  It would be nice to have a bigger interface.
