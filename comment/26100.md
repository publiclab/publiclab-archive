Hi! focusing can be tough, but if you're occasionally getting things into focus you're doing well. The lens needs to be right up near the slide, almost touching. And a good easy sample is best to start with. Could you look at something very flat, like a bit of moist onion skin? Try dying it with a little bit of beet juice or food coloring to make it more visible! 

Sand is also good to look at. Try looking at some of these examples!
