The idea of using green for visible light isn't nearly as good as blue or red... but Chris is right, the green channel doesn't seem to leak as much NIR, so I thought a little more about it. 

Look at this image, from [the old near-infrared-camera page](http://publiclab.org/wiki/near-infrared-camera-history) (maybe we should resuscitate it, the graph is quite useful):

The green is certainly not as absorbed (the example is a graph of eucalyptus leaf absorption i found somewhere) but it is pretty close to red/blue, when you compare it to infrared. Granted, the sensor itself may be less sensitive to infrared -- so the graph we'd see of what the sensor *actually detects* may not be as differentiated. But green still seems to be quite correlated with photosynthetic absorption, and could still be quite useful. 

See the diff between R and G channels, above -- although it's rather "grungy" data since the dynamic range wasn't good, but with more rigorous testing, perhaps it is useful... what would be the next step, testing this technique against the Canon NDVIs?
