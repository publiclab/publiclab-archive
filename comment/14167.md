So what's your verdict? I see some differences in the curves. The laser pointer seems to shift the colour peaks a bit towards blue. Light and dark yellow lines swapped places. But what do we make of it? Do you think the expensive laser is better? Can you compare the curves to some kind of "official spectrum curve"?
