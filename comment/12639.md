Thanks for these comments everyone. 

[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) , i agree with your points, and appreciate your incredible work making better tools! i might add that it appears that there are multiple definitions of "better" floating around PL. I wrote this note to explore the idea that a more clearly documented process for contributing -- and debating what needs to be included in the next version -- might help these various definitions of "better" to more clearly surface. 

[@khufkens](/profile/khufkens) good to hear your points also. What you refer to in a phrase as "desired integration" is the phase that we are looking to clarify and open to broader public debate. Do you by chance have any good examples from other communities of practice that you could share?
