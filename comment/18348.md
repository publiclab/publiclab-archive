What might be the processing steps, to try to break this down? Could they look like some of the steps [@SimonPyle](/profile/SimonPyle), [@AmberWise](/profile/AmberWise), [@damarquis](/profile/damarquis) and [@amirberAgain](/profile/amirberAgain) have prototyped for dust detection? 

I collected up a bunch of this work under the tag [#particle-imaging](/tag/particle-imaging) too.
