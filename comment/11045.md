Ken, I'm very interested in the echem328 board.  I recently bought some Alphasense gas sensors and bought the ISB board to go along with it, but your echem328 board solves the issue of integrating the ISB with my custom Arduino loggers (http://envirodiy.org/next-generation-rugged-datalogger/).  Do you plan to sell your board anytime soon, and/or are you looking for collaborators for the beta testing of the hardware?
