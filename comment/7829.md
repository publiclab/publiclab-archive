Real long-exposure would be great; I think Camera FV-5 uses software based long exposure -- it just adds together a lot of half-second exposures, so if you are getting black (or noise) in each, they'll just sum to a lot of noise.

If it actually worked, it'd be extra useful for smartphone spectroscopy.
