[@bigmit37](/profile/bigmit37) I can't answer that for sure but I would recommend getting the one designed for outdoor use. I'm not sure if there are any differences in the enclosure but if you're going to use it outside, you want something that won't be easily affected by the elements. Also, there should be a version that uses an SD card for those who do not have wifi. But, of course, the caveat with that is that you will not be able to get real time updates on the PurpleAir map. You would have to get the data off of the SD card and graph the data yourself
