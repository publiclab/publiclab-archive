Has your community experienced any successes in attempts to protect or clean-up local water resources? If so, was this success achieved largely through community engagement, media attention, affiliative support from local colleges/universities, actively supportive politicians, industrial partnerships, foundation founding, state legislation/city ordinances, federal enforcement, judicial consent decrees, a combination of such factors or through other initiatives not listed herein?
