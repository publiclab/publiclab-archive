So there seem to be a few possible reasons that the intertidal infrablue photos are dull compared to other infrablue photos. One is that it was a cloudy day. Some of my cloudy day infrablues with Rosco 2007 are not much snappier than Will's intertidal shots. Another possibility is that the CMOS SD4000 has a different response than CCD cameras. But Will's intertidal shots do not have a blown out blue channel -- the red channel is brighter than the blue as it should be. 

Although Liz's Brooklyn tree shot is much snappier, the one in my research note (http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/05-31-2013/ir-treekit) was punched up a bit. But the original is quite a bit more colorful than many other infrablue photos, and it is not possible to punch up those others to look as nice as Liz's. Maybe it's just because that shot was partly toward the sun.   Is the Rosco filter on the inside in that A495?  Maybe that makes a difference. Is it a 2007 filter?
