[@warren](/profile/warren) The camera will be just part of the spectrometer. I am still considering whether to use LDRs (light depending resistors), as here http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Solar-Tracker/ or using Pysolar which calculates the Sun's predited position according to your coordinates http://pysolar.org/ . I personally like more the first one but both of them seem fine. Just tell me if you think one of them is better.
