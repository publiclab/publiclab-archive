Journal 1 Entry: One day, I found multiple water bottles laying on my lawn. They most likely came from us playing basketball a week earlier. They came from a pack of Kentwood out of cabinet. These bottles were made to perfectly shape and bottle water to carry around. It gives convenience. It's on the ground because of the carelessness of me and my friends. We were worried about drinking the water rather than the effects of littering. We were worried about the bottles before we drink the water, but not after.
