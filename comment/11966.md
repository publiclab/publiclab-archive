Ah, checksums are a brilliant way to handle that.

If memory serves, matches in ODM are image pairs, plus matches for pixel and line. Rotations and translations are only calculated once matches are back-traced in relative space to 3D camera positions, but image matches plus pixel/line matches could be used to calculate 2D transformations.
