 Building on the comment about lead (Pb), other metals such as Cadmium and Zinc are common alongside roads, and especially PAH's (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) that are made from the burning of fossil fuels (so car exhaust!) and deposited within 25m of roadways and bind in the soil. A good thing to consider is how the folks living near there would be exposed to contaminants as a result of the huge increase in traffic from the overpass. Are they growing gardens near there? Are children playing near there in the soil?
