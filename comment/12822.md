I would like to try that in a few days. I read a few articles on the topic. Agarose or Agar are mostly used, sometimes PVA. It seems easy to make your own KCl agarose-gel. But I wonder what will happen on the junction gel-ceramic pellet. I am afraid of getting a poor ionic contact with the sample. Maybe it is better to use pellet with a bigger pore diameter or even to just drill a little hole at the end of the tube.
