Hi Jeff - I think I might be able to help with this but I'm not sure what you are looking for. NDVI is simply an algorithm applied to two bands so you could create a test program that looks as a specific pixel in two bands and see if the output pixel has the correct value. The output NDVI value will be accurate as long as the input bands are calibrated. If the input bands are not calibrated you have to wing it (a subjective process not really related to the software package) and could test the output only if you have some reference features in the image with known reflectance. I have a feeling I'm missing the gist of your question.
