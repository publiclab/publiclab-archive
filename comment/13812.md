After two successful deployments of our temperature chains I can confirm that my heat-shrink and epoxy sensor mounting method goes the distance under water. The only failures we've seen so far have been wire breaks inside the cabling due to excessive flexing when we stuff them in the bags during deployment/retrieval dives.

But the more interesting news is that I think I finally have a handle on calibrating cheap DS18B20 sensors to the point where they will at least give HOBO class sensor networks a run for their money:

[DS18B20 Calibration: We finally nailed it!](https://edwardmallon.wordpress.com/2016/03/05/ds18b20-calibration-we-finally-nailed-it/) 

Adapt the size of the holes in the dry well and the method should work for other temperature sensors.
