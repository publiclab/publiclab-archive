Ok.  The last time I did this test was quite a few years ago. So there is probably something better, now.  The quick test was called "oil and grease".  You need to look up the details.  But the sample was liquid/liquid extracted with another solvent ( originally trichlorotrifluoroethane and then switched to crappy gasoline) and then run through a filter. The solvent was evaporated in a tared flask and the weight calculated.  The current versions show a lot of variations, but you get the idea.The amount of oil and grease could be roughly calculated from this test.  The problem is- how could you get a hold of any way to do the test?  Maybe the only option would be to pull samples to pull later? But that sounds potentially expensive.  Better tests are things like gcms or gc.  Maybe the frog gc seen earlier?  Any ideas?
