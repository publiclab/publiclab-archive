By the tube, I assume you mean the manometer.  The most accurate way to accomplish this would be to make a scale that is calibrated to your setup and then use that to measure the indicated water depth.  This could consist of a paper scale glued to a ruler or a similar configuration.  The reason you would want to use a separate scale is that the manometer reading is the distance between surfaces.  If evaporation of water in the column occurs then a fixed scale would not be able to accurately measure this distance.  
Of course, the more expensive and easier route would be to use a cheap single board computer with a differential pressure sensor to provide the data.
