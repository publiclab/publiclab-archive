Hi Chris,

I think I didn't answer your questions fully. With some tweaking of the script, yes you can grab the upload_image.sh and get_weather.sh scripts to start logging data.

The upload_image.sh script needs to be edited. You have to set a proper site name, and you might want to check the orientation of the image before you upload. I'll put some more hours in development to make everything easier to deal with.

As I mentioned in my post, the software is rough around the edges and is currently what needs the most attention, mainly making the install as easy as possible (if not make it so that you can do it remotely). I'm aiming for similar functionality as described in my [PhenoCam installation tool](https://bitbucket.org/khufkens/phenocam-installation-tool). This little script takes care of setting up the camera on commercial (expensive) StarDot cameras. Unlike the pi it relies on telnet, which is easier to script I feel.

Also, the window blinds as well as moving are kind of an issue. I hope people would be able to put it up somewhere on a lost (not often used) window (think attic windows or as you mentioned garage windows).
