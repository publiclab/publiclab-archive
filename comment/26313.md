[@guolivar](/profile/guolivar)   Sorry about the timezone trouble. But no worries! All OpenHours are recorded. You can find them on this page: https://publiclab.org/wiki/openhour-archive  Normally takes us just a day or two to get it posted. 

Also, if there are things you'd want shared on the call you can post them here ahead of time and I'll make sure they are brought up.
