Love seeing this project! I've been participating in cleanups along Bayou St John since I was a little girl, but I never realized that the bayou was connected to the lake! I learned a lot here: https://scienceforourcoast.org/pc-programs/coastal/coastal-projects/bayou-st-john-urban-marsh/

What kinds of surveys will your team do to determine the types of trash present and, once you do, how will you investigate the source of the trash? The bayou has become a major outdoor recreation place so I'm wondering if people spending time outdoors along they bayou are also dumping trash. I can't even remember if there are trashcans anywhere along the bayou for people to put their trash in.
