Dear JSummers

I have studied how to perform Arduino project as potenciostado , and frankly, was already
giving up because there are many difficulties to realize until I located public lab that gave me
new hope about the project. It is part of my work in college my teacher
asked if he could develop to resolve internal funding problems but the work will be also a
evaluation.
The work was divided into two phases : one to the measures using the Arduino and other systems use
scada , which already have more knowledge, to collect information and show graphically for monitoring
and control.
I wonder if it would be possible to have access to the project to try to implant in college. I noticed the plate
assembly did not understand how to perform the components could not read right , anyway. what can help me I will be very
Grateful

Sincerely,

Ivan Morales
