I am thinking of getting a modified DSLR for NDVI imaging and am having trouble deciding between two different options
- camera with Schott BG3 filter replacing the stock IR filter
- camera with filter removed and using lens filters

The second option seems much more flexible as it would be easy to change filters and 
adjust the spectral range, 
however, I am sure there is some good optics reason why a lens filter may
be inferior to a sensor filter, maybe to do with focusing?
