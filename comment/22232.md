 I wish that I had answers for you, unfortunately I am only a hobbist mycologist...  However I am absolutely SO STOKED about this concept and going to do some personal research to try and help you with your question!  

Myself and [@DanielleS](/profile/DanielleS) are both mushroom enthusiasts and were discussing at the last barnraising about starting a fungi book club, starting with this book:  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34427203-healing-mushrooms.  Let me know if you'd like to join in!
