Hi! Nice to digitally meet you.

I asked Nick about that when I did my build because I had the same thought. The only downside he mentioned was that there could potentially be activated carbon blowing out if the pump is not reversed. Presumably if pulling air through the diffuser, then hose and through the now-outlet of the pump w/ a tiny fibrous filter the potential for carbon spewing may be reduced. I don't know if that is true, but reversing the pump was easy so I went with it.

I'm not really sure what size particle would be of concern or whether the fiber filter has any effect on it? What kind of microdust does activated carbon give off & how much of a concern is it? That might be worth its own question.

The other thing I saw in one of the papers was that the vacuum pulled (drawing air down through the plant) may have been leftover from another design where the air was then pushed _up_ an exit column and subjected to a UV light in an attempt to kill any mold spores present. With positive pressure inside that would be impossible because the air just would go everywhere.
