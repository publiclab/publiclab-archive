Update: The u-blox NEO-7M board can be powered with either 3.3 or 5 volts. The GPS module itself is not tolerant of more than 3.6 v, but the board has a voltage regulator so input to the board can be 3.3v or 5v. All of the eBay sellers that include specs say that the board is 3.3v, but that must be a mistaken repetition of information about the module. I found a few other sellers that clearly state that the board is either 3.3v or 5v. 

That explains why the board was happy with 5 volts. It has been operating well on 3.3v, except for the programming issue. [I just did an endurance test](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-17-2017/skypod-endurance-test) while running the board at 3.3v. Time to do some rewiring and repeat that test at 5v.
