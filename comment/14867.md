[@warren](/profile/warren) has a good point; the smaller the change in transmitted light (as a function of attenuation caused by concentration change) the greater the potential for error contributed by the stability of the camera. So, yes, ideally any AGC or auto-exposure should be turned off so the only residual error becomes noise. Recall that the default PLab device only provides 8-bit data and that the measurable dynamic range is, therefore, less than that.

The steady-state measurement limits could be tested by comparing pre-prepared exact concentrations where the attenuation for each remains constant over time. Time-relative measurement limit testing would be more difficult (increasingly as the (dA/dT) [attenuation change per unit of time] increases). For several-second intervals, it might suffice to observe the 'step-function' of changing the concentration by adding a known quantity of the 'sample' or the 'solvent' to the sample under test -- assuming the mixing is quick [and, ideally, taking spectral data at regular intervals during that procedure.]
