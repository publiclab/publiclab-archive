If too much time passes from when i begin a draft note to when i can return to it, finding that draft can be near impossible. One idea is to display a list of your drafted notes on your profile page. Heard from [@mimiss](/profile/mimiss) that before the recent update to profile pages, there was a place to see your draft content; without that, [@mimiss](/profile/mimiss) keeps their own text file of URLs in order to be able to find their own draft content again later.
