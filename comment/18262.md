[@warren](/profile/warren), I thought the sandpaper we used (that was like a polisher) worked well to remove grime on the surface of the copper, which is its purpose. That said, I'm not sure if other sandpaper would work better or not -- I have no basis for comparison. This did seem to get the job done though. For usability, this sandpaper seemed like any other, where the surface gets used up after a while, but it's not like you need a brand new piece each time -- just use a fresh section of the piece.
