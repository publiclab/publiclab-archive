Hi Liz, thanks so much for compiling this, it's very interesting to look at it next to the 2019 report: https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/04-15-2019/report-2019-software-contributors-survey

I appreciate the different display types (esp the move away from pie charts). 

One small but important thing is that I noticed it seems you are not counting multiracial/multi-ethnic as identifying as people of color, perhaps if they also identify as white, although it's not clear exactly how you're parsing that:

> Greater than 76% of Public Lab's Code Community Survey respondents identify as people of color, including Asian, Indian, Hispanic or Latino, and Black, African, or African American. 22% of respondents identify as white or, multi-ethnic and white.

I do want to point out that many people who consider themselves multiracial/multi-ethnic and also check a box for "white" may identify as people of color (like myself), so I'm curious to know if that may be better shared as a distinct group or as part of POC; and in general perhaps it would be better to specifically ask if respondents identify as POC. 

Thanks!
