I've done a lot of lead testing.  This was mostly by atomic absorption (AA), in an industrial situation.  

The specs have changed.  The lead levels are much lower than they used to be. A lot of the testing is now done by ICP.  But, I have some experience with water testing, sample testing, incoming raw material testing ( the most common was clay), etc.

It can get nasty, with hydroflouric acid digestions.  For water work, you usually don't have to deal with HF.  But if you are dealing with lead in silicates, you do.
