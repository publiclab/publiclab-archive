The Public Lab spectrometers rely on cameras to make images of diffraction patterns. So the raw data is a photograph or video frame. Processing the image is done online (Spectral Workbench) or on a PC. An Arduino can control a camera and instruct it to take a photo or save a frame of video. The image would typically be saved to an SD card or sent to a browser or PC. 

So the processing and analysis of the spectral image is not done by the spectrometer, and could probably not be done by an Arduino. But an Arduino and TTL camera could replace the camera in a Public Lab spectrometer.
