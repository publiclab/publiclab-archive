Hi ddoob. If you follow the link on DigiKey (http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/TSL1406R/TSL1406-R-ND/3095064) to the data sheet, on page 17 there is a wiring diagram. For the spectrometer you will want to wire it according to the "Serial" schematic. Once the CCD is wired correctly, on page 13 of the data sheet there is a timing diagram. It may seem overwhelming at first, but its not too bad. The basic idea is you apply a clock pulse to one of the CCD's pins (CLK pin). To another pin (SI pin) you apply a pulse to start a acquiring new data as well as start reading the previous data on each pixel (AO pin), and to another pin you apply a pulse to stop the reading (SO pin). Does this help any?
