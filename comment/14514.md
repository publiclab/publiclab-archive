Interesting. I actually did kind of an "educated guess" calibration but I couldn't find more but one blue peak. I know that in the "usual" CFL there are three. Sometimes one of the three is not visible which leaves two. But in this case we have only one. That's kind of confusing... Perhaps one blue peak is diffused/blurred?
