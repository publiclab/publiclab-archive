Good point on the potential for software to warp the x-axis.

"Repeating the capture several times and trying to plot the results together could well only increase confusion because of the SW variation in calibrating the X axis." You're right. It could absolutely increase the confusion. That's called discovering how much error is caused by unmeasured factors, such as physical distortion or Mapknitter x-axis mapping. If the results are too confusing to comprehend, then we cannot scientifically say there is any measurable difference between the two causes (dye and no dye). That is scientifically relevant, and an important component of experimental design and analysis.
