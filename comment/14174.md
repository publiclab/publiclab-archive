I used new firmware, which had the ability to do low power mode on any interval over 5mins.

I use 6 min interval, to be safe, and it allows camera to power all the way down between shots. I don't know how to do this with a faster interval, though.

I had the lastest firmware from https://www.mobius-actioncam.com/downloads-info/
20151924 I believe.

Then the code on syscnfg will look different, and it's pretty self explanatory from there. Look at my [note](https://publiclab.org/notes/tonyc/03-22-2016/using-mobius-camera-as-a-trap-cam-in-field-deployments) for more info. I'd have to unhook the camera to get the actual code, and it's taking time lapse of a building being demoed.

The commends in the config file make it really clear, though. Not sure how long battery would last at 2 min. interval with camera remaining powered on, though. Probably not too long....
