sorry for the long absence, where should i load some photos and orthomosaics taken with the kite?
This model of kite works very well for orthophotography with out any rig and the camera is well protected in the frame, as soon as i have some time and make another kite i can make a tutorial about how to make this particular kite.
Recently I bought a drone and made some flights to try to see if we can spot a Roman Road in NDVI in some areas where is lost, and we have been able to find clearly in 7 out of 10 places, and in another  one may be yes. I am now writing the report, and with time I would like to make a an article, but I can also put a small note in here if you are interested in archaeological prospection, even if it has been done with one of those infernal machines
