really intersting.
i dont no how to make a lut but i'd love to have one. My idea is to mirror the values in the NDVIBlu2red.lut from NDVI 0 to 1 and values <0 rest as they are now. so areas of high photosynthesis should be green and low photosynthesis is red. is something like that possible? In my opinion it is more intuitive that healthy areas are green and not red..
