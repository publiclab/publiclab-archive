Setting a custom white balance on the Mobius camera can be done numerically. Determining which numbers to use requires trial and error and subjective judgements (my method) or some form of calibration (linking to a known standard). If the goal is true calibration (as Ned Horning has done) then no white balance setting is required and it is best to use RAW image files. Raw image files ignore white balance information.

Measuring the spectral response of a camera requires some specialized equipment (e.g., integrating sphere, spectrometer, calibrated light sources).
