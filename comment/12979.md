As you move to longer wavelengths, contamination by sunlight becomes less of a problem underwater because longer wavelengths can't pass through much water. But the absorption of those wavelengths also interferes with your measurements when you use them to determine scattering (a proxy for turbidity). So your NIR source (LED) has to be brighter or your sensor has to be more sensitive. Any NIR wavelength will probably provide good scattering results, so it might be easier to use a cheap NIR source and sensor and deploy the whole thing under a black bucket or sleeve. 

Also, filtering the sensor requires a filter. Wratten 87 is cheap, but passes all NIR including the near visible NIR (750nm) which is not absorbed so strongly by water. Cheap filters with a cutoff at 850nm or so are harder to find. And cheap filters don't pass 100% of the desired wavelengths so you lose some sensitivity and need a stronger source LED.
