Thanks Jeff! ðŸ˜ƒ  It might be interesting as well to trace back to indigenous data sovereignty values, concepts, practices co-developed in the 80s and written in the 90s in the PPGIS community. 
Community data sovereignty values, concepts, practices have also been present in decentralized internet movements, such as DiscoTech "discovering technology" https://detroitcommunitytech.org/ movement in Detroit, and RISE NYC since the early to mid twenty-teens https://www.newamerica.org/resilient-communities/flexible-future-ready-networks/rise-nyc/ (and the work that preceded that program) in which there were discussions about using the network for decentralized data collection and storage towards community data sovereignty.
