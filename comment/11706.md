How about just a partial 'fade-out' of the graphics plot range below 400nm and above 650nm (darkened / subdued colors) and then activate a text note in the UL of the plot area like 'Gain Cal Range'. The data, above and below, is still visible but it's obvious that data is, at least, less important (...less accurate, totally uncalibrated).
