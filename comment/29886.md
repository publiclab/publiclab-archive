Microplastic - Tiny bits of plastic of 5mm or less 

Once testing on numerous people, 17 of them were found with microplastics in their blood. Some have 3 different types of plastics. 

The amount of plastic on our planet is hastily increasing & will likely be doubled by the year 2040. 

After measuring 1.6 micrograms of plastic for every meter of blood, results showed over 7 concentrated micrograms.
