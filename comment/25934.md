[@danieisnietgek](/profile/danieisnietgek), I'm not sure if you can edit the title, but if have a suggestion which is that you add something about the raspberry pi.  

For example: Spectral Workbench Runs Slow On Raspberry Pi

Given that there is also the spectral workbench website, you might attract more people familiar with the raspberry pi version.

Just a thought.

Sorry I can't be more helpful in actually answering your question!
