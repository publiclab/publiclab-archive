sure, you can do it.  Of course the diffraction angle will be different. It looks like the  dvd has 1300 lines per mm and the grating has 1000 so the dvd will have a little larger angles.  I am pretty sure you can get a better price buying these in bulk rather than having students buy them individually.  If you are interested, I have a bunch of stainless optical slits and I could get you a few pretty cheap.
I am interested in your project.  What are you thinking of having the students do?
