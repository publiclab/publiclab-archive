[@david_uwi](/profile/david_uwi) That's fine, some of our tools require more technical understanding; the [wheestat](http://publiclab.myshopify.com/products/wheestat-potentiostat) also requires programming as well as soldering (to my understanding) but if it works, it works. Hopefully over time we as a community can simplify the build, or at the very least learn from it by knowing how its made!

Thank you so much for both posting this and joining our conversation!
