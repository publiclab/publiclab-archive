Tony, I looked at the note in email before I saw the comments from Chris. I like the innovative thinking. The drop test is cool

I'd second the point on using 4 legs, or camera enclosure, for the reasons Chris noted. I recall some years back Brooks Leffler of http://www.brooxes.com/newsite/HOME.html, commented on our protective measures for cameras, something like "... just learn to fly so don't crash..." Some of the KAP crowd fly cameras with little or no protection.

As alternative to the wooden legs, if wanted to surround camera with protection, looks like a juice bottle enclosure (opened up at the top) could be added to the basic idea with a hole or slot to accommodate the tripod socket screw.
