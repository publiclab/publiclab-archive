Hi Warren,

Thank you for your email; I see this is a greenfield area. I'd like to get this implementation to run as fast as possible. If you could point me to the relevant bits of the JS code for just the basic frame-level processing, I can start working on C code for this. My plan is to first get it to work witin an RGB frame-buffer, and then look at how we can use this as the output stage of the YUV decoder output. Goal here would be process 30fps at some resolution (subject to the CPU and memory subsystem loading); if needed we can dip down into assembler after we do the basic C model. Presumably there is some write-up on the transforms, so maybe I should just start there and do an implementation based on that.
