Hey Scott - is this a useful resource and would it be helpful (re Harvey) to build it out more with more specific instructions or guidance? And/or, would it be helpful if we did a similar call for other types of resources? 

I also want to get started on an image sorting workflow -- [@bsugar](/profile/bsugar) has expressed interest as well.
