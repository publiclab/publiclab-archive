The most common items we found in the Mississippi River were bottle caps, bottles, and plastic bags. These materials will take years to disintegrate. Scientists have determined more specifically that plastics can take 200 to 500 years to completely disintegrate because these materials do not naturally decompose. The pollution of the Mississippi river should be of great concern to those in surrounding communities. The river is a primary source of water and the plastic pollution can break down into small particles called microplastics that can enter our bodies. This can happen through the consumption of water and through the consumption of aquatic species that reside in the Mississippi River. In the long run we need to be concerned about our health regarding pollutants in our water.
