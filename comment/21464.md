Hi [@bronwen](/profile/bronwen). Thanks for the info. I'm not currently working with any of the microscopes, but am interested in the 3D side of things. Would you be able to point me to where to find adapter next-steps, or where to get updates when they're posted? I've been looking through the community microscope wiki and am getting a feel for navigating through the topics.
