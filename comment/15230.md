Hi, Jitesh -- I want to thank you for your thorough and well considered work this summer. The i18n project is so large that it could have seemed daunting -- as it touches a huge number of files and involves serious low-level reconfiguration, and even touches every single page on the website; a high risk if things go wrong. Yet your work was methodical, consistent, reliable, and steady -- exactly what's called for in this project. You've been easy to work with and responsive to suggestions and input. 

An all-around big thanks for your excellent work! I look forward to seeing it bring Public Lab to many new languages.
