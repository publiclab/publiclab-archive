Just found this on my sunday net random navigation.

[**Laser PM2.5 Air Quality Sensor For Arduino**](https://thepihut.com/products/gravity-laser-pm2-5-air-quality-sensor-for-arduino).  Â£50GBP

At the core there's this sensor [**SKU:SEN0177**](https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/PM2.5_laser_dust_sensor_SKU:SEN0177)
