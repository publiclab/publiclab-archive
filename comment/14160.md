Hi,

I used the posted images to create NDVI map but I have some exceptions as in figure:

[![errors.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/464/large/errors.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/464/original/errors.jpg)

this is the content of the log file:

Registering 2016_0306_151932_028.JPG and 2016_0306_151932_028.JPG using Landmark correspondences

It seem the process is stopping on 25% of the elaboration (you can see it on the picture in the figure)..can you help me to understand what is the problem?
Thanks!!
