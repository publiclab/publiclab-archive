Jeff,
CameraControl works, but its a little buggy.  The good news is that turning off auto exposure works perfectly.

But... turning white balance off crashes the app, and gain control is iffy-- Once I changed the gain I couldn't get it back to normal again, but the highest and lowest settings were available, until it crashed.

My hunch is that the demo app is just not up to date (it was made in 2009) but that the settings are otherwise available for adjustment.

##Custom Focus##
I'll check with the factory if they'll set a custom focus.  that would be perfect, no futzing with the camera-- no filter, no focus change, just put it in the box!

##Changing the Camera Angle##
It seems like the ~60 degree angle being discussed on the list works fine for this camera (I can't tell the difference) and it fits in the box better at that angle.
