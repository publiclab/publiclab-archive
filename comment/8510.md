Agreed, there is more than enough work here for two highly motivated contributors.

On your HDR example above, two observations: I think there is some conceptual error behind the plots. Notice the relative magnitude between the peaks in the top plot. Then, notice that ratio has actually decreased in the 'hdr' plot and that the magnitude of those same peaks relative to the (now amplified) noise is similar. HDR should not produce a lower SNR. If the 'grass' (noise) comes up, then, relatively, so should the magnitude of the higher SNR peaks.

You referenced setting "known exposure" levels though I'd not been aware the PLab webcam provided an interface to set the exposure. That would be helpful if it could, especially with good resolution. Presently, it is my understanding that the webcam has automatic exposure but that exposure is always operating at max sensitivity because the total light from just the spectral band in an otherwise black background is insufficient to cause a gain change. This is also why the background noise is high. With a lot of these PLab webcam spectrometer kits out there, there is a need to handle the images they produce. (See http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/notes/stoft/03-09-2014/hdr2-using-over-exposure-to-your-advantage for an example.)

So, yes, I'd agree that several improvements are needed: 1) compensate for curved spectral bands, then, 2) HDR from full-image data to recover a higher SNR signal from clipped data and, then, 3) auto-cal from a CFL capture.
