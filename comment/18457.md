For [@stevie](/profile/stevie) [@partsandcrafts](/profile/partsandcrafts) Which parts listed in the spreadsheet Jeff linked are essential to a prototyping kit? 16GB SD card - would a smaller size work? Immersion oil necessary? Which lens kit to start with, 40x lens or 100x lens? Phone light holder, USB light: non-essential?
