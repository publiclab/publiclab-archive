[@warren](/profile/warren) i just have one doubt in reply-by-tweet concept. If this is going to be used for replying to comments then how will the user will do tweet in reference to particular comment? We have to give some reference in the tweet so that the comment is identified and rest of the things can be handled by cron jobs using whenever gem.
