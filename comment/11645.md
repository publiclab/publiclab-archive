This is a wonderful overview-I'm going to have to read it more than once to grasp all of this.
I wonder  if you could explain more for me as a non-scientist about this.
Specifically, I'm wondering about light scattering and how that works with 2.5 u silica particles, as the small silica dust is the most dangerous.
When I've looked at bigger silica particles under magnification, they are so rounded, have so much sphericity (API 0.7 or better), that I keep wondering whether they'll scatter light as other dust does.

I know most chemicals have signature scattering pattern, and I'm sure dust detector makers have taken this into account
So 2 questions, as I look out my glass window-is there any difficulties with the wavelengths that silica scatters, and do micron sized "crystal balls" have any optical properties that an irregularly surfaced particle doesn't?
Thanks for any clarification you can offer.

And I have a raspberry pi that I haven't yet put to use; should some builder want one, I'll donate it

p.s- I have some chunks of snowy white Jordan sandstone that I could mail if it would help any device refinements. It's from a roadside, and crumbles easily. Also, I have a ziploc bag of what used to be a piece of Wonewoc sandstone that crumbled to dust-it has more impurities, as it's orange. Plenty of tiny silica.
