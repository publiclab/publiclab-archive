[@emmyallyn](/profile/emmyallyn) -- that's a great question which I think we will want to dig deeper into as we make progress on analyzing microscopic photos of dust (see [#particle-imaging](/tag/particle-imaging) for some recent work on this). Would you mind re-posting that as a question using the prompt below your comment? I don't know nearly as much as you do about illumination and polarized light, so we'd deeply appreciate the help.
