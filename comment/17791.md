This looks amazing. You can embed an activities grid on your post using `[activities:raspberry-pi-microscope]` or whatever tag name you want to use! Then there'll be a button to post activities. 

I'm especially interested in the one on setting up the Raspberry Pi as a WiFi camera -- it has additional applications on the [Raspberry Pi Spectrometer](https://publiclab.org/wiki/raspberry-pi-spectrometer) and [Raspberry Pi Timelapse](https://publiclab.org/wiki/pi-camera) and [Raspberry Pi Infragram](https://publiclab.org/wiki/raspberry-pi-spectrometer) projects!

Awesome!
