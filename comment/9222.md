Hi, nickha - very interesting! Sorry for the slow reply --

Can you upload an image so we can see your setup? 

I can imagine scanning a few different e-liquids and perhaps common ingredients and dyes, then comparing. What are you using as a light source?

Very much so! We are really in need of some code being ported into macros, so it can be run within Spectral Workbench. There are also a variety of issues listed which we're only very slowly making progress through. Anywhere you can help would be deeply appreciated!
