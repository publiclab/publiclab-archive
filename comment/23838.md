A few more thoughts...

On absolute 'average' intensity - You could use a Solux source (at fixed distance and known orientation) as a transfer standard. This would mean finding an attenuated solar measurement with close to the same measured level as a setup with a Solux lamp but then you would have a portable 'standard'.

On camera integration time: There are limits. If the source intensity is beyond some limit, the sensor will simply saturate no matter the exposure window. At lower intensities, there will be a trade-off with noise. Integration time is necessary to obtain sufficiently low measurement noise levels to not affect the collected data. SNR is really important with spectrometer measurements -- especially toward the IR where the sensitivity is dropping rapidly.
