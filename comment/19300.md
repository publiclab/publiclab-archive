[@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1) are you using one of the openflexure optics modules?  If so, that might explain why the 10x lens didn't work as expected.  Finite-conjugates objectives are designed to produce an image 150mm from the "shoulder" of the objective, with the sample a set distance (usually 35mm or 45mm) from the "shoulder", allowing you to easily swap objectives.  If your camera sensor is closer than that (and you're not using a correcting lens) then different objectives will focus at different heights - specifically, the 10x will focus much further away than the 40x because it has a longer focal length.  My apologies if that's obvious to you, just thought I'd mention it in case it helps debug what the issue was.
