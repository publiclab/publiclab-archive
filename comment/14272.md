First, the maths.  
8 foot diameter balloon weighs 600 grams, so when inflated each cm² weighs 0.00321 grams  
5.5 foot diameter balloon weighs 350 grams, so when inflated each cm² weighs 0.00397 grams  
(this ignores the nozzle part)

So the chloroprene in the big balloon gets stretched thinner (81% less material/cm²) than the little balloon which has 47% less surface area. So the material in the big balloon is a little thicker than in the little balloon, but not in proportion with the inflated size difference. But since you will only fill it to a diameter of about 6 or 7 feet, it will not be stretched as thin as a little balloon inflated to 5.5 feet diameter.  (The preceding information is not intended for application in the real world where you should consult with someone who has actual knowledge of the issue at hand.)

Does it take too long to get things shipped from the Netherlands? The KAPshop has good kite line deals. 600 feet of 90 pound line on a 6 inch winder for €10.10.  http://www.kapshop.com/p142/Winder-with-line-(40-kg)/product_info.html. 

Those don't look like the nice [Shanti hoop winders](http://shantikites.com/single-line-flying/shanti-hoops-yoyo-winders/), but I can't tell. Shanti hoop winders are the industry standard but are distributed only by Shanti kites, so they cost more than other winders. But other winders don't say "Unbreakable" on them. I'm pretty sure those are not Shanti winders because they don't cost enough. They must be the winders on this page: https://www.funwithwind.com/store/ListCategoriesAndProducts2.asp?idCategory=174&idparent=168.  The other less expensive winders are like these: https://goodwinds.com/line-winders/winder-reels/halo-reels.html. Any of these will work, but for serious and extended flying, most KAPers seem to like the Shanti hoop winders [like this](http://intothewind.com/Item--i-1260) or the ones near the bottom of this page: http://www.brooxes.com/newsite/BBKK/kitesales.html. The 500 feet of 110 pound line from store.publiclab.org is just what you need for this. They are Shanti winders, but they don't say what size winder that is. 

Flash photos of bumblebees 200 feet above ground? I'd say some explanation is required.
