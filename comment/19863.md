Dear [@JSummers](/profile/JSummers), thank for the reply. I assume you mean 3964 (instead of 4964) elements, and the 15 ms came from 4us (four times the clock ticks) x 3964 = 15.85 ms, the time needed to flush the ccd. I am probabaly misundestanding what you mean about integration time but in the code you states 4 ms for that, so which one is the time that the CCD is collecting ligth? 15 ms or 4 ms? 

Thanks in advance, I have been trying to figure out these parameters in the datasheet, but perhaps I am stuck in a misunderstanding and Toshiba does not help.

I attach an small sketh I wrote to drive the CCD with Timers in PWM Mode, but for shorter Tint, in case someone find it useful. Thank you and [@esbenrossel](/profile/esbenrossel) for sharing your work
