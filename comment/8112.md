on the installation instructions it says...
"In addition to the photo monitoring plugin you will also need to download  the metadata-extractor-2.6.2.jar and xmpcore.jar files."
i follow those steps, but today there are new versions...

Where are you going to get that screen ?
How long ago did you made the installation ? ( im on windows7 64)
