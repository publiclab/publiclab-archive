That last comment surprised me. Turns out there are three versions of the board at the github site; The one I was looking at has four holes on 0.2" centers.  The one you were looking at has five holes on 0.1" centers.  The third has seven holes on 0.1" centers.  Do you know where there is a picture of the board that you can buy?
