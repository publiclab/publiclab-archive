I also think that when a blue pixel is extremely overexposed, neighboring pixels may be triggered, either by current on the sensor chip itself or potentially somehow in the blending of color channels. So this is another reason to avoid overexposure, as it can cause a variety of color issues in addition to losing peak data.
