Hi [@Zengirl2](/profile/Zengirl2), 

I'm not sure about the copper strips. Whatever copper is used needs to be fairly pure, and I'm not sure if the copper tape is pure copper, or is a thin copper coating, or is compound. I'm also not sure if the adhesive or its decomposition vapors would become corrosive to the copper. I don't *think* the adhesive would be corrosive, but I really don't know. 

For weather considerations, I think the copper should be okay in the rain, but oxidation of copper may be enhanced by rain and humidity. That said, hydrogen sulfide dissolves in water, so if you were to protect the copper from getting wet, you may also be removing it from hydrogen sulfide that would have been airborne. I think it's worth trying in dry and wet conditions at the same locations, if possible.  If you attach the copper to cardboard (which could be great -- you made such beautiful prototypes), then of course you would want to protect the cardboard from the rain.
