Hi, I love the detail with which you've plotted (haha plots2) out the steps to instantiate a comment by email. I want to note that you and [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano) are proposing work that is adjacent and a little overlapping, which is fine! https://publiclab.org/notes/gauravano/02-18-2018/gsoc-proposal-email-integration-project#c18697

Email is a big area -- if you are both accepted into the program, you could both work on different aspects of this, and it's one of our highest-priority projects, so a team of 2 would be great. 

Please look over the comments I left on [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano)'s post, and the two of you could potentially work together to break down different parts of the larger project -- one perhaps working on reply by email while the other works on digest subscriptions and "meeting in the middle". 

For both you and [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano), I think there's some additional planning that could be done on testing. Think about what make up the minimal amount of changes that can be confirmed with a test, and that's the ideal size of a single PR. If you can break a feature in two, and test one half and merge that first, even if it's not "put into use" in the code, but just exists, tested, in the back-end, that's great! Then that code can be merged, and the next PR can "make use of it" to bring it to life with a separately testable "chunk" of code. Does that make sense?

There are some good mailer-based tests in our test suite already -- both of you can link to those by way of example, and think about how a "reply by mail" feature might be tested? With a test mail to be parsed? With several? What could go wrong? There's a lot there! 

And best of all, well-written tests can be used as a reference for how a feature 'should be used' -- they are like documentation, with example code!
