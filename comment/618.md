I've been on a few calls with Erika and Mike of Surfrider Emerald Coast / Walton Beach, as part of the Gulf Future organizing effort.

Gulf Restoration Network has a stash of Barataria bay oiled sediment from marshes and sands of Louisiana.  Jonathan just got back from vacation in Florida, i'm sure he got some more tar there.
