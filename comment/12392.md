These are compelling results. 

Would you conclude that:
With these sensors, 

1.  You would have to stay in one place for about 10 seconds to get a reading there,
2. The accuracy of the temperature reading is +/- several degrees (if the water is not close to freezing), and
3. The precision of the temperature readings is unknown because the cooking thermometer has unknown precision.

*These are your results for your "room temperature" water (I think).*  

What is the temperature differential across the edge of a plume that you would hope to detect? Are these sensors good enough to detect that edge?
