Still have to do more work.  But the acetone extract seems like something that might be doable in a home lab type situation.  The acetone extract is where I'm going.  Nail polish remover is something like 70% acetone.  And no bad extraction conditions are required.  Magnesium carbonate is available in the over the counter section of most pharmacies.  The public lab spectrometer should be able to cover the narrow range needed (say 425 nm area) without much problem.  The question is the centrifuge.
