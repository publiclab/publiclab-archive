Hi Liz, Thanks a lot for your comment. The plants won't get sunlight and our lights wont emit IR light but that's something we could add. I'm just wondering how infragram's data could help us to optimize plant's growth? Can we use the data to regulate resources like water, light, nutrition solution, etc.? Any ideas, suggestions or pointing me to the right source would be highly appreciated.
