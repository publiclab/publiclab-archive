Microscopes and microscopy are a fascinating introduction to many fields of science, and there are very good standard, introductory microscopes available right now for $100 or less. I have taught microscopy to children as young as 5 and 6 years old - Kindergarten and 1st grade, and to older grammar school kids. You can get a quick idea how to do this from my article, "Teaching microscopy to young children" - at https://www.mccrone.com/mm/teaching-microscopy-young-children/ . They are also great for science fairs and community science events. I am available to help!
