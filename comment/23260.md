Just linking in [@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro)'s comment here:

> [@Odie91that](/profile/Odie91that)'s a great question and one that many people ask. I'm concerned that if we don't reverse the diaphragm we might risk suspending dust from the growth medium in the air (the pump has a small filter in it so sucked air would reduce that risk). But there are many reasons why you might want to let it stay as a pump: 1) it is safer to water (no risk of sucking water into the pump and ruining it if its pumping air out) and 2) you can pull more HCHO into the system if you have a pump on the ground while the plant is in the window as HCHO is heavier than air.

In this build, we didn't see an instruction to reverse the pump, so we worried about the hose going underwater and making bubbles. Is that a big problem? Like, is it a problem if it bubbles through the water before entering the root area? Someone said it could create carbonic acid, but doing this is pretty normal in a fishtank with plants, so... we weren't sure.

Of course this would make a difference if the pump were sucking from the hose:

This was a lot of fun to build.
