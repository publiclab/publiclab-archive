[@MadTinker](/profile/MadTinker), I just take a look of the Colorado River Watch training, it looks very interesting and I want to learn how Colorado people monitor the water. Do you think I can apply for the course? (or maybe I should email the organizer to ask since obviously I'm not going to join Colorado river watch in the future...)
