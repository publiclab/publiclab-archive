As far as I know Plantower hasn't disclosed that (to be fair, I don't think any of the low-cost manufacturers has done either).
From the field tests I've conducted, it seems like their algorithm is based on combustion particles which would make sense if their testing facility is in China and they just use outside air to calibrate their algorithms.
Also, I don't believe that the sensors are **calibrated** individually but rather, the algorithm was developed and then implemented in the microcontroller ... hence the inter-instrument variability that you see and part of the reason PurpleAir has 2 sensors in it
