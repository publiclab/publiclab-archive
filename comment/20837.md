Thank you so much Liz! We have a new research note on this coming out any day (text is all copy edited) its just a matter of uploading it now. The new version of the kit will be slightly different (with the mesh and not the plastic, outlined in this note) so the instructions may differ by a couple words but not much! I think going forward having a single open doc that we have for the instructions (and with outdated versions of the doc saved as different versions) would help prevent snags going forward. In terms of translation do translators then just post a copy of the open doc? I understand more about how an open doc would work for layout than how it would work for translations.
