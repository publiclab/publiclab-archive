Hi, Cindy - so, any of the ones where you just have a sharp spike around 405 nm just mean that there was not any fluorescence, or perhaps just none bright enough for the camera to detect. So they are just matching other spectra where there was no fluorescence, like the mineral oil, which we chose specifically because it does not fluoresce (a 'known negative result').

The one with the 'wobbles' around it is interesting. It looks a little bit like a Raman spectrum, but I really don't know much about that --

Maybe [@stoft](/profile/stoft) or [@flatCat](/profile/flatCat) or [@dusjagr](/profile/dusjagr), or someone else can tell us more about if this has anything to do with Raman Stokes or anti-Stokes lines ([image from here](http://epsc.wustl.edu/haskin-group/Raman/faqs.htm)):

All three reps of Cuvette 2 of residue had those lines? And can you share a photo of Cuvette 1 and 2 next to one another? What was the difference between the two?
