Oh a whim, I just searched for 'gelatin reagent' and got [this](http://www.thermoscientific.com/content/tfs/en/product/remel-12-5-gelatin-reagent.html):

"The Thermo Scientific™ Remel 12.5% Gelatin Reagent, Acidified Mercuric Chloride is for detection of gelatinase activity of microorganisms. - See more at: http://www.thermoscientific.com/content/tfs/en/product/remel-12-5-gelatin-reagent.html#sthash.1KgRYJy2.dpuf"

The idea behind gelatin capsules is that they dissolve in water + the gut, yeah?  Could we exploit some of these properties as an indication of the presence of a microorganism?  First thought was: put a colored dye in the capsule, put capsule in other non-colored liquid (one that doesn't dissolve gelatin? or not quickly?); then expose system to microorganism ... when the color of the entire container turns the color of the liquid, we've reached a threshold ... </dumb idea>
