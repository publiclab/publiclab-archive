  > For this project, you may begin to overlap with this other GSoC proposal a bit.

I've read the proposal and also did some digging, from what I understand the approach is to move the image distortion class to leaflet.js. Parts of my project relies on using image distortion, probably work with the initial code and make changes later on once Anish has completed his work (portable)?

  > I think the best way to approach this coordination may be to skip making separate "maps" for now

Do you mean "multiple image" feature? As I mentioned earlier my approach was to list all currently uploaded images off map allowing the user to select what to load on map. Would it affect the coordination if we allowed user to select one image to knit at a time from the list of uploaded ones?
Since you mentioned I am confused as to how Anish's project will make changes to editor, apart from porting is there any visual level mods that would be made?

  > So, the map would just show all images by that user, or (with a toggle to change this) all recent images by this 
user, or all images from all users for this region.

This would be awesome. Will reflect this in proposal.

  > the auto-placement will basically never be good enough to make some manual adjustment 

True. So any possible reason that user would require for toggling auto-placement? Probably the GPS data doesn't make sense. Thoughts? 

I'll be working on modelling the interface. Will have note the list of features that will be required on the interface.
