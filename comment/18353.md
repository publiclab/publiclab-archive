Great question! The best thing to do is to keep adding content to your pages following the [Method Template](https://publiclab.org/wiki/method-template-lite), which both of these projects are *already* doing. Both of these projects are getting close to production, and folks have been documenting progress (using the Q/A feature, replicating activities, etc) along the way. At this point, both the Microscope and H2S detecting teams will start working with the Kits team to plan for inclusion in the store. Since these tools are in the first cohort of Community Kits projects, we expect that we'll be fine-tuning this process along the way, and will be documenting it all as we move forward.
