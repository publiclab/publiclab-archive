Hi [@JaylaE](/profile/JaylaE) great question. 

Here are some resources that might help you:

This might be the best one, click "launch the map" and there's a tutorial. When you get to the map you can search a location, and use the key on the left hand side. Check out the ones in the reddish color:

You can also look for more specific data here:

This one can tell you about some water quality perimeters, but not specific chemicals: https://waterwatch.usgs.gov/wqwatch/
