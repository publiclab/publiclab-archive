just adding some notes from a "walkthrough" Liz did highlighting some issues which overlap with the ones [@siyuan](/profile/siyuan) outlined above:

```
question search autosuggest is a lot of info at once -- needs thinking through

Try typing "particulate matter"

is this box search or ask?

hit enter

tried to search but got a form to keep filling out question

went back to /questions

trying "filter by topic" input

no results for "particulate matter" (due to spaces -- tags can't have spaces, sidebar should constrain to options)

```
