Hi [@forcha](/profile/forcha) this is a great proposal, thank you so much. Some feedback:

> 5. Accept multiple video resolutions

For this, we have linked in the issue to the Temasys library, which helped us to implement more of the modern Webcam API features in the Spectral Workbench library: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/pull/172 & https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/issues/87

Could you look a bit at that implementation, which enabled things like cross-platform webcam access and resolutions, and I believe did not require manually writing out the resolution options as you've shown? I believe it was possible in that library to query the available resolutions the camera provides and to offer those. 

What's more, I believe there may be a need to change the pixel dimensions of the canvas element AND the canvas context, in order to preserve the image size once we've fetched a higher resolution image from the camera. Can you try linking to the areas of the code where such changes would need to be made, or outline the questions you'd have to make such plans? 

Finally, I suggest developing the full-screen version in a second index2.html file, or in a folder /v2/index.html, so that we can deploy it for testing even before it's fully ready to replace the original interface. That way you can roll out improvements incrementally and your first published version doesn't have to completely meet all the features of the previous interface. I hope that makes sense!

Thanks a lot, again, i appreciate your proposal's design work, attention to details, etc!
