[@warren](/profile/warren), I'm not sure I follow the linking details for grids etc., but more abstractly, a tree structure comes to mind. This note describes one complete upgrade with the fundamental change of mechanically linking slit, DVD and camera. If an upgrade did not do that for some reason, it would be a fundamentally different approach. Beyond this basic concept, each component might be considered a separate sub-upgrade -- i.e. a number of slit designs, alternate grating options, alternate camera variants, etc. There is also the upgrade variant of materials -- all 3 parts still mechanically linked, but switching materials (like my note on using only paper and tape). So, I'm just suggesting that it is more the concept of mechanically linking Slit/DVD/Cam that is the "root" as opposed to specific materials. Similarly, this would also apply to slit designs. Maybe this would be applicable to your thoughts about grids and organizing notes?
