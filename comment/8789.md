Mathew -- AIR HOGS!  Just watched the video -- WHUUUT!!  We've got to do this!  That's so much fun!  We could be sampling the entire room remotely!  (Where do you find these links?!)

Sekjal -- I watched your (awesome) video again, and at the end you point out that we don't know how much the temperature of the cold pack may have changed (warmed up) in the interim.  I guess one simple thing would be to test e.g. a cold window pane, the temperature of which we think won't be changing much ... 

... but it *also* occurred to me that we do have voltage divider circuitry on the board intended for measuring a thermistor voltage (originally intended for the [thermal fishing bob](http://publiclab.org/tag/thermal-fishing-bob) application.  We could add a $3 thermistor probe, like [this one], add the appropriate resistor (3 K, in the case of that linked-to thermistor).  That thermistor is 4 feet long and coated in teflon, and works well between -55 C and 125 C.  We could be measuring the 'contact' temperature of an object at the same time that we're measuring the 'remotely sensed' temperature ... maybe useful for calibrations like the one you're attempting here, and also for other fun projects .... e.g., checking the temperature difference between e.g. the inner core and outer surface of a bread pudding fresh out of the oven .... science!
