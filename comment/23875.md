 The particle size distribution (mass, volume or number) is very variable and even though "on average" it's fairly stable, the day-to-day variability is very large and quite unpredictable.

There are [hundreds of scientific publications](https://scholar.google.co.nz/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=particle+size+distribution+aerosol&btnG=) that deal with characterising the size distribution in different environments.
