everyday

it's very useful for almost any application, given that you can upload your own kml files. 

during COVID, as i don't have access to my GIS machine, it's essential. 

It also has emergency response spill imagery

the static URL function is great

the print function is lousy, though. 

this is my default planning screen

here's my default Taylor monitoring link

it even has the most useful bits of EJ Screen, since EJ Screen seems to have been designed to subvert use in regulatory process, i mostly just use our own homebrew EJ maps, or justice map.

Here's a report i made, referencing ERMA links::

Maybe ERMA is too functional for the public lab site.
