I know NDVI is designed for remote sensing applications so I am not sure if this is worthwhile? Also not sure if microscope slide and cover glass changes image spectral properties?

I believe the supplied version of the Raspberry Pi camera has itâ€™s own flat field correction and we need to provide an alternate correction when the Pi camera is used with a different (objective) lens.
