 Awesome! i'm really looking forward to this project ! love the collaboration with urban growers in the city -- a great combo! We had fun a few years ago here in NYC doing just a little bit of work like this https://publiclab.org/5bf and there's also some talk from partners in Shenzhen ([@shantler](/profile/shantler)) about documenting rooftop urban growing
