[@ngocthuyluu](/profile/ngocthuyluu) I recently came across this information about lettuce seed bioassays for toxicity in soil and water. Maybe a low-cost option to try out? [http://ei.cornell.edu/toxicology/bioassays/lettuce/index.html](http://ei.cornell.edu/toxicology/bioassays/lettuce/index.html)

The “Testing environmental samples” link has instructions for how to perform the bioassay on soil samples.

And there are some other ideas coming up in the comments section of this question too: [https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/02-05-2021/what-are-other-ways-to-assess-soil-contamination-besides-directly-measuring-contaminant-concentrations](https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/02-05-2021/what-are-other-ways-to-assess-soil-contamination-besides-directly-measuring-contaminant-concentrations)
