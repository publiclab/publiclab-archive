cfastie, don't worry, we've got this covered. We just need to apply to the Civil Aviation Authority, as you've identified. I'm just ensuring I've got the landowner's permission first, as that's a requirement of the CAA's application process (note: it's open access land). As the balloon will between 60 and 150m it seems (from what others have said) that the application process is quite easy. There are no airfields/airports near the site, etc either, so it should be fairly straight forward, however paragliders do use the peaks, so it is something to think about. In particular using sufficient streamers on the lines - which is something I'd not thought of in relation to the experiment -it's vital they're not in shot! Could be a problem :)

I'll let people on here know how the application process goes.

For reference, the form I need to complete can be found here:

Thanks though for raising this, especially if anyone else finds this thread in the future.
