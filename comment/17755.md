Great question re: whether powering the Feather on the 3V line really does work well ... I don't really know.

But: looking at a [schematic for one of the Feather boards](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/028/801/original/adafruit_products_M0SCHEM.png?1448656357), it looks to me as though one could provide 3 Volts or so ( the M0's processor, the [SAMD21](http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/arm/sam-d.aspx#samd21), seems to be alright with voltages between 2.7 and 3.6 V) and power the brain of the board nicely.  Then it would be a question of whether any other things that are connected to the "3.3V" line in the system would be unhappy.  It doesn't look to me like anything in the system would?  You might still want to keep the option open of powering it via VBUS (USB port) so that you could easily reprogram the board.  Also, the voltage reference for the analog i/o would then become whatever voltage you are supplying on the "3V" line, so you'd have to keep that in mind with any analog measurements.  (sensor that has direct analog output, you might have do something clever.)   In any case, I don't think you'd be making the M0 chip itself unhappy by supplying 3 volts on the "3V" line.  Doing this "directly" -- without using an LDO between the battery and the chip, which wastes a little power -- is one of the standard approaches in low power datalogger design, I think.  

If you get the chance, there's some [nice sleep code for the Feather M0](https://github.com/cavemoa/Feather-M0-Adalogger) that I've used before -- would be really great to know how low-current you can go .... or, I'll beat you to it, as soon as I can find a multimeter :)
