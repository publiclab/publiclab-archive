Hi I dont know all the anwers to your questions but, the last one I see you have trouble shooting your camera from the distance like all of us. I have been working on that and there are three ways.
1) you can easily make and gopro camera see NDVI. connects by Wi FI.

2) you can mount a WiFi equipped digital camera and shoot with your tablet. But in this case you hace to take out the IR filter from the camera you buy, and I am not sure how far the cooection works. I know that 10 meters works but you may need more. The go pro works like 200 meters. Note all the cameras have WiFi.

3)You can DIY a remote controler (from radio control cars or planes) and make it to control your camera, and shoot it.
