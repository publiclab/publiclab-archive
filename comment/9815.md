My second lens arrived today and I reluctantly performed the same procedure (with a slight difference) on it. I went out and bought a glass cutter to score the ir blocker so there wasn't nearly as much force required to break and remove it. It turns out I was over zealous in knocking the ir blocker out of the first lens and this resulted in the shattering of the second piece of glass located 3mm below the ir blocker. This piece of glass below the ir blocker is obviously integral to keeping all the lens elements in alignment.

So I have now tested the new lens in the camera and it is tack sharp no matter how much I tap it. Happy days! The old lens is on the left.

Thanks for your help on this and I hope it helps somebody else to not make the same mistake.
