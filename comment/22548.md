Hi, sorry, that's always frustrating -- there is an auto-save function in the rich editor which you can use to retrieve drafts -- it's under the `...` menu on the lower left of the screen. It works only on the same browser on the same computer as you were using to write (as in, we don't auto-save on the server side for privacy reasons).

Hope that helps!
