Hi, Cindy - can you link to your actual data on SWB? 

The average should be in the "ideal exposure range" but the important part for the 3 color channels is just that they don't hit the top of the graph and 'get smushed' -- that'd mean we're losing the data from the top of that peak. The three color channels are averaged to get the "main" line. The "ideal exposure range" is really for two reasons: to prevent clipping (smushing) and to encourage people to get enough brightness that the line is not as affected by random noise, which could happen with a very dim spectrum. A spectrum with greater than 10% or so should have good enough dynamic range to use, but 25% or more is ideal. 

In the second image from your last comment, for example, the blue peak is not in the ideal range, but it's also not flattening at the top, so it's OK, I believe.
