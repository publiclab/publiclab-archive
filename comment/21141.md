Thanks for making this, Stevie! These are great statements! I wonder about the process to getting to things like clearly defined goals. Is the next step maybe a protocol to provide some guidance? How does accountability work and what happens when issues arise? 

a resource that was brought up on the call last night was this tool kit https://www.ucsusa.org/center-science-and-democracy/connecting-scientists-and-communities/scientist-community-partnerships

and related to the * footnote about sometimes things need to not be public this https://ethicalos.org/ could be a resource in thinking about when to OS and when not to.
