Hi Chris -- yep, the webcam is underneath (can't see it in the static pic I posted) -- it's all sort of a Pi + battery pack + webcam sandwich -- the Pi is unbelievably thin (lighter than an Arduino Uno, I think) ... the configuration is probably a little easier to understand in the video (and I also posted a little exploded schematic above).  The webcam in the diagram is the same shape-ish as the one Craig used.

Jeff -- we really ought to post the code asap, yes!  After LEAFFEST, we're hoping to post a brief tutorial / code here on PLOTS ... I think caching video / images on the sd card should be pretty straightforward (...?  Craig?), as it's really all just Debian Linux, and I'm guessing that someone has already figured out a pretty slick way of storing video from a webcam in Linux.  Craig has been pointing out that with the R-Pi, you have all of a standard Linux distribution at your disposal ... we've been trying to wrap our minds around all the possibilities!
