From [Carla Green](/profile/thegreencommunitygarden): My most memorable moment with Public Lab was my trip to Cocodrie, LA.  It was my first Barnraising.  There is where I met some of the most innovative and fun minds.  I experienced technology in a whole new way.   I was able to learn how to kite map, design a poster and see a 3D printer in operation.  It was a very exciting experience and established relationships with research scientist on whole new level.
