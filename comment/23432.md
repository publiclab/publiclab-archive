 I've used ion chromatography(IC) to analyze for a number of ions, including nitrate and nitrite.  The new instruments dedicated to IC are much better, but it is possible to get good performance with an HPLC and UV detector.  If anyone wants to go that route.  
A different detector I've used for nitrate and nitrosamine detection used pyrolyzing the chemical, then reacting it with ozone.  It chemiluminesces in the blue.  That detector was expensive, but sensitive to ppb ranges.
