Ifyou want to measure the spectra of various light bulbs, you can visit this web page:

http://www.upb.edu/en/contenido/smartphone-spectrometer

You can construct a mini-spectrometer for a smartphone and the software is free, you can download from:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.upb.cinti.SpectraUPB

The 3D printable models of mini-spectrometer (STL files) are all ready to use, also you can see the following video for the calibration by wavelength (lambda).
