Vidun - that would be excellent, that's the idea to link up the two. I did some tests here: http://publiclab.org/notes/mercyorangi/08-10-2014/sky-cam-enhancement-user-guide-app-icon-added#c9867 and there was an issue with the GPS recording in the EXIF tags correctly. But I think Mercy will post a new version soon.
