Same camera.
Canon PowerShotSD4000 IS
f/2
1/1250s
Center Weighted Average Metering

The Brooklyn shot you mentioned was resized to 2000x1500 pixels. 

I remember cycling between autofocus & infinity, but not seeing an immediate difference.  I wonder if my exterior blue filter had too many abrasions, was possibly smudged, or a small amount of salt spray.Do all of the images come out dull when processing in to NDVI & NBG?
