We'd discussed using isopropyl alcohol at the Barnraising; I'd love to know if it can dissolve oil. Matt Pendergraft ([@Matt_P](/profile/Matt_P)) mentioned doing this, and said the alcohol could just be left out at room temperature for some hours to evaporate off and concentrate the sample. Worth trying!
