 Hi Edie, thanks for this comprehensive response! I have just a couple minor observations. 

* For the [#4](/n/4) point, the button says "Publish" which does not seem to convey that there is an in intermediate step to finish formatting, adding tags, etc.  

* the input box text has a combined description "Ask a question or write a research note" which will confuse all experienced users of the site as each of these was formerly a separate workflow starting with its own named button. I am not sure, but maybe we could phrase it as "Draft"or something?

On another topic, while we haven't been using the concept "Chapter" since 2016 and all the links on https://publiclab.org/region are outdated, here is a page listing content by Continent that is kind of cool: https://publiclab.org/locations. If it's of any use, here is my list of the key pages on PublicLab.org in case you were looking for anything: https://publiclab.org/wiki/sandbox-sitemap
