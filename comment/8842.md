So I'll try to answer some ?'s:
The Shinyei was around $15- we tried that first. The Syhitech is something like $3 in reasonable quantities. So it's vastly cheaper and nearly identical when you look at them side by side. I don't know where the last place we bought them, but it was a many-weeks delivery time, probably offshore. We don't have DIY plans for how to make a speck- it's a real mold right now, but we want to work out a DIY process that deals with voltage regulation and light-tightness (these are what kill most attempts at this sensor usage). We do have a library of Specks- we just built a total of 300 to lend out- so if you are interested in borrowing some to try it out, of course that's what we are about. 150 are already out and about. If you are interested you can start by reaching out to me and I'll introduce you to the outreach folks in CREATE. Scott at healthy Gulf, we should easily be able to get you a couple to try out and see if it detects what you need it to detect.
