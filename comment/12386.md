Ah, the Event 38 NGB filter. That filter gives really interesting results. I haven't really figured out how it works so well. It must be the steepness of the cutoffs on either side of the red gap. It apparently works well with either sunny or cloudy white balance presets. It would be interesting to compare the two. Not only does it produce nice looking CIR straight from the camera, it also makes good NDVI, both without custom white balance settings. Here is NDVI from one of your photos:

If you have Lightroom or Photoshop and Bridge, you can batch crop all your photos to cut off the tubing. But it looks like ICE can deal with it.

You probably had enough space there to walk the kite down. One of you could have held the winder and the other flip a carabiner or something on the line and walk toward the kite. Winding in can be a workout, but it looks like you have a fancy winder. Maybe it is not designed to actually do much winding.

The low-flying Cessna suggests that you probably should not have been flying a kite there. You were just a mile from the airport, and directly in line with the runway. If you are closer than five miles from an airport, you are supposed to submit a Notice to Airmen. It might not have been approved for that location. Or maybe your flight would have been limited to 200 feet or so.

It's great to hear about your flight.
