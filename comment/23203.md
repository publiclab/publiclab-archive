We recently worked with an educational LaMotte kit that had a colormetric DO test. It gives a range for DO, but isn't precise. The whole kit is about $38 and has enough for a few tests. I'm sure you could order the packets for DO online though if you wanted to use this style of monitoring.

I saw your other post on this question as well (https://publiclab.org/questions/belkinsa/07-18-2018/are-there-any-diy-equipment-that-measure-dissolved-oxygen-levels-in-water) did you try any of those?
