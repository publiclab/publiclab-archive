Great -- see how, above, it is prompting you (it should, anyways) to make a step-by-step activity? You can also post one here, it's the same thing: https://publiclab.org/wiki/mini-balloon-kit#Activities

That would be so great! We'd love to reach out to the Kickstarter backers to see if folks would like to try reproducing your design!
