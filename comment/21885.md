On this one, I've been mulling over it for some time. I'm wondering a bit about whether we really need a page which, while well designed, focuses on reaching out and inviting people to post. Something that may be more about the feeling it gives people, and the explicit invitation. It might be more step-by-step, and even illustrated, than just a tight visual design.  

I like the basic elements in the design here, and I think they're super clean and readable, so I'm not looking to change that aspect of it. I'm thinking about if we might adapt some ideas from some very welcoming guides to open source contribution, however. Like:

I also like how https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/ mixes testimonials with pictures of people, guidance, and calls to action:

OK, here's a stab at a page oriented around this idea of "really encouraging and guiding people to ask a question":

Here, we feature a few questions that are especially well phrased. We forefront the people (and profile pics) of who asked them and we show that they can get good answers. 

We also put the asking form right on the same page, instead of the awkward 2-step type your question, then it opens in a form. We also simplify the form itself dramatically and focus on asking for more context and detail later -- low initial barrier with good follow-up. 

The biggest issue with this page is that it pushes the big list of questions down the page. But I want to note that if we do a good job on the dashboard and the front page, people may largely be /asking/ questions on this page, but not necessarily using it as a primary means to find questions. 

Still, I think we could do better on the listings. Could we split the page into half for asking and half for listing existing questions? This may need some more thought if we're going to add this kind of 'welcoming' feature at the top. 

What do folks think of this?
