[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)  I think it's not that journalists all want to be environmental scientists but that the advent of cheap sensors and the ability (of some) to store and process information is growing at a rapid rate. Journalism - as providers of public information - is positioned to be able to tell important, public stories from these new instruments and data streams, but as the students are detailing, there are a number of challenges to being able to do so, one of which is definitely expertise. It's highly unlikely journalists will start to be trained like scientists all of a sudden but I think what we can hope for is that they learn about some of the critical issues surrounding experiment design and data collection, so that they see these methods as a viable way to collect evidence, to think creatively about how to gather evidence for a story and that they might be well-positioned in the future to carry out collaborations.
