[@icarito](/profile/icarito) i have stopped uploading the gifs as directed instead added the links from giphy to it.
i was doing the same at first but  instead of the gifs being loaded the area for the gif was blank that's why i tried uploading them manually. Now the links from giphy are getting loaded perfectly!
