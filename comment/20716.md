Hi [@liz](/profile/liz), Thanks for your compliments. Our testing utilizes a standard sample collection kit with 2 bottles [1st draw, flush, 2nd draw] that is then tested by a lab certified by the NYC DEP. I agree with you about adding more info to our website, including nitty gritty details about testing process as well as more big picture info for the uninitiated to understand the issue with lead in drinking water, how it got there, and what the health effects are. We _just_ finished the website, webforms, and backend infrastructure to get the whole thing live updating with data as it comes in. It's just a small group of us working nights and weekends since about this time last year, but we certainly have a host of improvements and goals for the future. Thanks for your helpful comments to improve transparency!
