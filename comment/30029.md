Hi [@Girija0707](/profile/Girija0707), thanks for preparing this. I like the way you took the time to understand the Infragram UI and offer suggestions to improve it. From the mockup you posted, I can see you didn't change anything from the sandbox section(the section with the buttons and image container). Do you think that no improvements can be made to improve the UI? I'm curious to know your thoughts about this.

Also, I'd like to know how you plan on implementing the cross-browser drag and drop feature. Do you have any libraries in mind? Code snippets and diagrams would be very helpful. Thanks for working on this!
