[@amirberAgain](/profile/amirberAgain) that sounds fair, actually I got a little carried away, I'll go through the algos you mentioned for calculating area. That means that general workflow is fine right?
I'll implement uptill connected component labelling and then go through the algos you mentioned, would that be alright?
