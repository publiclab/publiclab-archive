Koen, These NDVI images look really good.  There are multiple reasons that could explain why the trees in the distance have lower NDVI values with the blue-filtered single-camera setup. One very common artifact is caused by scattering of blue light by the atmosphere. Images of distant things look bluer (have higher values for blue) because more blue light coming from all directions gets scattered toward the camera. If you are using the blue channel to represent visible light in calculations of NDVI, higher blue values will compute to lower NDVI values. If you used the red channel to compute NDVI in the two-camera system, red values will not have been inflated by scattering, so that could explain the difference. This Raleigh scattering is one reason to use a red filter instead of blue in single camera systems.  Here's an old note about this: [http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/06-26-2013/infrablue-haze](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/06-26-2013/infrablue-haze)

The 721 nm filter should produce a good pure NIR photo. I'm not sure what the 400 to 700 nm filter will do for you. An unmodified camera gives you that range already. A narrow band red filter might produce a pure red image and better replicate legacy NDVI. But exposure time or aperture will have to compensate for reduced light reaching the sensor.

You might want to try the lut below in Fiji (copy the lut file into the Fiji luts directory). The features of this lut are explained here: [http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/08-26-2014/new-ndvi-colormap](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/08-26-2014/new-ndvi-colormap).  Feel free to include the jpg below if you post NDVI images made with that lut.
