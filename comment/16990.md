Saw some great suggestions -- i also added a "wind scale" table riffing on the Beaufort scale, with advice on what to fly in what conditions (types of kites, balloons) and how to estimate the wind speed from things like flags, treetops. But it could use a lot more work! 

Thanks for input [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) and [@xose](/profile/xose)!!
