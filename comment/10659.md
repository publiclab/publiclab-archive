The PhotosynQ team is going through a similar process trying to find (or mostly likely just design our own) a conductivity meter to use with our MultispeQ. We had tried an off the shelf probe, but were unhappy with the results. What kind of hardware are you using (maybe we have some overlapping issues)?
