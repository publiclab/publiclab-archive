Wow, I'm going to have to try this. I tested some markdown below to see if it could display your code. The editor won't let me preview this comment, so I will post it and see how it looks.

\#include Wire.h   
\#include EnableInterrupt.h   
\#include DS3231.h   
\#include LowPower.h   

DS3231 rtc; //initialize the Real Time Clock  

const int RTC_INT = 5; //This is the interrupt pin   
int interval_min = 1; //this is the interval which the RTC will wake the MCU (microcontroller)

  //This function is called by the interrupt when it is triggered by the RTC   
void pin5_interrupt()  
{   
disableInterrupt(RTC_INT); //first it Disables the interrupt so it doesn't get retriggered   
}  

  //Puts the MCU into power saving sleep mode and sets the wake time   
void enterSleep(int h, int m, int s)  
{   
  //we give it an argument for when we want it to wake up in Hour, Minute, Second   rtc.clearINTStatus(); //resets the alarm interrupt status on the RTC     
enableInterrupt(RTC_INT, pin5_interrupt, FALLING); //Sets the interrupt on Pin5   

rtc.enableInterrupts(h, m, s); //Sets the alarm on the RTC to the specified time   
delay(100); //wait for a moment for everything to complete   
LowPower.powerDown(SLEEP_FOREVER, ADC_OFF, BOD_OFF); //power down everything until the alarm fires   
}

void setup()  
{   
Serial.begin(9600);  
pinMode(RTC_INT, INPUT_PULLUP);   
Wire.begin();  
rtc.begin();   
rtc.adjust(DateTime((DATE), (TIME))); //this sets the RTC to the computer time. More documentation in other examples  
}

void loop()  
{  
DateTime now = rtc.now(); //get the current time  
if (now.second() == 0)  
{        
  //at the top of the minute....  
  //calculate the next alarm time  
int nextHour = now.hour();   
int nextMinute = now.minute() + interval_min;   
if (nextMinute >= 60)   
{  
nextMinute -= 60;  

  //this bit of code assumes an interval time of less than 60 min. There is a more elegant way of doing this, I'm sure.  

nextHour += 1;       
}  
Serial.print("The Current Time is: ");  
Serial.print(now.hour());  
Serial.print(":");  
Serial.print(now.minute());  
Serial.println();  
Serial.print("Sleeping until: ");  
Serial.print(nextHour);  
Serial.print(":");  
Serial.print(nextMinute);  
Serial.println();  
enterSleep(nextHour, nextMinute, 0); //enter Sleep until alarm fires  
}  
}
