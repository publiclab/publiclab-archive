There are two problems: JavaScript generating the image file (with `canvas.toDataURL()`), which maybe could be done in a web worker...

Next, ensuring that the browser doesn't try to open the image, but just downloads it. Some discussion of that here: http://greenethumb.com/article/1429/user-friendly-image-saving-from-the-canvas/
