Wow, is that a holding pond Right next to a stream at the 55second mark - again around 2:12? [@junior_walk1337](/profile/junior_walk1337)  and [@ekpeterman](/profile/ekpeterman) do these have to be a certain distance from a waterway? or any other regulations around them? 

Also check out the 4:45-5:30 mark looks pretty nasty!
