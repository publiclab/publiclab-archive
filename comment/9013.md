If you have Garmin GPS units, there might be a better way for students to georeference photos. If the Garmin units save track logs, with a waypoint every 10 seconds or so, these can later be matched with the time stamps in the photos (gotta set the camera clock). Lots of programs will do this and write the Lat. Lon. to the EXIF header of all the jpegs. Notes and samples can also be hand labeled with precise time stamps, and these can be matched with the Garmin track log. Some cheap, old, tiny, digital voice recorders attach time stamps to recordings and have USB ports for offloading the digital audio files as wav. 

So my standard field protocol for some data collection is to have the Garmin keeping a log, talk into the Olympus VN-6200PC, and when I stop recording, take a photo of the sample, site, or whatever. RoboGeo later writes Lat and Lon to the jpegs and attaches the audio recordings to the photos.

Of course the audio files are analog data and have to be transcribed, but that could probably be done with voice recognition software. 

A phone app could do all of this, but how many students have phones these days. Wait, what?
