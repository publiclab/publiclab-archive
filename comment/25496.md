 Hi Stevie,

  

 Thanks for the quick follow-up. I had two windows open: the PublicLab conversation and the folder with the files. I dragged the files onto the PublicLab site and got the message "uploading files" but nothing else happened.

  

 I've attached the files to this note, and would appreciate your posting them so we can get help.

  

 Best regards,

 Crispin

Hi Crispin - about getting these files up, sorry you're having trouble. Curious, are you dragging them into your email in reply or directly onto the Public Lab website? If you're on your email, you can try clicking the link to the website. You can also just email them to me and I can try to help!!
