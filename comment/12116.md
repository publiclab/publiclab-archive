Nice tests!  A few comments:

Good catch on the 3.3V/GND errors in the diagram.  Here's the updated image:

"The input code and the LED code need to be pasted into the larger fishing bob code fill in order to function."

I'm still not sure why this is the case for you.  If all files are in the same folder named "ThermalFishingLaura" in the Sketchbooks Arduino folder, then by opening up the main sketch (ThermalFishingLaura) the other three should open and they should all talk to one another.  I'm using Arduino 1.0.5 on Linux, though I don't expect this would change by version or operating system.  I greatly prefer to organize my code this way, otherwise the files can become too long and chaotic for me to manage.

You could try epoxy or silicone for waterproofing and sealing the thermistors in the bottle cap, though that can be a fairly permanent state of affairs.  Hot glue can be a somewhat more temporary option, though that might melt things.
