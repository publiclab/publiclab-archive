Been using swivels for more than 45 years, and I find those displayed on the posting to be more difficult than most others to use.  I almost always use something like "Swivel with Interlock Snap" for ease of use and security when closed.  A Sailor for 20+ years proved most any line will twist under strain and relief.  The larger the swivel the more easily it operates.
