Hi [@stevie](/profile/stevie) we are currently testing out the new home page for Cartoscope where all current and future projects will be available and will make a post about it once it is ready. 

We had an interesting discussion about Cartoscope as well as the GRN's work after Harvey during Barnraising 2017 about things to look into for improving the platform and we are currently working to implement some of these. We are focusing on getting the NOAA imagery analyzed through Cartoscope and will be posting more about this soon.
