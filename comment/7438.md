Ned, this is good evidence that some materials, like grass clippings and pine boards, will be more easily distinguished from live green plants in NDVI images using the red channel instead of the blue channel to represent visible light. Cardboard will also be easier to distinguish. Other examples are tree leaves that have [turned red or orange in the fall](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/10-11-2013/oaktober), and [green vs ripe tomatoes](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/10-10-2013/lycopene). There is an unstated assumption that this pattern is widespread and that using the red channel for NDVI will usually allow better discrimination between live plants and other things. Is this your conclusion or do we have to test lots of other materials that commonly show up in the NDVI images we take? Aerial images might include dry and wet soil, various rock types, wet and dry sand, and various roofing materials (wood shingles, tiles, composition shingles, painted and rusted metal, tar, slate).  Is a red filter always going to give better NDVI results with the surfaces common in aerial or other photos? How often will a blue filter give similar or better results?
