Thanks all. I'm going to try a parafoil 5, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LZBEK4?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00. This is less expensive than the Into the Wind version. 


Also, I read the reviews on the Prism Stowaway Delta Kite and ordered it: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044TGS1I?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00

Stows to 18" package. Reviewers on http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/kap/discuss/ indicate tails are needed except in high winds.
