    Here is a list of the things you want to say:

    - The list MUST start after a blank line (like the preceding one)
    + Each line starts with a dash or asterisk or plus
    * You MUST put a space after the symbol before your text starts

    Numbered:
    
    4. If you want a numbered list,
    2. use numbers,
    8. but each MUST be followed by a period and a space
    100. The actual numbers are replaced with ordered numbers from 1

    If you like arbitrary rules, you'll love markdown.

This is how the preceding markdown will be displayed:
