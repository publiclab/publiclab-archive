Hello, [@nedhorning](/profile/nedhorning), I had recently been researching about NDVI and came across your amazing calibration plugin. It works great; however I have a few question for you, if you don't mind answering them.

I am doing a research on corals in a fish tank right now and I came across with these problems

1. Does the reflection of the glasses effect the result of the photo as you might noticed the light from the lamp is extremely bright compare to any other objects in the photo.
2. I tried calibrating with the CSV file you indicated in the article; however it seemed to have failed
    - White paper 0.866963, 0.900327
    - Black magnet 0.047486, 0.056651
3. Also, will water effect the image too?

As you can see, the light that is reflecting has the highest "NDVI" value and also the reflection from the mirror also shares exact NDVI value as the object.

Thank you very much and I am sorry if I asked some stupid question because I know very little about photo shooting.

And the reason why i flipped the min max value is because it just looks more obvious that way, so I am not sure what effect it causes to the image.

I used Rosco Roscolux [#2007](/n/2007) Storaro Blue Gel Filter
