By the way, thanks for mentioning the use of electrical tape.  Applying that suggestion took my attempt to build one from nearly worthless to vaguely useful.  I also suffer from focus and overexposure problems, but I was pretty happy with the result given that it's made from random things I just keep around the house.  Just wish I could find cameras that extend into the ~1100nm realm.
