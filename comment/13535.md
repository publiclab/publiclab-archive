[@Claytonb](/profile/Claytonb),
thanks for the test.
I assume the images are correct but the channels in the image captions are somehow mixed up. I guess it should be:

DB475/850
VIS: blue
IR: green or red

Event38
VIS: blue or green
IR: red

DB660/850
VIS: red
IR: blue or green

Best regards,
Thorsten
