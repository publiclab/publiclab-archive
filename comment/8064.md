RE: Visualight Brightness-  Interesting...  This could be a major asset to one of my other projects- http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/01-15-2014/will-infragram-help-with-indoor-hydroponics-aquaponics

Also, It does appear that the Visualight is based on an ATmega32u4, so if one were to make an updated version of the IR Eval board by replacing the ATmega328 with the 32u4 one could theoretically merge the schematic design into that of the Visualight build.
Is there a Github repo for the Visualight+Thermal Flashlight project? If not I was thinking of forking the Visualight repo and merging it with the Eagle Files, Schematics etc... from the Sparkfun page- https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10740

 For those in need of a translation the ATmega328 is basically an Arduino Uno, while the ATmega32u4 is used on newer boards like the Leonardo, Esplora, Micro, Yun etc...  The primary difference is the 328 communicates through a hardware serial connection.  This means that the module on its own can't actually communicate directly via USB, which is why I needed an FTDI Adapter to program the IR Evaluation Board directly. The Uno compensates for this by adding a second Atmega16U2-based microcontroller which is programmed to function as an on-board USB-serial converter.  The ATmega32u4 on the other hand creates a "virtual" serial port (aka "SoftwareSerial") allowing it to use the USB without a converter.  Not only does this make the overall cost significantly lower, but it allows for much more flexibility as you can define any inputs/outputs as serial connections.  It does have a trade off however in that it can make otherwise simple communications much more complicated.  I've found tinkerers hailing from an electrical engineering background tend to prefer the reliability of a hardware serial connection while programmers tend to favor the software serial because it gives them more flexibility if they know what they're doing.

  While I can claim no expertise in either field, I tend to avoid using software serial when I can help it...  We'll see if my caution is justified in the present case once I try the current flashlight sketch with the (32u4-based) Arduino Micro ...
