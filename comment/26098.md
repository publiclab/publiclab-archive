Hi jfalquet,  
I dont have experience with this but it looks like getting out to 13 microns is neither easy nor cheap.  Here are some options for a detector: https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=11777.
Here is an amplified detector that gets you out past 10 microns: https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=11689.
Good luck,
Jack
