[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)-  Have you or others done and/or documented any other work with historic aerial imagery?  This is a subject I've been very much interested in for years.  In fact my very first research note was for a project called the [DIY Time Machine](https://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/10-07-2013/diy-time-machine) which proposed using a DIYBookscanner to digitize historic imagery to supplement grassroots mapping data.  Also, somewhere I have a rough draft for a blog post covering the history of Kite Photography for panoramas etc...
  Anyway, I came across your post in the course of my current project wherein I'm trying to create a storymap to supplement a relative's experiences as a German refugee in WW2. Most of the material I've been trying to work with is in the form of wartime aerial reconnaissance imagery compiled by both sides.  However, since such images were often taken from converted Spitfires or Mosquittos, they typically require orthorectification before they can be layered against modern satellite data.  Warren and others will be happy to know that out of all available platforms, I've still found Mapknitter to be the best tool for this purpose. Has this been your experience as well?  Are there other tools that you are aware of?  Likewise, are you aware of any other current efforts within the PLOTS community that involves working with historical imagery?
