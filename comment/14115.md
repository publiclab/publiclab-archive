So I received 1000' of 150-pound Dacron this morning. Early this evening, I dragged my sons out to a nearby football field to try giving a kite 1000' of line. There was enough wind that the Hi Sky Delta was our choice. That went well and uneventfully.

When we got home, I realized that my Redstone-based camera rig only needed about half-an-hour of work to be useable. I finished with was enough time before dark to take it out for a test. So I was back at the park with a hastily filled backpack with some extra bits-and-bobs so that I could anchor the kite and attach the picavet. Not all of the right bits-and-bobs, as it would turn out, but enough that I was able to get the Dazzle Delta and the rig into the sky. With about 500 feet of line out, and only three minutes into the air, things became interesting.

At that point, the Dazzle Delta decided to point its nose back at the Earth. Down it went, with the camera rig on the line. Before it hit the ground, I decided to run backwards to try to keep everything on the football field, but it was out further than I thought. It went down in a nearby trailer park. I could see that the line was draped over power lines, trees, and a row of trailers.

Hastily, I rolled up what line I could, packed up my stuff and left the roll of line in the football field. I followed the line without having to trespass, found the rig was intact and sitting on someone's porch, and the kite was in a small tree right at the far edge of the trailer park. Another twenty feet and it would have been on a well trafficked roadway.

I knocked on a door and eventually got someone to answer. With fear of trespassing charges removed I was able to get to the kite. Detaching the kite from the line was quick and easy since I have recently adopted the Lark's Head knot. Packed up the kite and headed to the camera.

In my haste to launch, I had left the camera in "automatic" mode. So every ten seconds, it would take a picture with the flash. The camera was sitting on the property owner's front patio and the flashing had attracted their attention. They had just stepped outside, in their house-coats, when I walked up. I apologized profusely and they were ultimately relieved when the situation was explained.

I hopped a fence and went back to reel up my line. It only caught once, and was freed with a single tug.

So no equipment lost, property damaged, or charges laid (as of yet). I think I may have even made a friend.

Figure 1. This image was taken as the kite began to rapidly descend. The camera is headed for the patio at the top right.

Figure 2. Ten seconds later the camera is a whole lot closer to the ground and moving fast.

Figure 3. Another ten seconds and the camera has stopped, hanging about six feet off the ground. I found it sitting right next to the garbage can. Very exciting, but no contribution to science was made.
