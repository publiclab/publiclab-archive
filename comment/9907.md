Which cameras are you having focus problems with? The A2300 does not have manual focus, so the best you can do is probably infinity focus mode which is automatic focus that only searches for focus farther than about three meters away. Is the problem focus or blur from vibration?  
  
The Nex 3 has a CMOS sensor, so for a one camera NDVI system it will probably work better with a red filter (Wratten 25A) than a blue filter. Are you going to try to remove the IR block filter?
