Hi Cynthia, We got several GPS locations from patches of water chestnut, but I have not yet matched up the field descriptions with the GPS coordinates (I am not sure which field sheet goes with which coords). However, this is not very critical because we have lower altitude photos in which you can clearly distinguish water chestnut from everything else growing there. So we know exactly where it is in many of the photos. Ned is now focusing on the task of machine identification, and we can use the photos as confirmation. 

I am interested to hear whether you and Nate and Colleen think you harvested all of the water chestnut circled in the photo above [and in the other photos here.](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/08-02-2013/trapa-detection)
