Wow, this is a gorgeous piece of equipment. It seems to represent a huge effort in design and construction.  

I was pleased to learn that continuous rotation servos are now available for about the same price as standard servos. Pololu has a few for good prices: <https://www.pololu.com/category/143/continuous-rotation-servos>.

I hope the demand for peptide synthesis skyrockets and you corner the market.

Nice work,
