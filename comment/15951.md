Hi Warren, let me introduce myself. My name is jurist, im freshmen of physics engineering student in University of Gadjah Mada. Currently, im taking optic class. Which my lecturer asked me to build a pinhole camera. To increase the camera resolving power, i need to select the best wavelength, however, due to spectrometer's cost, my lecturer advised to build one. Then, i was introduced to this website. 



Things went good until i started to upload a picture, it wont calibrate and wont squeezed the image as usual. I am confused with most spectra which they have black background with a spectra lies in the middle which is easier to analyze by spectralworkbench. To be noted, whenever i edit a picture such as attempting to crop or tilt picture, it wont calibrate. how am i supposed to do?

Last, i would ask you what is the unit for the intensity in SB? Because it is only serve in percentage without any standard unit. Mostly, a percentage were meant to comparing two things like "object A is a half (50%) from object B"



I expect your fast respond due to the deadline of submission is getting closer
