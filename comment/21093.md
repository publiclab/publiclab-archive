Hi [@warren](/profile/warren),

> script to go back through posts and tag first-timer posts with first-time-poster tag, retroactively so they show up at https://publiclab.org/tag/first-time-poster, to improve stats on first-time posting

Sounds good to me. Also, along with that, I think all the new posts which are created by new contributors, they should automatically be tagged to keep the stats correct.

Thanks!
