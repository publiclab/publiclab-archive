Mainly just safety. just looking for something that would be a "positive lock" between the camera and the kite so nothing squirted out, or in case a rubber band broke. It's so easy to nick a rubber band with normal use, and even though I'd totally fly one myself, I'd be afraid of hearing back that something broke or failed on it.

Kind of dorking out on this, but here the thought is to put a stopper at the end of the dowel, so the camera, under tension from the sleeve, really can't fall out. With a bit of a filing job to let the zip tie end recess a tiny bit, it's really locked on there.

And here's just an added bonus of protection if you make the sleeve with a couple ties and use the ends to give you crash legs. Sure there's better way to use thicker ties, or longer ties and then tuck them in to each other to give little loops. But the idea is there.

Bonus on this is you can press the buttons through the sleeve, and you can see all the status lights through the clear plastic.
