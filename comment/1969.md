Hi Jeff

Check this link: <a href="http://www.bobtech.ro/tutoriale/raspberry-pi/78-streaming-webcam-in-format-m-jpg-cu-raspberry-pi">Raspi IP webcam</a>

It is in Romanian but you can use Google translate. You can add as many web cameras to Raspi as you whish, just use a powered usb hub. In 5 minutes I made my Raspi to stream live video.

I am using Opera browser on my Android phone to check-in what is happening in my house...
