 From a great suggestion from [@mimiss](/profile/mimiss) I dug up an EQ or equalizer visualization from p5js.org:

https://p5js.org/examples/sound-frequency-spectrum.html

It needs labels but otherwise it's awesome because with guitar tuning apps, it tries to guess the loudest sound, then finds the frequency of that. With an EQ, you can see where the Coqui sound is happening, along with the other ambient noise, then read its frequency from the scale bar!
