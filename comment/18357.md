Hi [programmer1200](/profile/programmer1200), that's an excellent question! I see you've got some content up about your project already, so the next thing you should do is start building a page using the [method template](https://publiclab.org/wiki/method-template-lite), where you can start gathering how-to's, posting activities, etc. If you're available this coming Monday, Feb 5th at 1pm you can also join us for [Open Hour](https://publiclab.org/wiki/openhour), where we'll be talking a little more about [Community Kits](https://publiclab.org/notes/bronwen/12-06-2017/develop-community-kits-with-public-lab) with some of the people who currently have projects in the pipeline. Looking forward to hearing more about your work!
