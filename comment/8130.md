The surface from motion (SFM) tools offer another approach to this application. Free ones like 123Catch (http://www.123dapp.com/catch), Hypr3D (now Cubify Capture)and others, or paid ones like PhotoScan standard edition ($179), or pay-by-the-drink cloud tools like Pix4D and Dronemapper, can generate a 3D model of the scene from your BAP/KAP images (some need geotagged images, some don't). Other tools like meshlab allow one to export and view, manipulate, scale and measure areas and volumes.
