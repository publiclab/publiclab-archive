Hi [@TommyJJ](/profile/TommyJJ) thanks for your comment. Just checked it out, looks neat. Always exciting to hear about new technologies. Some of the things that make this project important to me is that this tool is open source, it's easy to build and to understand how it works, it's really inexpensive or you can build it for free with the schematics that live on this site. Also, the spectrometer is created and supported by the Public Lab community.
