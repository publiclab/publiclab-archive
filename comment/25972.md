I think it’s great your working with a community gathering data. Ultimately, it’s up to the community to decide what they want to do w the data- I mean.. that’s what community science is all about. How can data affect change? How can you help the community meet their needs/answer their questions as a scientist? The community needs to develop the question they want  answered first.. do the research, collect the data., does the data support their question /hypothesis? Etc. take the data and present to elected officials and larger community. If data is very powerful- plan a press conference. What story does it tell ? What does the community hope to achieve from the outcomes of the data? When folks present data to community and elected officials , what’s the next step? Hope this helps ..
