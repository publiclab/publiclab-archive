[@ccpandhare](/profile/ccpandhare) thanks a lot, I'll structure it that way, plus i think we should drop the complete pwa for now, I can add elements like caching for offline use in the web demo itself along with other ui changes [@warren](/profile/warren) suggested. Apart from this I'll add https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues/190 at high priority and other improvements like modules and cli that i have already mentioned in the proposal, what do you say? 
PS dropping the pwa for now will give me a lot more breathing room and then I can focus on other stuff like modules and api very well.
