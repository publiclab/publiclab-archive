[@marlokeno](/profile/marlokeno) "2] In high humidity, is moisture adhering to a fine/ultra-fine particle?"

Good question! At TZOA, we have seen humidity increase the perceived size of a fine particle through an optical device in 100% humidity by as much as 500%. We don't see drastic effects from 0%-70% humidity. The U.S. EPA does education on these types of devices and are actively telling people to only purchase devices that include accurate humidity compensation. We've implemented one of the defacto compensation algorithms that translated into way better R^2 correlation to gold standard reference devices. Best, Kev.
