Sure, also for estimating emissions, see EPA AP-42 emission factors:

https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-factors-and-quantification/ap-42-compilation-air-emissions-factors

And lots of scientific papers about emission assessment archived from Emissions Inventory Conferences (yes, there's a conference!):
