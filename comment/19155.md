Hi [@warren](/profile/warren) !

So i found this JS library https://github.com/MatthewBarker/leaflet-wikipedia/blob/master/source/leaflet-wikipedia.js  
with **demo** here :  
http://matthewbarker.github.io/leaflet-wikipedia/

**This fetches from wikipedia API and shows markers on map ! Also it removes marker outside the current bounding-map .**

I will try to learn from this library and try to understand how the Leaflet's classes are getting extended here and how the Leaflet class functions are getting overwritten .

And the demo i made above got **43 downloads** in 4 days on **npm** !  Yay ! Thank you !!!
