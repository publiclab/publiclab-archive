We would *love* some input on selecting a better material for the spec v3 -- it's complex since not every black cardstock is actually black **in the near-infrared range**. Would you have any interest in testing out some different materials that we could still die-cut and print on? 

One additional suggestion has been to use a water-resistant paper or thin plastic. I'm wondering if we could make a water-resistant "sleeve" to slide the spectrometer into. Would it be enough to have a sleeve with open ends? Or would it have to have an end flap as well? Could we improve both water resistance and opacity at once?
