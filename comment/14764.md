Hi Nick, I think you could collect particles at altitude, since the wind hitting a free-flight balloon should be within the range that the Passive PM housing can manage. the samples need to be out for 7 days to get a deposition, and the equations expect an average pressure and temperature for that period.

I don't know anything about microbe collection though.
