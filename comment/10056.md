[@amysoyka](/profile/amysoyka), thats a very good suggestion right there! Will definitely incorporate the feature within the next 2 updates, much appreciated!

[@xvidun](/profile/xvidun), that would be great and I would like to hear feedback from your end as you test against your work, but as Warren mentioned the GPS tags in the EXIF seems off, so I am working on some formatting issue there, and will push a  new code with that update on the next iteration. 

[@warren](/profile/warren) thanks for pointing me to the wiki page! I have updated the infor to reflect on recent works done (the .apk and the user guide too)
