Just a note that I pasted in some more guidance on being a reviewer over here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/developers#Reviewers

Mentoring for [Summer of Code programs](/gsoc) has a lot in common with being a software "reviewer" with Public Lab throughout the year; to welcome and support our community of coders, we need to:

* always be kind and respectful! (remember our [Code of Conduct!](/conduct))
* help people to become better coders and don't make them feel bad
* encourage people to open a PR with their work even if it's not finished
* go through recent PRs to help people who are stuck
* use emojis!

Some specific things you can do:

* add links to relevant lines of code to help people see where to start, or for an example of a similar feature
* suggest writing a test to *protect your work* from future issues
* tag things as `break-me-up` if it's possible to do a project in separate simpler parts
