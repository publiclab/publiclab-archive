I work with dozens of community groups fighting PFAS drinking water contamination and I have a few things to share: 
(1) When testing, there are a lot of different tests for PFAS (The family of 3,000+ per and poly fluoroalkyl substances). You want to make sure you are using at least EPA's method 537. As you know if can be VERY expensive, so you want to make sure you use a good lab -- I would recommend looking at Vermont's list of consultants See: http://dec.vermont.gov/sites/dec/files/wmp/documents/consult.lst_.2015.pdf
(2) Oftentimes you can get a "wholesale" rate with a lab if you are going to do a bunch of tests for a consolidated price.
(3) Working with an academic partner means that they can often do the tests pro bono as part of a study and/or interpret the results for the community which can be helpful. However, it can take longer. See: Bennington College
(4) The DOD, the State, or the EPA should really be doing the testing. They have been lots of places. Where are you located? Organize your community to be sure that everyone can get the testing they need. 
(4) You are not alone! Learn more and join the National PFAS contamination Coalition at https://pfasproject.net/join/
