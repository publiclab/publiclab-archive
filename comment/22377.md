Hi! </br>
(5)You can try pointing your spectrometer to a white paper in the place of pointing it directly to the light.</br>
(6) I think that depends on the resolution of your camera. If you use a camera with an picture output of 3500x2000 for example, the spectra will always be smaller that if your camera output is, lets say 900x600. Anyway the size of the image is not important for spectrometry unless you want to print the image.</br>
Another thing you can do is what I do. Since spectralworkbench does not work on Iphone I capture my spectra using the regular camera (something you can do also offline) and then upload it to spectralworkbench. During this process you can crop the image.</br>
You can also try reducing light inside the spectrometer https://publiclab.org/notes/xose/11-22-2016/reduce-light-inside-foldable-pl-spectrometer
