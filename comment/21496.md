 [@Bronwen](/profile/Bronwen) that's a good question. I think I did check the USB camera it did work I think but I will have to check that when I am off work. 

And you can upload a picture in the Spectral Workbench but the picture will positioned wrongly and it is not possible to rotate the picture. So uploading pictures also is not a possibility. Which is what I also already tried on an android device, desktop computer and a windows 10 tablet.
