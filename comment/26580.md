Thanks!!! [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) for reviewing

1. Have added mockups for Custom Insert Modules-Wikis, Notes, Nodes, Activity, Question, Inline Maps. Any other issue where you fell that mockup would be helpful

2. For testing, I have basically given one week for integrating the jest-puppeteer and another week for adding two tests.I feel that setting up and writing test initially will be a little bit difficult at the start.After having the initial setup, it become an easier process. So we can then start involving the newcomer in it. We can make a list of the test that needs to be added. Similar to https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues/1369 .If time permits I will do some more test myself
