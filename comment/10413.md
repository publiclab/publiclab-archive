Good question. There are some luts in a separate directory on Github that I didn't grab. Once you install the plugins you'll see an added option 'Photo Monitoring' under Plugins, in Fiji. There are four options: 'Create dual image list',  'Dual image image processing', 'Single image index processing from directory',  Single image index processing from displayed image'. 

Put your NIR and RGB images in separate directories (don't ask me why, it just likes it that way) and run 'Create dual image list'. This writes a text file with paths to the two images. Next, run 'Dual image index processing', which asks you where the text file created in step 1 is. This loads the file and in that step you'll be presented with a screen that provides a dozen or so luts for processing, in a drop down. There's a bunch of other options in that screen so you'll need to look for it. 

I didn't need to download the luts from Github. This suggests (again) that I should probably figure out where the installer puts everything since I'd like to have them.
