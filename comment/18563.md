[@warren](/profile/warren), I get that, this really is a short time and would be great to talk about doing so at some other opportunity. I commented to [@ag8n](/profile/ag8n) 's post. I think it is important that we evaluate images captured by the HW setup used by the public lab set up to know how those particles look like threw it. 
It might be worthwhile to try to reach out to Edmund optics, at last month's Photonics West they were giving away business card sized polarizer freebies, maybe they will be willing to share some with the public lab.
