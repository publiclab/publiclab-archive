Hi, thank you so much for your feedback [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) !! 
I elaborated on my testing strategy in the omonim section - thanks for pointing that out! As far as external CSS libraries go, I have added the open source Paper CSS framework for simplified padding management. :) I also belive to be entirely possible to allow code reusability through instruction regrouping with easily-dentifiable names in CSS; this could be easily achieved by adding the [@import](/profile/import) at-rule statement followed by the name of this project's print optimized stylesheet to any possible future files (traditional high-abstraction class inheritance is not part of the CSS standard, it could be achieved by using the LESS tool but it's unfortuntely not widely supported; however, common attributes imported from external files trough the [@import](/profile/import) rule can instead be easily ovverriden by future contributors).
Thank you so much!! ðŸ˜ƒ
