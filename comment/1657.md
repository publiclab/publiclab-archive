This is amazing!

I am also interested in this for the classroom and I have been trying this out myself and had limited success getting enough light from the flame into my phone camera to get a nice response.  I think I will just have to find some webcams/laptops and try this setup instead. 

One question however...I noticed that the dvd-r had a purple tint to it instead of the normal colorless polycarbonate.  The dye is usually purple and I am wondering if you cleaned the DVD off before trying this (isopropanol/ethanol works well).  Regardless your lines were quite nice.
