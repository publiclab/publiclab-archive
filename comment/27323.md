Hi [@nearsys](/profile/nearsys) and [@zwettstein](/profile/zwettstein) ([@midmarsh](/profile/midmarsh) and [@usere6020](/profile/usere6020) too),
Thanks for your willingness to contribute to the open-weather global 'nowcast'. Here is a link to a form where you can submit your materials to the open-weather archive for purposes of co-producing the nowcast. As I mentioned earlier, all you need to do is record / decode a NOAA pass from your ground station location on Sunday September 6th, and submit the results through this form. All contributions will be fully credited. Please let me know in the event of any questions or issues!
