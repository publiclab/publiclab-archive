I posted a related question awaiting approval but may be more useful to follow up here. 

I am trying to estimate the error for PA2.5 values as provided by the PA-II service. 

A Maximum Consistency Error for PM2.5 concentration is the only information provided by the sensor manufacturer. I believe a measure of precision, not accuracy.  Laboratory testing^ revealed accuracy of one sensor isn’t impressive. Also precision, humidity and most probably aging are affecting uncertainty estimate. 

PA-II includes two laser sensors. An unknown algorithm estimates particulate concentration. I wouldn’t exclude further processing by PurpleAir, maybe matching against an accuracy estimate obtained correlating nearby certified sensors where available. This before finally making PM2.5 averages available on the map and through JSON API. 

All of this to say I have no idea about uncertainty and probability distribution of data I am currently reading through JSON channel.  Any news from [@guolivar](/profile/guolivar) and the reliability study cited in this interesting post?  Helping to shed a light on the issue. Thanks
