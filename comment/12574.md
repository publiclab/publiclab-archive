This is an old thread, and this has probably been resolved.  However, Matlab has tools which enable which support conversion of Matlab code to C code, for improved speed of execution.  This may help with implementation/generalization from Matlab (which costs thousands of dollars per license) to a subroutine under Spectral Workbench.
