Hi there,
I'm also wondering about where it would live. I think a lot of first time PL users don't see or go to the chat, so I'm wondering if a bot on the dashboard might be more helpful if that's possible. I have a few ideas:

- I'm wondering if a bot could be used to help first time people who come with a specific interest, and direct them there more quickly. For example, 
   - if someone comes with: "I just have a question".  The bot could help get them to the Q/A interface and help them write a good question. 
   - If someone wants to "share work" maybe the bot could help them find what subject they're interested in and direct them to: answering questions, updating a wiki, posting an activity on that topic.  

- I think a bot might also be useful in helping people learn about what's on the dashboard and help them sort what material they want to see (the tab where you can select questions, research notes, comments and events). 

- One other idea I'm thinking about is helping people who aren't coders post GitHub issues. I've started to see things that might be website/bug issues posted on the Q+A. A bot that could help people distinguish between the two and post accordingly might be really useful.

Also one question I have is how hard would it be to change what the bot does once it's made? My concern is, for example, if we have a bot that helps people navigate the dashboard, what happens if we change something on the dashboard? 

Thanks for your work on this. It sounds really neat!!
