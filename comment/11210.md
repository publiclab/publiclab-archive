That covers the first problem but not the second.

So I think you'd need to do one of two things to really preserve the historical contributors:

* Maintain a complete history of the repository by way of version control and build it into the standards and practices. This more or less guarantees all contributors are tracked, and it does not attempt to turn this tracking into something user friendly which is doomed to fail.

* Maintain a complete and full copy of every `contributors.json`, frozen at the time of forking, inside the current `contributors.json`. This will become very large and ugly, but it's moderately manageable with technology. If one person merged two projects with a common ancestor, then there'd be a lot of redundant information in the full copies of `contributors.json` of each project found inside that one person's `contributors.json`.
