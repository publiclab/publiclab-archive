Fixation is the conversion of nitrogen gas into a more usable form. 
Assimilation happens when plants take up nitrogen and absorb organic matter via their roots. 
Decomposition is when waste material from digestion, along with dying plants, animals, and fungi, return the nitrogen compounds in the organic matter to the soil. 
Ammonification is the process of microbes or other organisms in the soil breaking down organic matter into simpler compounds. 
Nitrification is the conversion of ammonia into nitrite; then to nitrate. 
The denitrification process returns nitrate back into gaseous nitrogen.
