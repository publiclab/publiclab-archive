Here are a couple ways to do this. One is to use two cameras mounted as close as possible to one another with the shutter release synchronized to both cameras operate at the same time. One camera would be unmodified to record blue and green bands and a second camera would need to be modified to record NIR. The second option is to use a filter wheel in front of the lens of a camera with the hot mirror removed. For each image you would need to take three photos, one with a blue filter, another with a green filter and a third with a NIR filter. This would only work well if objects are not moving in the scene. 

You could also look for a cyan colored filter such as: https://opticalfiltershop.com/shop/color-filter/color-filters-cyan-572nm/ for a single camera setup since that passes green and blue light but the filter I looked at would have a combination of red and NIR light recorded in the red detectors of the camera sensor.
