[@marlokeno](/profile/marlokeno) That's a great tip for eyeballing and catching dust.

On that note, as I clean up a prototype of some code to automate this process, I'm looking at [Flat Field Correction](http://imagej.net/Image_Intensity_Processing#Flat-field_correction) to correct images. If we can take a control image without a sample, we can divide it out in ImageJ. This will cut down on uneven illumination and lens dust.

It helps with vignetting too, but I think we still need to crop the region of interest inside any vignettes because the surface area measurement will go into our calculations. Even if we can make the vignettes drop out to the background tone, any particles they obscure won't show up in the captured image.
