With vertical imagery being a significant barrier to entry at times, it would be wonderful to see the Atlas serve to as a place for field notes around oblique imagery as well. 
If the imagery is not vertical enough to be used in mapping without heavy distortion there is still great information and utility with the data in oblique format.
