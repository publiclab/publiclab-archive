Your idea of having participants upload a solar spectrum sounds good.  One idea on this is to simply put a bit of the thread sealing teflon tape over the slit and point at the sun at local noon.  If one layer of tape does not attenuate enough to prevent detector saturation then add more layers.  The transmitted spectrum through teflon is likely to be the same as the reflected, as teflon is opaque by reason of light scattering and not absorption.
