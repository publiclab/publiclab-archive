Hi [@mathew](/profile/mathew), thanks for contribution!! 

I performed the test making yogurt in 43‚Å∞C
Was completed in two hours ... dont require much effort of the equipament, however I think to chenge de source (12V 5A) for de independent power supply to the peltier chip.

Arduino had a little overheating on the voltage regulator through the Arduino Vin.
