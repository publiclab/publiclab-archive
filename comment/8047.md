This is a pretty interesting investigation. You are breaking new ground in a few areas, so there will be much experimentation to do. For example, Infragrams taken through glass and water of aquariums plants under special lights will probably require custom processing and interpretation. Also, CMOS webcams vary a lot from one model to the next in the proportion of RGB and NIR that end up in each color channel ([some examples here](http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-08-2013/infragram-webcam-test-raw-images)), so comparing results to previous Infragram NDVI results will require special consideration. The Pi NoIR camera may eventually improve this situation if they ever implement the code to do a custom white balance before shooting photos. Webcams usually do not allow that, so you are at the mercy of the built-in auto white balance algorithm. In one of your photos below, the histogram shows that the blue and red (NIR) channels are almost equally bright for a small patch of plant leaf. If the blue and NIR values for a pixel are similar, computed NDVI will not be very high.

Although white balancing will improve these results, it might be that the blue channel is almost as bright as red (NIR) for leaves because the blue "pixels" are being contaminated with NIR. As you say, hardware problems like that are hard to fix. So reproducing the NDVI values of other devices might be hard, but there is still a lot of plant health information in those images because they record how much NIR is reflecting from leaves. There is a lot of experimentation required to figure out how to get the most plant health information from CMOS Infragram cameras. Classic NDVI might not be the best way to present the results, but we don't yet know what is.
