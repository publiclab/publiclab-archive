It seems like a big hassle to 1) regulate the airflow over 24 hours  2) confirm! that you have regulated the airflow.  This is most of what the MiniVol Does, assure you that the airflow is regulated.  collecting the sample is the easy part. Standardizing the sample so you know what it means in context, harder.

but, if you just want to do presence /absence--Like, the coal pile company is denying that coal is making a substantial contribution to PM (vs diesel, they always will say it's diesel or car exhaust), this  could be useful to get a sample, then have it tested by XRF to show %coal  (or other pollutant, like grain)
