Ah, i see -- i mixed up NaOH3 with NaOH from [your other post](/notes/dhaffnersr/04-09-2016/analysis-of-2-stroke-motor-oil-and-87-octane-gasoline-using-prolight-1w-uv-led), sorry! Maybe another reason to provide a brief explanation of what each is and what it's used for. 

I apologize, but just so I can follow exactly what you're doing, could you try answering the questions I had posted above? I'm still not clear on what roles NaOH, NaOH3, and fluorescein play in your research here, can you help me? Thanks!
