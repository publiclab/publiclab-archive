[@warren](/profile/warren), I didn't get a chance to run this activity yet, but I will because my next commit will be from the terminal.  In the meantime, can I suggest that the tutorial by [@liz](/profile/liz)  ["How to make the most basic github contribution"](https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/11-02-2016/make-the-most-basic-github-contribution) be elevated to the top of this activity with some text such as "If you'd prefer not to use the terminal, you can also learn how to make changes in the browser [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/11-02-2016/make-the-most-basic-github-contribution)."
