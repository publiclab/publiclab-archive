Thanks guys, sounds like more will be coming soon and we'll all welcome the results. 

Don, I think it would be very useful to have an an Arduino-based prototype that records GPS as well as R,G,B, NIR sensor data.

Re: why fly a gps? While it is different from the the artisanal, hand-crafted maps we make with Mapknitter or desktop tools like PhotoShop, there are at least two cloud-based for-fee services that take sets of geotagged images and produce georeferenced maps and digital elevation models, e.g., Dronemapper.com and Pix4d.com. For some users, willing to pay, this approach can enable them to quickly get map results of their flights.

Glad to hear you can get helium, essentially on demand. Hasn't been that way in the Bay area, but I haven't checked recently.
