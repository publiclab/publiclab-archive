 Hi [@briwilgre](/profile/briwilgre) Thanks for offering! I don't think we've got an urgent need for more of this particular part as such-- we've been working with a different setup (you can see how it all goes together at our most recent [Raspberry Pi Microscope Assembly activity](https://publiclab.org/notes/bronwen/11-29-2018/assembling-the-raspberry-pi-microscope))

That said, not everyone is building Raspberry Pi Microscopes with the same configuration as the kit we're currently selling-- I think there are lots of people who would be interested in seeing this particular adapter (and others) evolve: we'll probably be posting some images of a few new adapters we've been trying out.  Are you working with any of the DIY microscopes, or are you mostly interested in 3D printing? If you're mostly interested in the 3D side of things, I think we do still have some cool challenges to dive into in terms of adapter next-steps for this and other projects, which I think we'll start sharing out in research notes soon.
