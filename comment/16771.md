Hi, Ben - I hear via [@stevie](/profile/stevie) that you've switched to a higher power supply (2.5 amps) but again it only worked for ~24 hours. (https://data.sparkfun.com/streams/pwvJ7v7XDdim0MObQaEp)

Have you plugged in a laptop at the ethernet cable outside to confirm that it's still providing an internet connection? 

If you have a PageKite.net connection of some kind, I can try logging in remotely to see what's going on. I thought yours was up at http://opkchicago.pagekite.me -- but it doesn't look online to me. Do you have any info about that that you could share (though don't post passwords here, of course)

Another thing to try is to set up the Pi indoors at the original location to ensure that it's still working there. That way we have a better idea of exactly what's changed.
