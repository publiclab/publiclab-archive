Hmm, very interesting! I wonder if we can find one that's around the $50 price range and still has good resolution (i.e. >3 megapixel). The HD Hero is $150, but maybe used ones are cheaper.

Does it have spherical lens distortion? That could be corrected for but is also a consideration. 

Great idea - the conversion process is not hard, but for newcomers it can be daunting.
