Thanks for sharing [@Manasa2850](/profile/Manasa2850).

In the first part, you mention... _There is no option for users to subscribe for email notifications whenever there is a new post on topics they follow._
...there is a page(https://publiclab.org/subscriptions) that contains notifications settings and the user can choose to receive daily or weekly notifications on topics they follow.

Under the _Tag Locking_ section, you have an image of the maps, is that related to tag locking? I didn't get that from the explanation.


Thanks for sharing, and all the best!
