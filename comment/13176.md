Hi Jeff. I took triplicate spectra of each oil, before mixing it with water and after recovering the oil from frozen water. You can find them at my spectral workbench. 
Their title is in this format: myInninitals_OS_oilName_IN_... for initial sample (MV_OS_05W30_IN_...) or  myInninitals_OS_oilName_PO_... for recovered product sample (MV_OS_05W30_PO_...). 
I am about to take also triplicate spectra of the oil water mixture before freezing very soon. With Gretchen we decided that I won't be using mineral oil for my samples. 
- At the Barnraising's OTK session [@ethanbass](/profile/ethanbass) mentioned that certain dilution of Oil products mixed with mineral oil do shift the spectra. Specifically lower dilutions. [@ethanbass](/profile/ethanbass) is working right now on incremental dilution tests to identify the shift. I was thinking to do the same thing and compare, but I think we would probably need some at least semi-precise pipettes to do that. Otherwise if you are using drops or eyedropper you will end up with huge increments after couple of addition. I discussed that with Gretchen too. Will see maybe I'll ask my lab to donate me  some old pipettes if they don't need them anymore.
