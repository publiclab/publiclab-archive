Well I don't have a degree in chemistry, but I have training in it both in the Navy and a robotic's company I use to work for. My raman setup isn't finished yet but I believe I can really simplify the concept design since the principle is to excite the sample and magnify it so the detector can pick up the image without have to get all fancy and expensive with a high tech camera.

I have some filters that I use for my computer controlled telescope, so I am testing those for filtering the laser light from the detector.

Actually you could teach me a lot of technics for sample preps.
