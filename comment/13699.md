Hi, [@mokeymark](/profile/mokeymark) - I have a good theory as to the issue with your spectrum -- that the uploaded image is too big for our data storage system. I think we can get around this through not storing unnecessary precision (in https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/issues/335) but we're still finalizing that change, so please hang in there a few more days. 

In the meantime, you could help us to test this theory by saving a lower resolution (say, 1000px wide, max) version of your un-cropped spectrum image, and posting a link here. Thanks for your patience and for identifying this bug.
