It would be amazing if you could do this.  I tried to capture RAW data but could never figure out how to  de-mosaic, color balance and scale from 10 to 8 bits.  Makes you appreciate everything the picamera does to make images/video . 

One option to consider for post processing is image sequencer.  I donâ€™t think it accepts TIFF  but its open source format makes it adaptable to new tasks.  http://sequencer.publiclab.org/examples/#steps=

See below for an  image sequence that tries to scale plants to green/blue and objects to yellow/red.
