Some good notes on this over the years:

And the original post on slits here: https://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/09-25-2013/photo-printed-collimation-slit-for-the-backpack-spectrometer -- [@mathew](/profile/mathew) writes:

> In the balance between accurate spectra and light sensitivity, the .09mm slit seems to be the best. Its spectral peaks were just as pointy and clear as at .03mm but it produced brighter spectra, without the cutoff and internal reflections that began to be an issue at .12mm.
