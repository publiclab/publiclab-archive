Great notes.
I think you are OK to fly at low altitude, I would recommend calling the FAA flight service hotline and they can give you official clearance:

And as for the $$$helium I source helium nearby in the bay area and the cost has gone up around 60% since I purchased 6 months ago. My supplier seems to think that the price will come back to that level by the end of this year. I want to keep track of what others are seeing and hearing out there.
