Hi [@kelv](/profile/kelv)!

I'm working on the other design project (the welcome page). I use github pages to share my design demos - I think [@warren](/profile/warren) and the rest of the team appreciate it as they can scroll up and down the page and get the feel of how the entire page looks like.
