Amazing!

At [IMVEC](https://publiclab.org/profile/imvec) we're working in a couple of cameras using RPi zero and one of them involves internet connection to display obtained images online.

Both involve the use of the [Witty pi mini](http://www.uugear.com/product/wittypi-mini/) board to manage energy of the pi.

Using the combined image everything goes like a charm. The camera is accesible and the command line works perfectly. 

Trying to connect to internet using wifi I'm unable to turn off the acces point and turn on the wifi. 

I've set up wifi credentials using wpa_supplicat (wpa_phrase and so on..) and turn ap0 down using "ifconfig ap0 down". After this "ifconfig wlan0 up" but nothing happens... How can I do this?

Woul be great to have a little interface in the captive portal page to turn of acces point and connect to a wifi signal and download packages needed for the different recipes ;D.

I understand further connection should be done using terminal + keyboard + monitor...
