Hi Jessi - I uploaded a sketchup file on the bottom of this page: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/6-12-2012/mobile-android-version-spectral-workbench but since i haven't received it from Shapeways, i kind of want to save people the $14 until we at least have some basis for making improvements. That is, the next time someone orders from Shapeways we should make improvements based on the first Shapeways print, so as soon as it arrives i'll upload photos and notes and we can iterate. At that point we can edit the Sketchup model and move forward.

If we get lucky, it'll just work, and I can just press "offer for sale" on Shapeways.
