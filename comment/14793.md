[@stoft](/profile/stoft), Hey dave, I'm not upset or anything like that about beign asked critical questions, I suppose I should have labeled this study as "Possible esoteric qualities inherent on theoretical comparisions."

I'm joking, I know the "why," I am trying to figure out the "way." I have two spectrometers now, 1 with a high speed cmos camera and 1 with of course the JDEPC-OV04. I will be doing this again using spekwin32's prototype hardware control program which works fine with the JDEPC-OV04, I can subtract the dark counts and control the camera's parameters (albeit, the one's that can be accessed) this one I can access the gamma correction and exposure time, which should be very helpful, maybe not so much the gamma correction as the exposure time.

I will compare the fluorescein samples again using the two different spectrometers, that should be interesting, as far as the respect, I meant I would just like to be acknowledged to a degree for progressing to this point, than when I first started doing this.
