Wow, that is super cool! A few things i was excited to notice --

so extrusion printing seems not to yield precise "slits" so you cut it with a razor saw? that's very good to know. For the PVC one I used a band saw and it work surprisingly well.

I was wondering about the mounting angle and expect that people may want it to be parametric. I was thinking of making a spectrometer on a kind of swivel joint so that you could collapse it down when not using it, but this could also let you choose an ideal angle. I'll upload a sketch soon.

I love the idea of nubs with rubber bands. I was thinking of adding an elongated tab to keep the device rigid and stop it from wobbling which throws off the calibration. I'll include this in my sketch. 

I was also wondering if you'd be interested in reposting your Thingiverse post on the Public Lab site, mainly because then you'd show up in the "contributors" list on the spectrometer page, which seems proper and fair. 

Thanks Brad, awesome contribution, and as always thank you for respecting the license and releasing under the CERN OHL!
