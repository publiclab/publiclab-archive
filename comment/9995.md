I love this construction.  When I was a kid I got really into building rogallo wings out of balsa and paper or plastic and attaching glow plug engines to them.  Wish I had pictures!  

The wing structure was super easy to build-- draw some degrees of circle on a flat sheet, cut it out and glue to an A-frame.  It made a very light flier.  Best of all, the weight and balance made it quite stable, although I never got into adding avionics.
