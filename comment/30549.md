Biodiversity is important due to every species somewhat relying on one another as interdependent, not limited to them, but also us. Millions of species provide food for us, or things like clothing, such as hemp, and sheep. Though the removal of one or three species, depending on what they are, they can alter the ecosystem heavily. An example of biodiversity could be the introduction of the plant known as hemp, producing clothes for us to be able to wear.
