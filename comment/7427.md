Dear Ned et al.,

I am pretty new to all this and on my way to convert my camera for NDVI mapping. After reading this post I am little confused: blue or red?
Even though the NDVI values you present are highly correlated (r = 0.75) and thus should produce similar maps if calibrated/streched there is some non-linearity between the NDVI values of the blue and red filters (the pine board is either between dead grass and card board or between tar paper and dead grass).
Hence, I am wondering if a dual-camera NIR setup with a blue filter for one camera and red filter for the other as well as some fancy LUTs and/or equations would result in even better NDVI estimates?

Regards,
Thorsten
