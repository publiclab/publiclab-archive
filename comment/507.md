Too bad about the tiny ribbon, but USB via CHDK is probably a solution that the camera kit Kickstarter backers will deal with gracefully.  Because CHDK is written for specific firmware versions, two issues arise. Versions of CHDK are available for three firmware versions of the Powershot A495. I hope all the cameras you have ordered have one of those versions.  Also, it will make life much easier for the camera kit backers if both cameras they receive have the same firmware version. If not, the SD cards used in the cameras will not be interchangeable. The camera has to be jumped through some hoops to learn the firmware version. Fingers crossed!
