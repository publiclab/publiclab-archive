I attached the picture of the slit.  It's from the "standard" desktop spectrophotometer kit that was purchased from here.  Any tips with regard to getting it sharper would be greatly appreciated!  Also, is there any way to download the spectra (with actual data points) where it could be manipulated (ie, subtract spectra from one another, manipulate, etc using something like Excel)?  Thanks so much warren!
