Hi!
I've followed all the recommendations (except refocus) but the blue hump is still there: https://publiclab.org/notes/pablo/11-09-2016/how-to-do-upgrade-desktop-spectrometer-kit-2-0-to-the-version-3-0?_=1479464146#4.+Enhacements uhmm!

A year ago with the same DVD-webcam in the v2.0 spectrometer I got this spectrum: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/61001
No blue noise.

I'm going to try to put the camera back in spectrometer v2.0 to see what happens.
