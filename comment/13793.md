[@aldehyde](/profile/aldehyde) - It's just a python-made program that basically looks at a pixel of an image based on location (X pixel width, Y pixel height). As far as I'm aware each pixel possesses a distinct RGB 8-bit integer value ranging from 0-255, where the red and blue values are then used for the NDVI equation to output a NDVI value for that specific pixel. All data (X,Y coordinates/RGB/NDVI) is then outputted to a csv file for me to plot using a program such as Tableau.

I wasn't the one who wrote the source code so I'm not sure if I am allowed to share it. I can however ask around and see if I can't upload it somewhere and share with the community.

[@Claytonb](/profile/Claytonb) - I was actually looking at that from the  "related research notes" links after posting my research note. I have been wondering about the IR leaking into the visible channel so it is interesting that it is considered important enough to compensate. Will definitely design an experiment or to exploring this and will share my results on that afterwards.
