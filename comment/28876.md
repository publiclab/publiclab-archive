This is absolutely wonderful, [@seankmcginnis](/profile/seankmcginnis)! Thanks for responding to needs brought up on the Open Calls by creating this custom code and sharing it! 

I had a couple questions that I think will help me understand better how this works: 

+ Would you be able to please say a little more about what a hosted feature layer is? Is it needed to obtain the Purple Air data in the different file formats you listed?
+ You wrote the code in the programming language Python--are there applications that you'd suggest someone could use to run this code, after they've downloaded it from your github page?

Thanks again, this is really helpful!
