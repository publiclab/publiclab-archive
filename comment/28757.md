[@denissebn_06](/profile/denissebn_06) I think it would be useful to write a post about AQ monitors' cost and operation on the [VVAMP Page](https://publiclab.org/wiki/vvamp). We have a variety of monitors in storage and can write a review post. VVAMP had a prolonged R&D phase and I would like to share that process. Perhaps that would be helpful to others who are researching pm and are looking to deploy AQ units?
