Hey guys! I wanted to provide some feedback on our topic cards that have replaced the smaller tags on posts. I've been getting a lot of feed-back from first time users and have some proposals that I think can help to solve theses those users are having. 

First, students are having trouble adding tags because our tag editor box is short and they're not easily able to see the entirety of what they're typing.  A wider tag editor box on posts could help to alleviate this.
