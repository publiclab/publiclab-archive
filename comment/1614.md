Hey buzzy - we'll be posting some instructions soon, check out the early design diagrams here for the papercraft version: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/10-10-2012/first-draft-vector-files-foldable-mini-spectrometer

MFarmer, that's a really nice design! I think we could probably afford to do a 2-part mold. We should try doing a printable version soon and get someone with a RepRap or other 3d printer to try it out.
