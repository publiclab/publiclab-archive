Maybe we need "recent contributors for the current bounding box" so that would involve refreshing the map. Sorry I am on the run but maybe sagarpreet already suggested that?

> oh great! That is helpful! Do you remember what qualified someone as a "recent" contributor? Currently, I'm looking for contacts in the European Union for projects (old or new), and thought the map might be a good go-to, but only two people are showing up right now. I wonder if we could get one that shows people who have posted or commented on Public Lab? that way we wouldn't get all profiles, but those we know who have people who have engaged on Public Lab before. What do you think that map would look like?
