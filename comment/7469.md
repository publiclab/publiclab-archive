Adam, thanks for the tips! I'll try the electrical tape next time. Aside from the minor problems, we had a great couple of flights, both with some very nice images. On the second flight, we did a survey both at 100m and 200m of our urban prairie restoration, the day before a dozen horses arrived that we've employed as lawnmowers. They've eaten down a lot of the vegetation and hopefully are distributing seeds and pressing them into the soil for a nice regrowth in the Spring. When they leave in a few days, we'll do another survey and soon after that I'll be doing a full writeup and will share here.

Here is the survey site: http://goo.gl/maps/muPzD

And I'm adding to the note above a low-res image of the stitched survey images. 

Thanks,
Jason
