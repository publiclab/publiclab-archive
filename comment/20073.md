A couple of gottchas here.  I think you want to use the lego spectrometer with a light source.  The light source would be fed through a cuvette filled with the liquid for analysis, correct?  Final assumption- your measurements will be done in the visible.

If all of the above are true, then a tungsten halogen lamp is a good source.  Usually, coverage is pretty good from say 350 nm to 700 nm.  The intensity will vary, but if ratioed , it can be accounted for.

Good luck
