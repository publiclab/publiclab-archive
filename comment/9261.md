Wow, cool! There are a variety of old curricular content which you might be able to source from or add to:

http://publiclab.org/wiki/en/cedro-grassroots-mapping-curriculum
http://publiclab.org/wiki/grassroots-mapping-youth-curriculum (unfinished)

And this one had been more pitched at adults, i think: http://publiclab.org/wiki/grassroots-mapping-curriculum

Thanks for sharing!!!
