Hi Peter...  The main block diagram, shows it.. and some of the project logs indicate it.. and I suppose I could have indicated it better... but the nucleo boards only connect to the raspberry pi through usb (they do not draw power from the raspi, just a usb-serial link)..  the only other interconnect is the reset line from the raspi to the nulceo which isn't really important yet and not necessary or implemented yet...but allows the raspi to reset each nucleo if needed...  

I will make sure to update the documentation to make sure this is more clear...  Thanks :)
