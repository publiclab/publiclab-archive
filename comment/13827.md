From browsing the article, I'd agree that the individual contributors of fluorescence, which when combined produce the broad band spectral curve, do not vary their wavelength based on the stimulus wavelength. However, that does not preclude a variation in what percentage of each fluorescence constituent is activated as dependent upon the stimulus wavelength. Those are two entirely different effects.

[ Their UV source was a PTI LS-100 fluorescence spectrophotometer -- no longer sold. From a google books print, it sounds like a variable-wavelength device which allowed measurement resolutions of 3nm. So, it might not be laser-based, but clearly (from the article, the excitation wavelength could be controlled and, from the google books reference, the bandwidth was relatively narrow (within the resolution of the PLab hardware.]

My perception of the gist of the article is this:

1) Crude oils all generally contain the same (many) types chromophores (absorb light but do not fluoresce) and fluorophores (absorb light and fluoresce) but in differing quantities.

2) The chromophores result in quenching (reduction) the fluorescence from the fluorophores which affect dilute solutions more than neat (un-diluted) samples. The variation in number and ratio of chromophores and fluorophores results in the specific fluorescence intensity for a given UV stimulus.

3) Collisional energy transfer between chromo- and fluoro-phores, which is a function of their concentrations, has a direct influence on the fluorescence spectra which is a function of excitation wavelength -- where longer wavelengths gradually decrease the spectral differences. At shorter (UV) wavelengths the spectral variation with stimulus wavelength is significant. Below are graphs for 30nm, 350nm, 400nm and 470nm excitation wavelengths.

4) There is also a marked difference in spectra between the 'neat' samples and the diluted samples at each stimulus wavelength. This is very important when starting with an unknown, diluted sample. Below: 400nm neat and then 400nm diluted.
