cool opportunity, [@Philrosenberg](/profile/Philrosenberg)!  you may want to share it out with the Public Lab Air Quality list:

[@Marlokeno](/profile/Marlokeno):
The question of what type of fine particles are wetted by humidity is one i have too.  it certainly effects 'droplet mode' particles significantly, and they make up the bulk of fine particles. Whether it also effects 'dust mode' particles directly, I'm not sure.

This issue cuts to the heart of the difficulties in monitoring silica dust emissions-- the silica can be a fraction of the fine particles, and yet also a health risk.  Days with high measurements fine particles  (PM2.5, for instance) won't necessarily correspond with days of high silica.  Some minimal speciation, identifying between dust and droplets (even if silica isn't positively identified) would be illuminating.
