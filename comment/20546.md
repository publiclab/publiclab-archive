Hey [@jeffalk](/profile/jeffalk) . I am well aware that the Purple Air data sheets are logged in units µg/m3. I referenced [airnow.gov](https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=topics.about_airnow) that has conversion calculators from concentrations into an AQI range. As explained in my post, I used these calculators to convert the concentrations into an AQI range estimation. 

I've worked with the air forecasters at the RI Department of Environmental management quite a bit at this point. My understanding of the forecasting process is that they use data from FEM monitors (hourly averages) sensor, to broadcast the air quality forecasts on their websites at the end of each hour. 

Besides, even if the AQI standard is meant to reflect a 24 hour average, I think a 1-hour average probably contains more useful information about what's in the air at different times of the day - which is what i want to know.
