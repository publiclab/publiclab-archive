Yes, this is a good topic. I did some work on this; maybe it will help.

First, the 'size' of the spectrometer (the PLab type) is mostly decided by the camera (w/grating) and the slit -- where the camera is supposed to be focused on the slit. These small webcams cannot effectively focus below about 4-in and the best I could do while obtaining a resonably sharp focus (and the best resolution for a given slit width) was about 6 inches. [ Note: The PLab instructions (the one's I received) are actually wrong for the electrical box housing design as the focus is far out past the distance to the slit.

Next, yes, ambient light is potentially a sever factor and the "double-slit" does help. However, be aware that it is actually NOT a double-slit (it's just a convenient naming) but it is one slit plus one or more "baffles". The camera cannot focus on two sequential slits and, if in fact you really did have 2 slits, there would be distortion as a result. If the 'chambers' between the slit and the baffle is made of VERY non-reflective material, and the camera 'chamber' is VERY non reflective it does help to eliminate significant 'fuzzyness' in the camera image.

I have previously noted this in discussions and it would be really good to have a 2nd generation PLab spectrometer designed with a slit and a baffle with VERY good non-reflective internal material. (Note, the input "port" on the present PLab electrical box housing is actually quite reflective and does add ambient noise even though the black paper box inside is fairly dark. This is mostly because the reflection angles are fairly shallow relative to the incoming light.)
