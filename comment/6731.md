We do, I just put up the Arduino code - 

https://github.com/Photosynq - see the "Arduino Protocols" repository.  It's still very under development, but the most recent code is working well.

It only has fluorescence measurements as part of it and it's a bit messy (I'm not a coder by nature, so I could use some lessons in improving my code comments...).  I also made a program to combine many different output data files together for the photobioreactor, otherwise for longer experiments you can have way too many files to process manually.    Next step is to add code to take measurements with the CO2 sensor, temp/humidity, and light sensor.

Venturit, the company working on the website, and Talia who's doing the app are both going to post their code on the website soon (I've told them to do it and they have access, they just haven't put it up yet).  

We tried to fork spectralworkbench.org but the guys doing the website felt it would be easier to start from scratch.  It'll be pretty similar in the end, though, and I think that there'll still be a lot of usable code between the two.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
