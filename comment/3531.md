Pat,

I have a couple of questions about your experience:

- what is your opinion about SX260 battery duration when gps is set to on (a weak point of my SX230 compared to my Sony DSC-HX5)?

- were you able to set off the gps using <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/939465/Drone.bas">drone.bas</a> (chdk intervalometer script) from conservationdrones.org?

Thanks.

Juan
