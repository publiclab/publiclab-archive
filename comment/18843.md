There are several other previous questions that discuss this.  But crazy is is correct, all tds meters are conductivity meters. One side note- there are two different tds scales.  So while the conductivity should read similarly, the tds may not.

The circuit in the old conductivity meter was basically an ac generator (running at 10 kh z if memory is correct) feeding a Wheatstone bridge.  The two solution electrodes were one leg of the bridge.  The resistances of the legs were adjusted until an a.c. Voltmeter read zero.  
What the circuits are now, I don't know.
