Hi, [@500swapnil](/profile/500swapnil) - yes, it would be great to see OAuth integration both before summer (in some form, at least a start) and also broken out as solvable tasks in the proposal. 

Milestone 13 is also a priority! We'd love to see a proposal built around some of those -- they do need unpacking though, as there are many parts to it!
