Hi Ned
thanks for your research! Is great this information.
i have two doubts. First if i use a red filter how should be the formula  (blue - red) / (blue+red) ? Because i'm not shure but in the red chanel we have red +nir data??
And the second doubt is wich software you are using to calculate the indexs?
