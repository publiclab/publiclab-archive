Hello [@asmaibrahim657](/profile/asmaibrahim657), thank you for your proposal! I'll leave a few comments and points of feedback here!

I like the thought you're putting into the Q&A section but wanted to warn you that the Q&A is produced using an iFrame containing this URL: https://publiclab.org/embed/grid/question:infragram

and so therefore our ability to change the design or layout of that page is quite limited. The page is generated in this repository: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/ and while we could initiate a change over there, the Q&A feature is also used in other places, like here: https://jywarren.github.io/fisheyegl/example/ and so any changes we propose will have to work on other sites as well. That's OK - we can still, for example, put the iFrame in a popup modal window, or a sidebar, or other options, but it is not completely customizable. 

As to your mockup, i really like some of the ideas you're showing, like putting the Q&A at bottom, like having a drag and drop symbol in the middle. Have you thought about which Bootstrap elements you'l be using for each section, and how they'll adapt to different screen sizes? https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/

Thank you!
