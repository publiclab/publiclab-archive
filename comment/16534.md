> Hi, just on an order issue, this is somewhat lower priority, so could we put it later in the proposal?
Sign Up Offers to auto subscribe you to the tags you were looking at - 2 weeks

Done.

> Regarding Griddler - sounds great! The Mailman tutorial i referenced was from 2012 -- whoa. Thanks for the research.

Thank you :)

> Also - how can we test that out? Can you find some examples of testing Griddler controllers as we test the email sending controllers? 

I have updated the gist with a test.

>For Notification Preferences for Users -- could we use UserTags, which is a system that already exists, but lacks a good interface? It needs some work but let's try to fix and use that infrastructure instead of creating a new one.

subscription_mailer#notify_node_creation uses `Tag.subscribers(node.tags)` on line 9 which uses UserTags internally. I only introduced a delay on notify_node_creation method. So I think we are good here.

> Regarding the last two, I think we'd need to think about how to write tests for both of these. But your approach sounds good in both cases!

I have written the tests in the gist. Thank you for the kind words.
