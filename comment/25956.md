Hi [@francesco49](/profile/francesco49)

I'm moving this response over from a duplicate question not sure you've seen it?

We shouldn't need install a driver to use the USB cameras-- we generally open whatever photo capture program is already available on a computer and select "usb camera" (default is usually you computer's own camera). On Macs we use Photobooth, but if you don't have any kind of photo capture software on your computer, there are also lots of open source options that might help you out here: https://alternativeto.net/software/photo-booth/

I'm curious if you're getting an error message that is asking you to install drivers? Or an error code of some sort? If you share that here we can also take a look to see if we can diagnose. Thanks for reaching out!
