I think the simple answer might be: in the long run, very possibly yes! but its not yet technologically feasible.

From matt zumwalt at IPFS: 

in order to achieve HIPAA compliance on a decentralized network you need (as a baseline) 1. a HIPAA compliant regime for encryption, decryption, and key management and 2. HIPAA compliant facilities for storage. Protocol Labs will start pushing for someone to tackle the first part (encryption, etc) soon, but it might take s very long time to implement and audit
