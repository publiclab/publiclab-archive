Microplastics could be used as epoxy filler to make industrial products that don't end up in ocean, such as picnic benches, decks, picture frames.  There are social behaviors that could use some modification to prevent them from getting to ocean, and much more could be done to pressure plastic/petroleum companies to be responsible in their cradle to cradle manufacturing or production.
