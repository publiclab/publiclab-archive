Hi [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke), sorry for responding late, I was in a temple with no internet access in the passing week. Yes, I've seen that page and I thought I've edit a little bit :) I used to scope for different quick water test tools (in 2013), and just uploaded to a open google spreadsheet here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dznrZd_Zlhle5wgt622zNt5T8yxUpWeog6Nb-QQRAes/edit?usp=sharing 
This one is pretty comprehensive. My reference is Chinese drinking water standard and surface water standard,  since the test limitations are pretty different, so I divided into 2 forms. For each items in the standard, I search for the possible testing method, in China and globally. The Chinese companies are always the cheapest. Just to note that most of the info are in Chinese (I did little translation though..), and the info might be out of date.
