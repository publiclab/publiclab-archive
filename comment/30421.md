Environmental Science an interdisciplinary study that has many categories, all in which cover natural science used by scientists to improve and protect the environment. Environmental science is not only important to me but should also be to everyone because we can study it and use what we learned to impact our future. We can clean up the mess that we made and protect animals from the harm that we cause. Another reason it’s important is because we can protect beautiful species from going extinct from low food, low water, or being hunted to extinction. Lastly and most importantly, we need environmental science to understand how our resources are being affected. We all need clean air, clean water, and food that’s not contaminated. It’s a subject that everyone should be concerned about, and you don’t need to be a scientist to get into environmental science.
