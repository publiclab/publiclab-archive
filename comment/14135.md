NDVI is based solely on color (near infrared is one of the colors). If a camera records different colors for two  leaves, the NDVI computed for those leaves will probably differ. The color captured by a camera depends on the surface properties (spectral reflection and absorption) of objects in the scene and also the color and angle of the light illuminating the surface. To detect differences in the reflective and absorptive properties of objects, the light illuminating the scene must be constant. If the light is not constant, the change must be accounted for. Accounting for changing light conditions is done by "calibrating" the process.

One process of calibration requires that special surfaces (calibration targets) of known spectral reflectivity be included in the photographs. The color of all pixels in a photograph is adjusted based on the color of pixels in those targets. Some research notes at Public Lab describe the development of a procedure for calibrating the process, and a plugin for Fiji automates the process. There are still issues with the procedure, and no tests have been described which demonstrate that NDVI derived from the calibration process is always robust. Without calibration, interpreting the meaning of NDVI values should be limited to very general patterns.

It is easy to make new color look up tables (luts) in Fiji. When an image with a lut applied is displayed in Fiji, open the lut editor (Image/Color/Edit lut). Below is a lut in the editor which shows color only for the NDVI values between 0.38 and 0.5.

Almost every color used can be distinguished, so leaves with NDVI values of 0.4 could be distinguished from leaves with values of 0.45. With a series of calibrated NDVI images, this lut could allow a visualization of plants becoming stressed (assuming NDVI of 0.5 is not stressed and NDVI of 0.4 is stressed, and that leaves in the scene have NDVI values in that range).
