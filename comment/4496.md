I definitely want some Rosco [#2007](/n/2007)!

this is a great idea, it seems like what we need to do is find or make a custom white balance card for the Rosco, or really any filter we choose.  I couldn't find any commercial products in a quick search, but will keep looking.  Making our own would be tedious, but pretty straight forward:

a quick google search is telling me that a lot of work has been done characterizing the IR spectra of paint pigments, probably for forensics and art restoration.   We should be able to work backwards from pigment spectra to paint mixtures to actually printing a white balance card.

check out this great presentation on Medieval painting.  We still use the same pigments in paints, so its applicable overview of some of the work out there:
