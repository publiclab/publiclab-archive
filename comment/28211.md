I took a quick look through the current permit, and it looks like the advice from others to get legal help is a great one! What I did notice is the types of pollutants that they need to supposedly monitor in their waste emissions- like H2S (hydrogen sulfide). If you have already been doing some monitoring and have data (from an accredited lab ideally with proper chain of command so that they cannot discredit it) that could show that they have not been meeting these requirements then this could be a strong case for intervention from regulatory bodies. If you have any questions about the science side of the different pollutants, limits for them in air, water, soil, health effects etc I would be happy to more thoroughly workshop it together and I did get some other environmental toxicologists on board.
