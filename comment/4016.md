a couple of ideas; you could use a beam splitter to combine two cameras. good ones are expensive but a cheap acrylic one might be good enough. You might also consider using a piece of nitinol (muscle) wire to move a filter. That would probably be my first choice. If you can come up with a lever to minimize travel that would make it easy to do it in the time required.
