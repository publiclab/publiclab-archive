Thanks, [@Dave-O](/profile/Dave-O) ! We did some side by side testing of this method next to an EPA approved method and we found these tubes to be cross contaminated by acetone and acetaldehyde, and these Draeger tubes may as well. Here's the note: https://publiclab.org/notes/gretchengehrke/10-07-2015/formaldehyde-measurement-testing-public-lab-s-kit-with-doh-s-equipment and since then we've started development on a new system https://publiclab.org/notes/nshapiro/10-17-2016/public-lab-awarded-nsf-funding-to-help-develop-low-cost-community-formaldehyde-monitoring-technique Jeff just wrote up a new study design for HCHO if you've got some HCHO that you're interested in assessing https://publiclab.org/notes/nshapiro/10-17-2016/public-lab-awarded-nsf-funding-to-help-develop-low-cost-community-formaldehyde-monitoring-technique
