Thanks Warren. This is actually the second spectrometer I have built. The first was part of my thesis and used 1.5" PVC and a hacked point-and-shoot camera. I have another one in the works that is controlled by an Arduino and uses the sensor out of a barcode scanner.

Some printers can do a very good job at printing slits but even the good ones tend to vary a bit which can make the spectral lines fuzzy. Cutting with a saw isn't too bad but the slit is still a bit wider than I like. I found that gluing a pair of single-edged razor blades such that their edges are facing each other and extremely close together can really clean up a spectrum.

I like the idea of a swivel. I may try one out this weekend and see if I can get one to work.

I wanted to add another brace along two of the edges to keep it from sliding around on my phone but worried about it limiting the number people who could use it. We could always make different mounting plates for different devices or make the plate over-sized and include an extra corner piece that could be glued on to make it a custom fit.

Ideas, ideas, and more ideas. This should keep me busy for a while :).
