Hi Neil,

Thanks for your nice comments. Yes, I think the general issue of data quality from citizen science sensors is finally starting to get the attention it deserves. I am encouraged reading about the latest discussions at the Creative Commons meeting and related blog post on this topic, some good ideas there about certification methods and so on. 

I learned early on in my engineering career that if you don't provide a way for a system to be properly calibrated when you design it, then it will never be properly calibrated. So another part of my exercise has been building up various DIY calibration rigs using pre-mixed cal gases and valves and flow sensors and mass flow controllers and so on. I'm still refining and developing and will also be discussing these systems here in future research notes and would love to get feedback from others on how to improve things. 

The general idea is to have the calibration rig talk to the sensor board to perform various auto-calibration routines. Yes, the Alphasense sensors are calibrated to within 1% at the factory, but as I mentioned it's never that simple. For example the AFE chip's TIA feedback resistors have a tolerance of 5%. Ooops! So that's another thing to do, figure out how to precisely characterize the board itself and collect metadata that can (mostly) subtract these errors back out of the signal. I have a general plan for all of this but there are still details to sort out.
