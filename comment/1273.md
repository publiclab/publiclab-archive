Hi Ola,
I don't think we have a pre-made flyer available.  I have a ton of public laboratory graphics-- tell me what you need and I'll upload them.

if you're handy with a graphics program, logos and other things can be pulled and copied off of Grassroots Mapping Forum, the PDF of which is available here:
https://publiclab.org/sites/default/files/GM_Forum2_small.pdf

we make most of our [guides](https://publiclab.org/wiki/guides) as Google docs to aide others in editing.  If you have the time to make a google docs flyer, I'm sure it would help others as well.

good luck! I'll be heading through Lund on my way to Växjö for Christmas-- I hope I see a balloon out the train window ;-)
