It's worth a try.  Please let me know how it works out.  Please double check, but the nav beacons should be between 108 mhz and 118 mhz.  

Some departments were keeping up with snow levels with meteor scatter.  They were using RF  on a relatively low freq. around 40 mhz.  This was done from the western half of the US. Can't tell you the exact frequency or if it's still active.   This would be a better system of its still around.

The eastern half of the US decided cell phones were better.
