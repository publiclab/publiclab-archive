Biology is the study of life and the ecosystems that it lives in. 

Biotic is all the living factors in an ecosystem. 

Abiotic is all the nonliving factors in an ecosystem. 

 

Interdependent: every living organism depends on other living organisms to live. That is called interdependency.  

Biomes are large groups of similar ecosystems. All the organisms in a biome live and thrive in a specially balanced environment. 

A hydrosphere is the marine ecosystems on earth. 

Animals that can survive in salt water cannot survive in fresh water and the same for freshwater animals 

 

There are 7,969,216,506 people on planet earth. 

779,744,072 people are without access to a clean drinking water source. 

 

71% of the earthâ€™s surface is water. Only 3% of that water is drinkable.
