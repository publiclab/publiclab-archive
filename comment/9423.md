Well I like the angle in part because it seems convenient for viewing on a table or countertop... Almost like a lectern. And we can adhere a phone case to the front so its a snug fit. Also, we (Mathew and i) wanted this design to be workable for a phone or a webcam. But if we wanted to reposition, a mirror could maybe be inserted? Actually if we had good enough mirrors we could make the whole thing more compact by reflecting back and forth in a chamber. But then it'd be significantly harder to build and the required materials would be more of a barrier.
