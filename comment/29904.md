Hi again! I reached out to Fractracker to see if they had any insight, and got some helpful pointers. Please let me know if you'd like any connections to the orgs listed.

"Aerial footage has been incredibly powerful. Furthermore, monitoring ideas using simple particulate samplers come to mind. I'm sure the blasting must aerosolize a suspension of dust particles. Also, decibel meters to monitor noise at property lines.

As for accessing federal regulatory bodies... I would reach out to The Center for Biological Diversity and Earthjustice. They have had some great luck getting the EPA to inspect injection wells and Class II exemption permitting in CA. These seem similar to the cases mentioned - instances where the state regulator was not fulfilling their obligations of primacy. "
