right, a true control test, where there is certain to be no H2S. 

At least light leaks would be easy to solve with a capsule redesign if it turns out they are a problem.

I have the H2S electronic sensor and Cort (from Parts & Crafts) set it up with a temp/humidity sensor. It would be cool to prototype but unfortunately the digital sensor draws a lot of power (prob. couldn't be left out?) and also is only sensitive to 5ppm minimum (http://figarosensor.com/products/825pdf.pdf)

So is it still helpful for any applications you're working on?
