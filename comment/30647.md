Ogallala or the High Plains Aquifer is considered the largest aquifer in the world. An aquifer is a body of water that is contained underground by permeable rock layers. This aquifer is in Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. People are concerned about the Ogallala aquifer because more water is taken out than water going in it and it is a very important water source to many states. The primary use of the Ogallala aquifer in Nebraska is to provide water for residential, industrial, and agricultural use. If we continue this course, our biggest natural freshwater resource in America will deplete.
