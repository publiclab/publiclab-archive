Hi, i know it's been a while, but curious how this has gone? I was wondering if it'd be possible to trigger a trail camera by flashing an LED in frame, kind of like how Chris is saying with a servo. 

I'm just thinking a blinking LED could be a lot lower power, and maybe could even be adhered to the camera up close, so it wouldn't need to be too bright. 

Also just wanted to loop in [@stevie](/profile/stevie), [@bkleist](/profile/bkleist), and [@glennwalquist](/profile/glennwalquist), and others who've been testing out timelapse cameras at sites of environmental problems.

Thanks!
