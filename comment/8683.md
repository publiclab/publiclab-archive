Jeff, I constructed a few more slotted filters which just bend a bit and fit in front of the smartphone slit. The camera focus difficulty limits the size of the slots because of blur. This then directly relates to the area of the light source -- which can illuminate multiple slots (i.e. of potentially varying attenuation). Since "wide" light sources are easier, the best option would be to have the camera pre-set to the slit's distance (or as close as possible) and leave it fixed -- since there would be no reason to want blur. Then, the slot dimensions could be further reduced which allows smaller-area light sources to illuminate multiple slots. I've still not found a regular camera app that provides manual control over focus to allow the experiment. I'm wondering if there is a technical reason why manual focus is not available in camera apps -- perhaps because mechanical constraints; but just guessing as I don't know how they accomplish focus. Seems odd though.
