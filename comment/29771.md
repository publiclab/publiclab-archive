Jaida Manson 3/11/21 - I had fun using the water trawl to collect microplastics. It wasn't how I thought it was going to be. I mostly saw candy wrappers, soda cans, and plastic bags. I will take many years for these items to disintegrate. Communities are affected by these water ways because they can cause fatal diseases caused by the bacteria. These polluted waterways also provide undrinkable water to the community.
