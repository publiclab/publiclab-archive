Thanks for your reply [@stoft](/profile/stoft). The light source is a fluorescent tube (there aren't any CFLs available here). I also have a green flashlight and my phone's white flashlight which give different (blurry) spectra. Moving the spectrometer further away from the source doesn't seem to diminish the width or blurriness of the peaks, just reduce their intensity (which is still a good thing). I'm using the 0.4mm acetate slit included in the kit and a DVD diffraction grating that I washed with ethanol to remove the purple pigment. 

I've adjusted the camera's focus with a barcode such that it's focused around the slit distance, but it's a bit difficult to do due to the low resolution of the camera (there's a point where the barcode isn't clearly visible because there aren't enough pixels, not actually due to the focus). Out of desperation I've gradually rotated the focus on each side of that focal point with no success. I followed the instructions manual and it's a pretty simple thing, I just don't understand why it won't resolve into peaks like all the spectra I've seen posted with the instrument. The only thing I can think of to try is cut out another piece of the DVD.

This is an unclipped spectrum of my phone's white flashlight
