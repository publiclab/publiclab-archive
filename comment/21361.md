[@liz](/profile/liz) it would be super cool to have a module where the participants could build it this way, and then *add components* or otherwise *change the circuit* to achieve those slower clicks!

* Just building the circuit is like, ok that's pretty cool, but what's the point of building one vs buying something already put together
* Showing how easy it is to modify a homebuilt circuit is like opening a whole new world - if you can build it and understand it, you can do anything!

One thing i unexpectedly really liked about the current high pitched nonsense is that, when first built with the photodiode, and brought gradually from the shade into the sunlight, we heard it rise and rise in pitch - until it seemed to drop down again an octave or two, and start rising again. Is was really cool and we all wondered why it did that.
