I think this is great. I'd mentioned to [@liz](/profile/liz) but the question [How can i know if my plant-based air filter is working?](https://publiclab.org/questions/liz/09-26-2016/how-can-i-know-if-my-plant-based-air-filter-is-working) is great, and I think it'd be excellent to note it (and the multiple answers to that question in this activity -- even briefly.

As to some kind of simple "hello world" test to confirm you've done this activity successfully, what do you think -- listen or feel for airflow with your finger or ear, somewhere? That way, "successful reproduction" of this activity doesn't have to encompass a topic as big as "how do I measure improved air quality" -- which could be left to a followup test. 

Just thinking about how to acknowledge the ways of knowing, and make them distinct from the questions we're hoping to answer! Great work here, Nick!
