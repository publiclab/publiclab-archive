Hi Jeff - The electronic sensor would be great. I understand that the results may not be completely conclusive on their own - but I was more interested in seeing if I could repeat the experiment <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2004/em/b400746h/unauth">here</a>. - Anaerobic decomposition seemed to be the only safe way to generate hydrogen sulfide. I've observed the color change exhibited by strips when exposed to light and would like to see if a chemical response is expressed differently. My main goal was to control light here (which seems to be the variable which will most likely skew results), gain [some] understanding as to length of exposure (not specified in procedure linked), and have some comparative results. 

But yes, results from the electronic sensor would be necessary for an experiment which would stand on it's own.
