Hi everyone, thank you for such a beautifully documented activity! I'm going to print this out on oversized paper so that there's room to write translations. The next step would be to capture the translations digitally, and for this i'm wondering if you could link a collaboratively-editable document that people could type directly into? For example, as this guide project does:  https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-01-2017/collaboratively-write-the-new-pocket-guide-to-grassroots-mapping
