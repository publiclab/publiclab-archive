Getting a hold of the USP used to be difficult and expensive.  While current USP may still be expensive, here is a source for older versions.  "Pharmacopeia Online" is the place to go.  Put in USP31 and then search for <1231>. This is still a very large monograph.   Go to the subtitle "Chemical Considerations" for explanations of why chemical tests were dropped and TOC and conductivity was added.  As a subnote, the increased sensitivity of TOC has shown some extractables from Objective-C noted in this paragraph.
