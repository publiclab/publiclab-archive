Hi [@Rick88](/profile/Rick88) your image looks OK - but your infrared image may benefit from being white balanced - there are some good resources here at [#white-balance](/tag/white-balance).

That said, the easiest way to know if your basic technique is working well is to look at an area of very consistent vegetation - grass, for example - and see if you can see variation in the image then. The leaves you're looking at are in various lighting situations and angles, so it's a little harder to pull out useful information. Hope that helps!
