I can't speak to bots , but comments tend to be a pretty powerful way to swing local issues.  The best combo for us has been a bunch of people  who can speak from the heart (with a little bit of specificity), paired with one or two voices who can speak the language of the decision-makers  (and thus can help to clearly lay out an alternate vision so the deciders don't have to do that much thinking about it).
