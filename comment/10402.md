In numpy, it'd be fairly easy.

        # establish that x and y are 1d vectors
        xdata = data[0,:]
        ydata = data[1,:]
        # perform cumulative scalar integration over left riemann sum
        accumintegral = numpy.diff(xdata).prod(ydata[:-1]).cumsum()
        # the last value in accumintegral is the full area under the curve.
        target = accumintegral[-1]/2.0
        # find the first x-value for which the accumulated integration exceeds half the total integral
        return xdata[accumintegral >= target][0]
