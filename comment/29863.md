Native refers to be associated with since birth. Indigenous means to naturally occur in a particular area. Something indigenous will typically be native to its area. Something that is native is not necessarily indigenous. 

 

Three invasive and nonnative aquatic organisms in Louisiana include the Chub Shiner (Notropis potteri), the Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthhys molitrix), and alligator weed.  The silver carp are known to have been causing “enormous damage to native species”. Though it has not yet been determined, both the Chub Shiner and Silver Carp pose threats to their nonnative food webs and ecosystems. When they enter where they do not belong, resources can become scarce. Alligator weed makes it difficult for wildlife to access the edges of water sources. This poses a threat to the survival of wildlife because it creates an obstacle between them and a source of life.
