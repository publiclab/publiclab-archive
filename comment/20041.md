OK - that's OK, the camera should be looking at the dark inside surface of the lid. The grating or DVD should bend/refract the light downward into the lens -- this is why i'm concerned about the orientation of the grating. 

For a DVD, it's easy to see when the curved outer edge of the disc is at the top of the box. For film gratings, this is harder to determine, but you can try rotating it 90Â° and trying it both ways -- it has a directionality, basically.
