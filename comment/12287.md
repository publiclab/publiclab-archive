QR code libraries are available in many languages, and most QR code libraries will probably return a location of the center of the code. But maybe not an orientation. So I figure repeating the QR code with samples along the axis at known distances (say, every 20% of the way between the two targets) is an easy standard to stick to, with some futureproofing. How does that sound? Any preferred ordering of the patches? 

I'll probably do a version in JavaScript.
