Hi Scott, It might be possible to calibrate a camera using a single color like a white balance card but at the very least you would need to know the reflectance value of the card and you would need to characterize your camera. The second step is the tricky part and the process I'm developing requires a few colors to do the characterization. I am trying to work on this calibration issue but have been distracted with other tasks and there are some issues in the calibration process that I'm trying to better understand so progress is slow. Some of my results are puzzling so I'm trying to get a better handle on cause and effect.
So the simple answer to your question is "no". For now, if you want to use a white balance card I'd use the methods Chris Fastie has outlined in previous posts. That (and histogram stretching) is more of a relative calibration but it can be used to make useful images.
