Hi Brent,

Did you end up fixing the problem you described? I have exactly the same problem. Pointing my camera directly at a light source shows a white image, so I know that's working.

I've spent a while trying out different angles for the camera, but the light is just not getting to the camera in the case.

Thanks.
