1) If 2 tags belong to same node , they have an edge between them ?

The tags don't belong to nodes, the nodes are actually the tags themselves.  Each "tag node" as it were, has an edge between them when they occur on the same page on the plots website.  I believe that goes for any page be it a research note or a wiki page.  Take the [following page](https://publiclab.org/questions/tommystyles/10-20-2017/need-your-feedback-on-tag-pages) (whoa meta) for example:  Here you see the tags are:

The nodes are: 

website
design
tags

The un-directed edges are:

website <-> design
website <-> tags
design <-> tags

2.) The different colors is for different types of node like questions , notes , research-notes , etc . ?

The colors relate to the "community" the nodes (tags) belong to.  Take a look at this [image](https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/09-15-2016/first-draft-of-tag-graph#c15404) [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) posted:
