Just to expand on this, LEL is designed to be a common, standard back-end to present a lot of these layers on the same interactive map with minimum code. It does not have a huge UI component, and that's both something we assume a given website would build out, AND/OR something we're hoping to help provide within the library as it grows. It'd be great to co-imagine what kind of interactivity the data would have -- would it have popups? Would it open related resources, articles, links, display nearby projects... when browsing through different regions?
