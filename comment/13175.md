Thanks for this clever design! I made this using my Portrait and the only cardstock I had handy: pink. After assembly, I covered the outside in black electrical tape to block light. I tried to follow the instructions to make the grating from a DVD-R, and I think it worked. 

However, I don't see a spectrum! Since I'm a complete noob at this, I don't know where to look or what to look for. I have looked all over this (brilliant) site, but can't seem to find a picture of anyone using this device with the naked eye. At what angle and where should I look for the spectrum? I've tried pointing the slit at everything from the sun to a candle. Looking thru the grating, I can see the light slot, I can see the light hitting the inside surface of the tube (as a nice line), but I don't see a spectrum. Can you give me some direction? Thanks for any help.
