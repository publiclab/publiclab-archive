Thanks. Yes, the camera has virtually no relative sensitivity outside 400-700nm. This does need to be differentiated from observing a bright source outside that range where some signal may be observable -- i.e. measuring attenuation of a fluid using a bright 350nm source might be possible. The point to take from this gain-correction is that without a truely 'flat' light source, 400-700nm is really the limit for corrected spectra.
