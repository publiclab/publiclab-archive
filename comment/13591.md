Hi!

Thank you very much for your answers!
I have downloaded Fiji and it's plugin and will test as soon as possible. 
This weekend I am going to make some aerial shots and will try the calibration process.

[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie), the blue is well separated but the green and red are very close of each other in the last IR picture (the calibrated one). Do you think I need to teak the white balance a bit more to improve the result?
