Thanks!! and also feeling great that you liked my proposal.

Custom Inserts Ideas
1. Custom Font-size and Font-colour:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fWQVquIX-zPozz6fR4TTOIVbmFhPmQAZ/view

2. Customs insert for the table: Merge cell and unmerge cell, add row and column after the initial table has been inserted and CSVparser that can generate table by uploading excel sheet.

3. https://publiclab.org/wiki/inline-maps and https://publiclab.org/
wiki/advanced-grids


Can you just give a priority order of above 3 tasks.

Thanks again!!
