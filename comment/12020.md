this setup will flow 9 liters in 30 minutes, +/- variation in the tubes.  I worked to isolate that variation to the tubes, and [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) and [@nickshapiro](/profile/nickshapiro) can speak to why we don't think that is super important, given published literature.

Upon return I'm planning on checking the flow of all the used tubes and the kit to look at variation and drift, although I'm not expecting any drift.
