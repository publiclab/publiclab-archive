Dr. Beddow's instrumentation students have been building our EDU logger for more than three years and, based on that experience, we've redesigned the classroom model to accommodate a wider range of student projects. A full set of part links & YouTube videos explains the new assembly in enough detail for beginners. We've also released a new "Data logger starter script" which should run on just about any Arduino-based project:

[Pro Mini Logger Project for the Classroom [ EDU v2: 2019 ]](https://thecavepearlproject.org/2019/01/11/pro-mini-logger-project-for-the-classroom-edu-version-2-2019/)

Please pass this along to any STEM educators who would like to add Arduino based experiments to their teaching portfolio.

Cheers!
