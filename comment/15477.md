Hi dddnoob. The code on GitHub was only compatible with Processing 2, which I believe is the cause of the above error. I uploaded a folder to GitHub (https://github.com/SmokyMountainScientific/WheeTrometer_3.0/tree/master/WheeTrometer_GUI_Processing_3). This folder has a Processing 3 compatible GUI. If you still have trouble with it just let me know. 

As for a LabView or other GUI, I don't have one made right now. If you do have access to LabView it would be pretty easy to get a GUI working. You would simply have to set up a serial port to communicate with the microcontroller. Next you would have to send the run parameters to the microcontroller (mode and integration time), next send the go signal ( * ). After that the microcontroller will repeat back the run parameters. Once the parameters are repeated, the microcontroller send an "&" character to make the start of data, then it starts transmitting the raw CCD data. From there you would just have to parse the incoming serial feed and plot the data.
