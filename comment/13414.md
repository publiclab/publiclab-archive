I wanted to verify the paperclip wasn't in danger of shorting anything out inside the camera, so opened it up to find it can come in contact with the battery pack, but the pack is wrapped and nothing looks in danger of causing a problem.

It might be worth ensuring the portion of the clip that passes through the camera is flat as possible, so minimize how much space it takes up, especially when rotating the clip around. 

Here's what is inside:
