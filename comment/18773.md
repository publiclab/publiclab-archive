Awesome [@mridulnagpal](/profile/mridulnagpal) , so what we should do now? Do we need to make a common proposal? And how should we decide on features? 

I think it will be great to make a slack channel for this? What you think? [@warren](/profile/warren) [@mridulnagpal](/profile/mridulnagpal) , please share you point on this
