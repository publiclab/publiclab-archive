Hi! Often the issue is that the ribbon cable is not properly seated, either the big one between the camera and Pi, or the little one between the camera board and the camera component. It could also be improperly oriented (upside down or something) -- there are unfortunately a lot of ways for it to go wrong. 

Another possibility is that there is not enough power to run the camera. Are you sure you're running on a pretty good power source? 

Hope this helps! If you want to upload a photo showing the orientation etc, we may be able to help troubleshoot!
