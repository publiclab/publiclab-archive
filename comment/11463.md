This thread was part of my inspiration to build a few long strings of DS18B20 sensors:

I am trying to improve the calibration of these sensors (from their default +-0.5C) using the ice & steam points of distilled water. I suspect that I will still have to obtain a $500 NIST pt100 to know for sure if the process has worked, but I want to know just how far you can get with DIY approaches. If I can get to +- 0.1 degree accuracy, then the answer to the original posters question about open source is definitely yes.

P.S. I recently deployed a couple of these multi sensor loggers underwater between 10 & 15 m depth. I will be going back to get them in ~6 months, so will be able to say something about the power consumption of these long strings of DS18b20's then.
