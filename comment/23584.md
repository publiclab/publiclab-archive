We've used watercolors, like these, and they work well:&nbsp;[https://www.amazon.com/Pebeo-Colorex-Watercolor-Bottle-Dropper/dp/B005MQODAA/](https://www.amazon.com/Pebeo-Colorex-Watercolor-Bottle-Dropper/dp/B005MQODAA/) and [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005SBVXCA/](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005SBVXCA/)

  

beet juice is nice because it doesn't kill the cells, though i dunno which usual dyes do or don't harm microorganisms...&nbsp;

  

I also don't know if some cells like to eat the beet juice :-)
