Hi Chris,

you are right, the settings are important too. I absolutely forgot to mention them. Here is a (translated) snapshot of the settings:

[![camera_settings.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/446/large/camera_settings.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/446/original/camera_settings.jpg)

I used the PLab spectrometry kit 3.0 and worked with the same settings for all of today's spectra. I don't know the brand of the USB webcam that belongs to the kit but for the settings it uses a Dell webcam Central program that was delivered with my notebook. The slit width is 0.4 mm, the grating is a normal DVD.

I was astonished, too, about the gray overexposure output but perhaps I might get different outputs with different settings. I will publish any further results as I stumble upon them.
