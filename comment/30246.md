Hi [@jdetka](/profile/jdetka), this question by [@patalbright](/profile/patalbright) and the comments section might have some tips to try: [How to find the sweet spot for manual white balance settings using Pi NoIR and a blue filter with artificial (full spectrum) lighting](https://publiclab.org/questions/patalbright/10-20-2020/how-to-find-the-sweet-spot-for-manual-white-balance-settings-using-pi-noir-and-a-blue-filter-with-artificial-full-spectrum-lighting)

There's also some more information on white balance and NDVI here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/infrablue-white-balance
