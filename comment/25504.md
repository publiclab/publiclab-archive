Is there any difference between using two filters and using one filter if both photos are exposed so the photos have the same general brightness? In other words, can't you get the same exposure result with one filter and thereby make a photo with a higher shutter speed, smaller aperture, and/or lower ISO, any of which will improve image quality?
