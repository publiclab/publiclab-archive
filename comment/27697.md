Hi [@Stevenlee](/profile/Stevenlee), we don't expect to have this up in the store until mid-December at the earliest, maybe January, but there are a bunch of resources online and I'm happy to chat offline if you need specific support. It's a pretty simple build if you wanted to construct one yourself, but there are some other considerations—connecting with a lab, raising $ for sample analysis, etc— that can be challenging. Happy to talk more.   https://publiclab.org/wiki/bucket-monitor

We are doing an OpenHour call on the bucket on December 9, when we'll have folks on who have used it extensively and may be able to answer your questions directly.  If you need help getting oriented or have questions, I would strongly recommend attending!
