The rubber band won't work very well for sealing the bottom of the cannister, but a hood could be constructed to shield the holes, and held in place by the rubber band.  I'll mock something up.

I also considered placing the strips in the cannister so that the emulsion side is up, and light wouldn't get on it.  This could potentially mitigate light problems as well.
