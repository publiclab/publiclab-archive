Hi Warren, the links that I have found not to work are both on the page at: http://publiclab.org/wiki/dsk

They are:
"grey box" 2.0 version: desktop-kit-instructions-0.4.pdf (200 kB)
Insert for cutting out of stiff matte black card paper: http://old.publiclab.org/sites/default/files/desktop-spec-insert-1.1.pdf

Scaling is good, but I'd also like some more information on how one arrives at the numbers, as well as just the number. For instance, if the scale I gauge by sight is right, why is it that we focus the camera at 9 inches so it focuses on the slit, even though the slit is less than 9 inches away from the camera? Does the diffraction grating significantly alter the focal length? Or are we trying to focus on some point beyond the slit? I suppose I'm after some more technical details about the workings of the machine, rather than just relying on correct scaling. Not that the scaling you provide is bad, I'd just like to understand better.
