I love the idea of a Dylos synced with a timelapse. We've been working on timelapse stuff over at the [photo monitoring page](/wiki/photo-monitoring) and are also talking with the folks who made this for syncing timelapse video with sensor data: https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/01-10-2017/shenangochannel-org-a-dashboard-for-monitoring-and-sharing

What's your Dylos setup like?
