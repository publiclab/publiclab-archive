Hi wmacfarl ,

I've been thinking about affordable ways to calibrate diy photometric devices without having to use commercial standards like formazin or polymer suspensions.

It is very important that the calibration technique is accessible so that it can be reproduced by others using other instruments so that the results can be compared.

An alternative would be to express the readings always with reference to distilled water readings (a more accessible material): Abs (sample) / Abs (distilled water)

But found an interesting tip in the paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067218300762

The authors suggest the use of neutral filters, widely used in photography.

These filters have known transmittance and could be used to calibrate DIY photometers.

I haven't read yet all the paper in detail, but I intend to evaluate this alternative to the photometer I'm mounting.

I hope it helps.

Best regards,
Markos
