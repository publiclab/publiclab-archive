Sounds like we'll actually be deploying one of these in the field soon, as part of WI frac sand efforts. Very exciting!
I went ahead and bought this [$20 silicone housing](https://www.mobius-actioncam.com/store/products/weather-cover-wreplaceable-windows/). First step is to deploy it as a base kit version, stock battery, at 6min intervals (the shortest allowed in power saving mode).

It looks like Wonder Woman's jet, doesn't it?

Comes with clear acrylic lenses.

It's clearly designed for mounting on a helmet, or some less-than-long-term application, as it's open on the bottom. But I'm hoping this will actually survive, maybe with some tape on the bottom to prevent condensation?

The other method is to use clear glass flashlight "lens" as a way to peek out of a waterproof container, such as a mason jar. Mount the clear disk to a hole drilled in the lid, and seal with silicone adhesive.
