Ha! I like the name "Gumby rigs". Thanks for the link to the Becot design, that gives me some ideas for the future. Spinning was the main problem on our first flight because I was using a Picavet on a balloon with no wind to speak of so I had no horizontal distance between the attachment points. The spinning caused almost a third of our images to be too blurry to use. On the flight for which I used the above design, it certainly did spin, but not fast enough to blur so we were able to use 100% of the images. As you mentioned, the vane did make it "ping pong" back and forth as it hit the tether but it was never fast enough to cause problems. Under different wind conditions, we might not be as lucky. We were experiencing wind on the ground between still and 2MPH but it was quite above that (don't know how much) at 50m and above. If someone needs constant orientation, this design probably would not work without modification. But since we were taking many images and stitching in software, my only concern was blurriness. Thanks again for the tips!
