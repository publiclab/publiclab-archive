That is a good looking image. You are correct that this image paints everything with a narrow range of colors, which means that most of the NDVI values for different surfaces are similar (between -0.2 and +0.2). There a few possible reasons for this.

+ Some cameras do a better job than others. What camera are you using?
+ White balance can make a big difference. Does your camera allow custom white balance presets? Was this done?
+ The lighting for the scene can make a difference. Was it sunny, cloudy, bright, dim?  


In general, troubleshooting Infrablue results is more productive if lots of information is available. Check our [this note for guidelines](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/07-17-2013/infrablue-minutiae).

Also, you can drag a few photos into the note, like the original infragram, or add a link to the Infragram.org page with your results.
