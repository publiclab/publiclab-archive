>  reuse of popular tags

for sure -- hoping to have a "recent" or "popular" tags, and maybe eventually a "suggested" tags, though that's technically more difficult, but potentially possible as part of one of the GSoC projects this summer (see below).

> streamlined landing page for new users where they can see some popular tags to browse

Great idea; I believe this may be in the scope for [@Ujitha](/profile/Ujitha)'s project this summer, here: https://publiclab.org/notes/Ujitha/03-12-2016/advanced-searching-and-sorting-tool-for-publiclab-org -- Ujitha, perhaps we can develop a section of your work plan for a topics listing page based on tagging?

> "tools to encourage authors to invite others into their work"

There are several ideas:

* helpful reminders/tips to ask questions others may be able to help you with
* show what prerequisite materials you need to do something
* posing "tests" or "challenges" (which [@liz](/profile/liz) wants to rename)
* encouraging folks to reproduce your work with an "I reproduced this" button
* even publishing as a draft and soliciting input/review [as discussed in the comments of this post](/notes/liz/04-21-2016/comment-piece-in-nature-about-peer-review)

Re: WYSIWYG - definitely, that's one of the core portions of this project.

Re: create and maintain, absolutely, which is why I'm willing to be quick to prioritize some features at the expense of others. But I think we can get a lot done by the end of June! And where possible, we're looking for where we can re-use existing libraries, and even modularize our own work so that others can make use of it and share the burden of maintenance. 

More on all of this coming soon -- I'll be posting some sketches and ideas this week (maybe even today, not sure) which'll help flesh out some of these ideas, and surely spark more discussion.

Thanks again!
