Any thoughts on using a smaller pump? If you're only trying to draw 0.3 SLPM, there are a couple of pumps (see the attached datasheet and catalog) used for a similar application that may be able to draw enough air through the draeger tube. There are probably more out there like these as well. 

I'm unsure of the cost of these, but I can request a quote and find out. If they perform as well as the larger aquarium pumps, it may be good for reducing the overall footprint of the device (the smallest for air is the SP 200 EC-LC, at 33 x 25 x 16 mm) and significantly reducing shipping costs. A handheld formaldehyde monitor would be really cool.
