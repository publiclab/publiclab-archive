Hi I triggered the rx100 mII that comes with WiFi and the play memories app from Sony in my android smartphone. It's pretty straightforward, one just has to pair the camera to the phone and that's it. But it only gives you very basic functionality... The idea is to use the balloon not too high so I can use the WiFi and this app. I am gonna make a test to see what the coverage range is for the WiFi in the camera and that's going to be the maximum altitude
