Hi [@shubhangi_student_eee20](/profile/shubhangi_student_eee20), I love how detailed your proposal is. I also love how you've broken down your tasks into smaller pieces. I have a question about the design for smaller screens. In the diagram, you added two menu buttons. Do you think it'll be confusing to users if they have two identical menu buttons on the page? 

Also, while preparing these mockups, did you consider accessibility? We want Infragram to be accessible to everyone.

Thank you!!
