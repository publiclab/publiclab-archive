Ok guys,I'm used to commercial instruments.  So these scans always throw me.  First, if you are trying to compare concentration in the commercial world, this is almost always done in the absorbance mode, not the linear mode (these scans show linear scales).   This is because of Beers Lambert s law (sounds better than it is) that says concentration is usually proportional to absorbance.
   And almost always  background scans are run to take out the effects of routine environmental differences.  Would this take too much extra software?
  Calibration used to be done with holmium oxide glass.  That is probably hard to get a hold of in the correct thickness.  At least for a decent price.

Sorry for the dumb questions.
