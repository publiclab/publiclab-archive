Stitching Mobius photos can be hard. The longer lens will help. Correcting the distortion afterwards can help. A high shutter speed and vibration damping can help. I assume you can also program the DJI to stop and hover for each photo. If so it would be a mistake not to do that.

I have not seen any good NDVI results from a Mobius with a blue filter. I found a [red filter gave much better results](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-26-2014/mobius-ndvi). But I have not done much infrared work with the Mobius.

The red filter from Public Lab is Rosco [#19](/n/19) which is superficially similar to the Wratten 25.  
The blue filter from Public Lab is Rosco [#2007](/n/2007) which is superficially similar to the Wratten 47 or Schott BG3.  
The Wratten 15 is yellow-orange.
