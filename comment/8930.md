Jeff, I am sure it can be done. However, coding is not my strong suit :( I may help on theory and algorithm development though...

Cfastie, you are right. We need to have a 100% olive oil and some expert to say it is 100%. And a nice database of different olive oil brands. It is more common to dilute high quality olive oil with low quality olive oil rather than peanut oil, I guess.
