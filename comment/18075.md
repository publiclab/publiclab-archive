Here is a device ( https://www.consumerphysics.com/business/ )we have considered using as it offers a self contained hand held unit suitable for consumers and businesses alike.  Acquistion of the necessary Phytonutrient data points is the initial issue to properly calibrate the unit in question as well as its support IOS interface.
