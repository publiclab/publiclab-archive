Great, thanks!

I spoke with Jeff today (today was the day that I went down to Somerville to meet face-to-face) and we concluded that given the annotations needs I detailed above and the performance profile of canvas vs. svg, it makes more sense to use svg.  I'm going to take a look at the Leaflet.draw plugin to see if I can take it as a starting point.  Since svg has a natural notion of state, there's less of a need for a high-level abstraction library, as there was with canvas, so I will most likely build the annotation tool using plain svg.

I didn't realize that pre-trip planning was something that people were hoping to use MapKnitter for - that's really useful info - thanks for passing it along!
