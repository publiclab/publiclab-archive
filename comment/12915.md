All the visualization software is custom stuff we developed at the CREATE Lab.  The grapher in the demos is our BodyTrack grapher which we've now mostly replaced with a new version that supports WebGL (with a fallback to Canvas for browsers which don't support WebGL).  The grid is a one-off, written just for that particular visualization.

Probably the best place to start learning about the grapher is with our wrapper library: https://github.com/BodyTrack/plot-manager
