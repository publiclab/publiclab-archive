Questions: 

What is your input and can you show the input data as well (mainly the red and near infrared images)?

What software did you use to convert the images to NDVI? (cite code snippets if not the photo monitoring plugin in imagej / fiji)

Without this information it is hard to help you figure out what is going on.

Cheers,
