Chris - Here are some comments to your first round of questions:

###How does this apply to dual camera systems, or does it apply only to single camera (Infragram) systems? (I think both)###
This type of calibration should work for single unmodified (visible) and modified NIR cameras as well as dual NIR/visible cameras. The goal of calibration is to convert the pixel values in each band of a photo to a physical measurement - reflectance.

###Is this approach objective as opposed to subjective? (I think yes) What makes our current approach subjective, and what makes this approach objective? (I couldn't articulate an answer)###
Yes - this is objective instead of subjective. The current approach is to play with histogram stretches and white balance until we get an image that looks reasonable. That's fine but the results will depend on the person doing the processing. By calibrating the image bands to physical units we don't have to rely on our perception of what looks good.

###In what ways will this make the NDVI results better than our current results? (precision, accuracy, believability, comparability, interpretability)###
Assuming the calibrated images are reasonably accurate I think the primary benefit will be consistency between different cameras and missions. I should also make it easier for most people to create reasonable NDVI images since most folks don't seem to have much experience working with NDVI. I expect someone like you would be able to create output similar in quality to what you would get using a calibration routine. Another advantage for me is that I simply like working with data that can be associated with physical values.
