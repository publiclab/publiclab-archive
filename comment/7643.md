Hi Hagit,

I enjoyed viewing your video and reading this note. I haven't put much thought into a generic work flow. From my limited experience the goals and constraints around each project are different enough that people tend to craft a custom work flow using different tools and techniques for a particular project. There are quite a few guides and case studies related to community mapping but I don't recall seeing anything that's as creative as what you are thinking about. 

I have a possible social/community mapping project on the horizon so I've been trying to catch up on recent progress in that area. The objective of the project would be to use maps and other spatial resources to improve the way we incorporate human/cultural input into the conservation planning process. I'm not sure of the best way to foster a discussion about this but I'm interested in hearing more about your and other peoples' ideas. I have reasonable experience with the technical/mechanical aspects but am not all that strong when it comes to the creative bits.
