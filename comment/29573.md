Thanks for all your answers and help. 
But solving all kind of plastics or swapping them with iron (III) chloride and having a high chance of false negative results is not ideal ;-)

I thought there is maybe an easy way with a self made spectroscope or a ready to use Arduino sensor.

Of course it doesn't need to be 100 % perfect but it should give results with a confidence of let's say 80 % whether there is BPA in that toy or not.
