Has there been any movement on the rumored Infragram App for Raspberry Pi?  See my recent update about the TSL2561 Digital Luminosity Sensor for something that might make a good addition to such a project.  The TSL2561 is compatible with the Raspberry Pi via i2c which means it should only take a simple Python script to combine the sensor readings with the PiNOIR Images.  Also, because its 3.3v and compatible with the Raspberry Pi GPIO inputs, neither the camera or sensor would require the USB ports.  Thus freeing its use for something else.  My biggest issue right now is making any sense of the sensor readings.  Perhaps someone with a little more knowledge of things like PAR and Lux could figure it out?
