thanks for the answer Warren, I have one more question. I was going through the Spectral Workbench website. I noticed that you can extract cvs file of the plots. now I am thinking of letting Spectral Workbench do the image processing and then take the cvs file and feed it to my arduino for the comparison/data analysis. I was wondering if you have any experience with this? or do you know anybody who has attempted to establish a communication between online Spectral Workbench and arduino (so that Spectral Workbench spits out the cvs data automatically to the arduino)?
