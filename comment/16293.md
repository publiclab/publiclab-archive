I can help with probe material:
Regarding Stainless Steel, general purpose grade is 304 and marine grade is 316. Stainless steel, particularly 304 grade, will "tea stain" however this surface corrosion can be rubbed off.
304 grade stainless steel most common in hardware stores. I'm not sure of conductivity variation between the two grades [304 and 316]. I'd recommend 316 grade as a standard, for probes, especially for salt water/coastal conditions.
Other option is zinc plated screws but there may be variations in quality of the base metal, which is usually mild steel, and often poor quality these days judging by the way my screw driver tears them up. Also the zinc plating disguises the base metal so you may have bronze base metal without knowing.
