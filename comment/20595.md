I will most likely not be able to participate. I have been concerned and involved with frac sand air quality issues for years. Regarding the topic above for low cost air quality monitors: There have been numerous attempts to monitor air quality around frac sand mines including the work of Crispin Pierce, the Minnesota PCA, a group from the University of Iowa, Concerned Citizens of Chippewa Falls, and Public Lab ( see: https://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/04-28-2017/practicing-a-pm-hotspot-survey-in-new-auburn-wi ). Regardless of what one thinks of the quality of any of these efforts, none  have shown any potential air quality problem. Why would one think more monitoring would show something different?  In particular, how would new monitoring be different? Please be specific. Thanks.
