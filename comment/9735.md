liz - doesn't look like I'll be able to put anything together for you guys tomorrow (among other things, I had forgotten that the main editing page is still running OpenLayers, not Leaflet).  Hopefully I'll have something basic up soon, though, so folks can start beta-testing!

jeff - Not sure about using existing data models.  Annotations that have already been created *will* be preserved - either by porting them to L.Illustrate, or by maintaining them as markers + popups (the current status quo).
