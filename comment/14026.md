Hi jeff, 

Thanks for your ideas and questions, it guides me to study deeper about these gems. For the test cases we have to write test cases for the codes that are written by us. And for the external service, there is built in gem in sunspot called [sunspot-rails-tester](https://github.com/justinko/sunspot-rails-tester).

But, yes for the new users and and for the production environment we have doubts. Then I realise the risk thst we have to face. So I search for other gems with no external dependancies. Then I again stop at ransack gem. It uses meta search, so no external dependancy. Then no production or testing issues. we can write our code ourselves with support of the gem top of active records. And its better for sorting than sanspot.

what do think about this suggestion ? 

Thanks.
