There are some automated microbial systems.  They  do pretty much all the work.  They incubate the samples.   And instead of colony counting, they measure color, usually two or three different varieties.  From that the colony equivalent can be calculated. The systems are quite expensive, and not exactly what you would want.  But parts of the system would help.  Sample handling and using colors to calculate colonies is going down the right path, although it isn't exactly on target. What is usually a light yellow ( for the agar) and the colonies are often white.  The color of the soil is brown and the roots are usually white for the root tracking system.  The root tracking system optics should be easier ( cross your fingers). And the handling of the rest of the system should also be easier ( hopefully, no sterility requirements).  It's been two or three years, but let me see if the model number is in my notes.
