Yes, those linear diode array spectrometers were exactly what I had in mind. Unfortunately I am not so good at electronics and programming but that seems to be the way to much more precise readings without depending on coloured sensors. And it needs a 1000 lines/mm grating which shouldn't be too hard to get. I looked at those setups and there is only one thing that could improve them: if you could have a slightly circular bent diode array, so that all the rays have exactly the same way from grating to sensor. In one plan they used a bent mirror but then there is the same problem on the other side of the mirror - to get a circular wavefront become a linear one. But all in all it is very interesting to think about these things and the maths behind them. Thanx for the links!
