Hi Chris,

to obtain this picture you stretched the histogram of the visible or visible and IR.
As far as I understand to make NDVI picture a visible light picture is required, isn't it? or is it possible to create NDVI with NIR photo alone?
I need to work on the calibration as you suggest. I'll post the result as soon as they are ready.
