I have not seen a cheap filter like Rosco that is truly a narrow band pass filter. It might be possible to combine filters to get a fairly narrow transmission band. The total transmission would be low, but it might be acceptable for certain applications. Rosco.com has transmission graphs for most of their filters. 

For example, these two Rosco filters together (and in combination with the camera's IR block filter) would transmit mostly red light between 600 and 700 nm:

But the wavelength band would not be all that different from what the red Bayer filter does.

Combinations of other filters might do a better job substituting for narrow band pass filters. 

The best option might be red filters manufactured for laser barcode scanners. They work at a narrow wavelength band between 630 and 670 nm. So glass filters are mass produced for narrow bands around these targets. Here is one example:

I tried to buy a few of these on Alibaba, and actually submitted a request for quotes, but the barely decipherable responses from a handful of salespeople representing Asian companies were more entertaining than helpful. I would have had more luck had I been interested in buying 1000 filters. Another problem is that barcode scanners use very small squares of the filter, so big pieces are rare. But those red filters are a commodity, so it should not be hard to find a few larger pieces.
