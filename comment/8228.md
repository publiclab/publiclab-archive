I've been trying to find stand-alone diodes, and it seems that there are several chinese manufacturers of [405nm laser diodes on Alibaba](http://www.alibaba.com/trade/search?fsb=y&IndexArea=product_en&CatId=&SearchText=405nm+laser+diode) that are quite affordable ($0.50-2) range.  so some sort of solid state calibration + emission spectroscopy setup seems possible with a very basic diode circuit board.
