[@ccpandhare](/profile/ccpandhare) [@tech4gt](/profile/tech4gt) exciting!

[@jbreen](/profile/jbreen) - you'd know this... are there any tiles available for LANDSAT's near-infrared bands? Especially like NGB type tiles where infrared is in the red channel and visible in the blue? I always ask you these kinds of questions like you're a GIS Gandalf, but it's because you always know!!!
