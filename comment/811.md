I think Dorn was planning on measuring biomass sometime during the next week.  He will harvest all plants in two 1m2 plots in each of the 52 plots.  You could do the same thing digitally, with more sample plots, so there is no reason to rectify the whole image to remove the random horizontal distortion. However, the same variables responsible for the horizontal distortion could also distort the surface vertically.  Without calibration it would be hard to defend your result.

Here is a snapshot of the highest resolution model I have produced so far in MeshLab.  This is from a portion of the model that used the lower elevation photos (some parts of the model did not). It does not have the jpeg texture mapped on it (because I don't know how), but that is irrelevant to volume calculations.

There is lots of noise in this model (the troughs are four foot wide mowed paths that were pretty flat and level), so determining a base plane from which to measure volume in the plots between the paths will be tricky.
