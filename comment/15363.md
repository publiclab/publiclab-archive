[@warren](/profile/warren), et. al. Seems my point was missed; this is not a trivial point and it isn't just a matter of scientific notation where measurements are concerned. If 2.0 is given w/o the uncertainty, but the uncertainty were +/- 0.8, then 2.0 would imply greater accuracy than is warranted; so '2' is more appropriate when no uncertainty is specified. 2.0 (w/o the uncertainty) implies <0.05 uncertainty because 2.0 is specified and not 2.1 or 1.9. Claiming a calculation result of 2.034685 when using measurements from a 12-inch ruler is misleading because measurement uncertainty is, at best, about +- 0.02. So, '2.03 +/- 0.05' would be a more accurate representation and, depending on the calculation, even that could misrepresent the result's accuracy.
