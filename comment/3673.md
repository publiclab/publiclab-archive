Wow, it sounds like you are operating right on the edge of the system's capabilities.  That problem is related to streaming video, and for the IRcam you need only transfer a single frame from each camera. But I guess the problem is that with little or no RAM for buffering, the cameras must transfer the photo as soon as it is captured. And for synchronous photos, that means two full frames trying to get through one USB controller at the same time and maxing out the limit. Is one option an additional USB controller, or would that be more trouble and expense than just using two Pis? An upgrade to the cameras might help if the new ones had more RAM or MJPEG compression, but that would probably cost more than a second Pi.

Maybe the land-based Plant Cam can have asychronous capture and a more expensive option is needed for aerial work.
