I love this. I think white glue (EVA, like Elmers) is probably plenty good for this purpose, and most people will have some. But [@abdul](/profile/abdul), I wonder if including a small bottle of white glue is not unreasonable; even on amazon they're ~$1, and in bulk i bet we could find them for much less:
