This looks awesome. I'm also ordering a Raspberry Pi Zero + camera to test out with a spectrometer, but curious how standardized/simple Raspberry Pi cameras have become for basic interval shooting? Is there a way to get one with all standard parts and an on/off switch and battery, all in a nice box?
