I'm not sure what a Fiji lut file is. Might be binary. I got the values into a tab delimited text file. 

<a href="https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/146/original/NDVI_VGYRM-lut.txt"><i class="icon icon-file"></i> NDVI_VGYRM-lut.txt</a>

And I was able to circumvent the dastardly security measures to attach it here. 

I guess it might be easy for certain people to make this usable at infragram.org. I wouldn't know.

But this is a very new lut and I am just starting to put it to use and evaluate it. So I will post a note about it and see if people have opinions.
