Great image [@nearsys](/profile/nearsys)! I wonder if anyone else (perhaps [@sophied](/profile/sophied) and [@sashae](/profile/sashae) ?) might have any insight on the question you asked: 
>Has anyone looked into adding an amplifier to the turnstile antenna prior to the SDR? Could that improve image quality in the extreme north and south of the images?
