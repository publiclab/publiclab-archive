Hi, Benjamin! Thanks for all of this! Perhaps we should move it over to https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1502 where that graph is posted, or to https://publiclab.org/questions/bsugar/01-25-2018/how-was-the-tag-graph-visualization-made -- it's really helpful; i just don't want to get off the topic here which is actually not about coding but about editorially organizing some of these topic names. Thanks a lot, and great to hear from you!
