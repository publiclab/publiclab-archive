Thanks for your observations and feedback!

This my first project of this sort (like planning what I am going to code in the next X weeks, being X greater than 2), so I'm a bit nervous about being able to complete the tasks by the estimated time. 
In this regard, what do you think of the timeline? Is it realistic? 
Is there anything that could be improved to make it more realistic?

About your second question, I'm really excited about the Cytoscape improvements! Complex networks always arouse my curiosity and I think there is a lot of room for creativity and collaboration in that feature. I also think it will be challenging, that's why I put it towards the end, so I will have time to study the documentation and get familiar with the tool.
