Warren,

  What a putz I am.
  When I set up our Trailcam, I just kinda followed the the set-up feature intuitively because I lost the manual (actually, it was discarded as unwanted trash by my wife).
  Therefore, I'd be almost NO help to you in programming a time-lapse mode feature, if one exists on our camera. 
  I programmed it to simply take TWO PHOTOS per day...one at 10:00 am and one at 4:00 pm. It has the capability (obviously) to take pics hourly, but Sargent Sand's dredge mining has ceased since their "lake" froze in mid-December and they're doing no active surface mining these days...they are simply moving and removing/loading to trucks their Fall stockpiles. ( I've moved it to a different location for that reason...no sense in taking pics of a frozen lake, I guess!)

  I'll attempt to attach a photo or two of how we set up our Cam as inconspicuously as was deemed possible (and productive enough) along the perimeter of their property line. It isn't "pretty", but it works.
