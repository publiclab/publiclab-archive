Ned, The NDVI image made from the Rosco 2008 photo by stretching the histograms is surprisingly similar to your calibrated NDVI image from the red filter photo. The two images have just about the same amount of information about plant vs non-plant. This is good news for all the people starting to use a Rosco blue filter, because it is a lot easier to stretch the histograms than to include a calibration target in your photos and then compute regression equations. What is the main message to people making decisions about what filter material and workflow to use? What do you really gain by using a red filter? What are the real advantages of making calibrated NDVI images? Is it possible for a typical user to reduce the considerable obstacles to making calibrated NDVI images?
