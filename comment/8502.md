Initially I want to create the ImageOverlay subclass and the distortion code separately from the interactive code along with the interactive event handlers. This will help other contributors to modify the code more easily in the Beta-phase. When we take it out of the testing phase then I will modify the code to respond to events from the event handlers as a part of Mapknitter's JS code.

I had a look at Vidun's proposal and I think that our work is extremely complementing. The only doubt I have is with the timelines as Vidun plans to complete most of the overlapping features much before I plan to build the relevant plugin. I have made a simpler version of the plugin (https://github.com/anishshah101/ImageDistortLeaflet) which allows affine transformations using 3 corners of an image and it can be used as a reference for building the features Vidun wants. I will discuss this with him once. If this works out then we will be able to port the interface to Leaflet very quickly.

The features of transparency and outlining are already present in Leaflet. Locking will be easy to build.
