[@warren](/profile/warren) I have the .stl files in the description, you can upload those to Shapeways. 
In PLA on shapeways the absorption cell body costs $26; the Spectrometer Body runs $15 and the Camera Mount $9.47 for a total project cost of $50.91. 

I can't seem to find where to make a link to the object, but they all seem to load correctly and to size (scaling should be in inches when you upload). 

As for time, once I got the printed parts it took maybe 20-30 minutes to assemble, most of which was getting the grating installed and then aligning the camera and then once I was satisfied taking the super glue to attach the camera mount to the spectrometer body.

Thanks again [@stef](/profile/stef) for playing with my design!  If anyone is interested I also took the paper cut version and made a silhouette cut file to make one out of cardstock...
