[@shanlter](/profile/shanlter), this is great! Have you seen the spreadsheet on the www.publiclab.org/wiki/water-sensors page? There are some other options there listed for each of these parameters, though I don't know what their availability is in China. Did the Chinese government state the methods they would use to evaluate each of these parameters? Also, did they say anything about the strategies they are using to clean up the water? Will there be stricter effluent or discharge rules? I really, really hope they can improve the water quality in rivers like they plan!
