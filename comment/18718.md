[@ccpandhare](/profile/ccpandhare) thanks a ton for your input, i really appreciate it and honestly i built this proposal keeping yours from last year as my guide.
I will definitely start researching and planning for the GPU issue and allocate proper time for it in the timeline.
One other thing i wanted to ask you and [@warren](/profile/warren) was that while i was reading proposals from last year someone mentioned building the web ui with vue.js will that be a good idea, that way we can make a super responsive UI and build it in a way that both web and mobile would be able to take advantage of the offline feature, service workers(which process on alternate thread) and better,more informative ui, what do you guys think?
