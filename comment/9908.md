[@Ned](/profile/Ned), thanks for the pointer on the error and the device you testing on. If your GPS is still on, then the app should still work, even without phone access, only thing in this case is that the photos will not be emailed, just stored on your SD card. (tested this flight mode on, and GPS on).
Unfortunately, the best way to successfully debug the error will need to have an Android editor, so will try get a Samsung Tab 2.0 at a tech hub here at home, and see where the app crashes..
I think I should have the User Guide as a research note too? At least so that it's available even when not in the app (because the path: "Homepage >> 'Guide' menu >> Sky cam guide" is in the app)..

[@Jeff](/profile/Jeff), much appreciated feedback! Will be looking into the issues today, and will have a new .apk for testing tonight. Was a little bit hesitant to merging my source code branch with the master branch at https://github.com/publiclab/sky-camera before but now that the .apk is well on, I will merge my branch with the master at publabs after every successful code test.
