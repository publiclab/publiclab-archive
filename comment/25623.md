If anyone is interested I have completely re-written the micro-service that notifies you while  a sensor PM2.5 reading crosses a threshold.

With start / stop commands, 3rd party data source for temperature and humidity, data format check (PurpleAir recently introduced a string of changes). And more clear messages. 

Contact me if you believe itâ€™s worth sharing.
