Oh, one more thing - if you tag each of your posts with "response:10139" as I just did, it'll always link back to your original GSoC proposal, which'll help keep things organized. 

Finally, can you post a link to this research note to the plots-gsoc list so the other students are encouraged to follow your example and post updates this way? Thanks :-)
