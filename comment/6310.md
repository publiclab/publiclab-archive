'How much water depth (or column depth) is typically analysed when looking for the chlorophyll-A using absorbance ? Is it in the order of centimetres or metres ?' 
This really depends on the specific water body. During heavy blooms, the first optical depth can be as low as centimeters. Usually we have sth. on the order of meters in the blue/green. We calculate absorption, not absorbance. 

'Would a calibrated filter work to narrow down the problem of the source calibration ?'
Hm, no i think the wavelength calibration with fluorescent light gives us really narrow peaks already. We would rather need a source with a stable intensity profile, or at least stable ratios. It's tricky, calibration lamps are far from being affordable. I guess the task is to find a cheap compromise. 

'Are you looking at a specific wavelength for the absorbance or a range ? I'm guessing you are looking at absorbance at some other colour than green.' 
Yes, ratio algorithms are the usual approach. [This](http://www.oceanopticsbook.info/view/optical_constituents_of_the_ocean/_phytoplankton) is a good introduction. However, there are also some algorithms that use the full spectral information, e.g. some neural network approaches. Blue/green ratios are working well in open ocean waters, where all other optically active components are driven by the phytoplankton biomass. In coastal areas and inland waters, the situation is more complex and more sophisticated spectral-unmixing algorithms have to be applied. 

'Forgive the questions, but water quality monitoring around these parts is rather important, the school I teach in runs a small aquaculture set up and getting a handle on the build up of algae would be excellent. I would also be interested in seeing if it could be tied in to pre-emptive chlorination of swimming pools, picking the (exponential ?) rise in algae as an indicator it is time to chlorinate, rather than rely on the measured value of the chlorine which is wasteful.'
Cool idea! The issue with swimming pools is that you usually get a significant amount of bottom reflectance into your measurement. This makes the whole radiative transfer much more complex, as many of the assumptions for analytical solutions are not valid anymore and you need to know your pool's bottom albedo. It'd rather measure samples in that case. 

[@webbhm](/profile/webbhm):
lab analysis of water samples is still considered the most accurate measurement (even though, there are many uncertainties involved as well). usually chlorophyll-a concentration is determined with absorption measurements of filter-pads. fluorometry I mostly heard of in combination with 'living' samples/cells. [this](http://photosynq.org/how-it-works/) project uses in-vivo fluorescence, measured with open source components.
