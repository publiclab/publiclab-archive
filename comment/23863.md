So I was reading about minimum exposure time of the Pi cameras and learned that it uses something called a "rolling shutter", which means it reads each line in the sensor individually in sequence. This can cause "banding" with light sources that flicker, where some lines in the sensor register more light than other lines. I don' t yet know if this can be a major issue for calibration, but I have seen what may be banding effects in some of the spectral workbench uploads by others, so I wonder if this would be an issue.

To get around the banding problem, either we need to find a way to hack the camera to have a global shutter mode, or maybe just take a few photos of the same spectra and average the result. This would be especially important at short integration times, and the averaging might also help to reduce noise associated with short exposure time.
