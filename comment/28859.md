People can directly testify about odors, providing 1) narrative accounts of impact to health, to family and social interactions, and to the use and enjoyment of property, and 2) because "smells can't be photographed," photos of related phenomena such as flypaper traps: https://thefern.org/2019/12/rural-north-carolinians-won-multimillion-dollar-judgments-against-the-worlds-largest-hog-producer-will-those-cases-now-be-overturned/. 
Decades of environmental justice struggles in North Carolina provide leadership on this issue. Give a look at the overview here in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, which is funded by the federal government, and has covered many odor and EJ issues: https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.121-a182. This article covers work by [beloved EJ advocate Steve Wing ](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP1406) who testified in court as a scientist many times about his research findings on human health. This article also points out gaps in the domain of agencies regulating [#cafo](/tag/cafo) and the agencies regulating human health which allow injustice to flourish unchecked, requiring people to litigate.
