I want to update this post to say that since I posted this question, Esri has developed an all-in-one app called, ArcGIS Field Map. 

It seems to be robust and fits our criteria. I shied away from using ArcGIS because it was prohibitively costly 10-15 years ago. Now, a subscription costs $100/year for individual use and the interface is much more user-friendly. 

Shout out to [@seankmcginnis](/profile/seankmcginnis) for sharing his vast knowledge of Esri and mapping applications.
