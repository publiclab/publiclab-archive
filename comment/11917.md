Hi there
The last post is over a year old so I don't know if there is anyone around to comment

I am new to the IR NDVI scene and along many of the works I have read one of the pictures in this post grabbed my attention, it's the one that starts this post, here the '94 Miata ( the vehicle ) comes out green like if it were a healthy plant.

This grabs my attention because over at a http://agribotic.com they have this article in their blogs where they also show a tractor in green and they know it should not have this color ( Below is the link ) 

The post can be summarized in regards to the color of the filter to use as

<s>As a practical matter, this translates into Agribotix using a blue notch filter in our cameras and the green channel to serve as the visible signal in vegetation index calculations.</s>

They also use a different formula to get to the best NDIV possibel

<s>DVI is better than DNVI</s>

This is the link
