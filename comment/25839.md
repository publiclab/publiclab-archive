Unfortunatly the lense in the removable piece was only one piece as far as I can tell. It did not have the separate piece like I see on many of the web pages. So, it was either built into the lens somehow, or attached to the CCD. Not sure which. 
I don't have a great picture here.
I tried poking and prodding on the lens even to the point that it is no longer good. There was no sign of anything to be removed or separate from the main lens. 
At this point this camera is no good, but I would still be interested to know because I could buy another (they are the cheapest cameras), but I think there is no way to remove the IR filtering...
