Hi [@warren](/profile/warren), I had never did put the board files online before (Sorry).  I just made them available at https://github.com/SmokyMountainScientific/WheeStat5Eagles.  Anyone wanting to make one of the 5 series boards themselves from the pcb can buy them in sets of 3 at this url: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/yepeXPFo.   
You will notice that I have a research note describing new hardware. If you contact me, I can sell you the pcb for the new hardware version.  Alternatively, you can get them here: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/ESaBVpCE.  You can get the Eagle files for the next generation board here:https://github.com/SmokyMountainScientific/WheeStatE_7Eagles.
Best, Jack
