After reading your proposal, I had the following questions.

Will you have a job, besides GSOC, this summer?

Proposal Questions:

-a- Which GitHub repo is "PublicLab's web site" in your proposal?

-b- Are you stopping with Rails 5.0 or 5.1? You mention both.

-c- Why stop with Ruby 2.2.2?

-d- How will you tell when you have enough tests?
