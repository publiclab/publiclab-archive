Nicely done. I did actually throw together some code that does exactly what you just did a while ago...but then got buried in work and adventures and havn't got around to writing a note about it. 
it's [here](https://github.com/kinasmith/publicLab/tree/master/Riffle/Simple_Temp_Logger_LowPwr). But what you've got looks like it works great. Interesting pattern in your temp graph there, also nice to see the battery voltage didn't change. 
As far as dealing with the UnixTime Stamps, I've been using R to do my graphs and stuff. I have a pretty remedial knowledge of it, but if you know matlab it might make more sense to you. You can also do conversions in Excel, [as demonstrated here](https://www.berezniker.com/content/pages/office/excel-convert-unix-time-excel-time). 
Github is fine for smaller bits of data like these...

Sorry about the mess in my code. I think I was debugging something and forgot to put it back to normal than pushed my changes without realising it. Nice job getting it working.
