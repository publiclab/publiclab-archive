Hi [@btbonval](/profile/btbonval)! Thanks for your comment and concern. We have thought a lot about these issues. We are planning to do some randomized monitoring+surveying to compare to (and asses bias) and we will also have stipended community members facilitating online exchange so we are not so worried about things getting too out of hand. I just sent your comment to Nicole, the epidemiologist on the team, who can provide a longer and more precise response. We won't be able to control for all bias, but we are working to make the data as robust as possible without compromising our grassroots ethos. Also, and i keep having to remind myself of this, the data is just half the story.
