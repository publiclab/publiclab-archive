I am excited about this new camera.  I recently purchased a DJI Phantom 2 with the intent of using it along with a modified Canon A2200 to shoot aerial NDVI imagery.  With the copter already loaded with GoPro, FPV, Ground Station, and iosd it has all it can handle.  I added the A2200 to the copter but it was extremely unstable and I am afraid to fly it overloaded.  With this light weight camera I can remove the FPV and still be within weight limits.  My question, since a different filter is now being used, are there plugins available for Fiji to process the new type of data?
