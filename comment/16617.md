Yes it would seem that you could do it with an atmega 328 one of the timers supports the use of a clock crystal which will get your timing accurate and if I am reading the data sheet correctly you can indeed store data in the unused flash memory. It does however seem like overkill to use a 28 pin device with huge amounts of memory. 
I case anybody is wondering about the barometric pressure data the wobbling is not noise it is showing (rather nicely in my opinion) the semidiurnal pressure variation which is rather pronounced close to the equator (where I am located).
