I have one of the first Mobius cameras that Public Lab bought to test. It has the standard lens. I removed the IR cut filter ([note](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-22-2014/mobius-ir-conversion)) and then after using it for testing I installed an IR cut filter that I had removed from a PowerShot. The camera now works for normal photography if I use automatic white balance.
