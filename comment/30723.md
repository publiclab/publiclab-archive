Fixation is the process by which atmospheric nitrogen is extracted and transformed into nitrogen molecules useful for other biological reactions. Plants and animals integrate NO3- and ammonia produced by nitrogen fixation and nitrification through a process called assimilation. The process of recycling nutrients that have been consumed by an organism (plant or animal) to create its body begins with decomposition. 
Ammonification is the process by which bacteria and other tiny, decaying organisms convert the molecules that contain nitrogen from dead organic matter into more basic compounds like ammonia. Reduced nitrogen molecules, usually ammonia, are successively oxidized to produce nitrite and nitrate during the microbial process of nitrification. 
The process of denitrification removes bioavailable nitrogen from the environment by converting nitrate to nitrogen gas.
