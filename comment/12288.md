The panel order is not important as long as it's predictable and known. The "ideal" targets would probably be a few gray patches from bright to dark and it would be nice if the refelctance of each target was roughly similar through the visible and NIR. Some other qualities are that the samples should have diffuse (as opposed to specular) reflectance properties and as you noted the reflectance properties should be reasonably stable so they don't change over time. Weatherproof and protected would be useful for working in the field. When sampling form the calibration patches you'd make sure you sampling pixels away form the patch edges. I'm sure there are other qualities/features that other folks can add to but this is a start.
