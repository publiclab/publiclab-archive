Wow!

If you can implement this using WebGL on Canvas, I think you will see a huge performance increase on light weight systems such as netbooks and mobile devices, which actually make good use of WebGL as opposed to Javascript running on the CPU.

In an email, you mentioned that you found alternative sources that helped you come up with your current implementation. Could you update this note with links and references to the alternative sources you found?
