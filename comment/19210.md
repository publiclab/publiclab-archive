OK - some VERY good points here. Great thinking. Let me address what I can:

1. if the twitter username collides with an existing PL username, we could offer to modify the PL username, or prompt people for a new one (perhaps suggesting `warren1`, `warren2` etc?)
2. if Twitter doesn't offer email, we can prompt for email just after the account is made, OR
3. we could just allow accounts to not have emails and just be sure whenever doing notifications that we **check** for email before sending
