Tom from Thatchmore farm wrote back to me with some of the following details and a request:

> We are planning to install a hydraulic ram pump sometime soon so it would be useful to know the elevation change between the stream at the upper (southeast) corner of the property and the adjacent ridge in the south center part of the property (up on the image at the website.)  Here’s the design we are considering.

> It uses falling water to pump a portion of the water to a higher elevation. All the splashing in the clip is the waste water that starts the cycle again.  Our hope is to fill a reservoir and to gravity irrigate from that source. We can always find the rise by hand using a rod. so don’t spend a lot of time on it.
