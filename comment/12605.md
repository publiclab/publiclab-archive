That's a wonderful interface. I calibrated many times because it was fun to do.

The interface choices you made work really well, but you might be interested to know that I would have taken a different approach:

1. I would have allowed the user to stretch the new spectrum to match the calibrated reference, not the other way around.
2. I would have used the spectral graph trace of the reference instead of the photo of the diffraction pattern. 

But it certainly works well the way it is now.

The Snowy Sky spectrum is very clear, but not as accurately calibrated as a calibration reference should be. It was calibrated with a macro by using the 405 nm and the 650 nm lines, so those are very accurate, but most of the other lines are not. For example, the 436 and 546 nm lines used in your calibration procedure are both more than 5 nm off.  This is the spectrum that I [recalibrated with a third order polynomial using 14 peaks](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/3-6-2013/polynomial). The final calibrated result exists in Excel but could be transferred to Spectral Workbench. Of course that is just the data, not the photo of the diffraction pattern. Somebody with MatLab or something could probably apply the polynomial to the image.

SW 2.0 looks very awesome.
