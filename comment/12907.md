Awesome technique! 
the look of the 5w-30 reminds me of thawed out frozen diesel fuel.  I think the milkiness in diesel from freezing is from wax crystal formation-- If the 5w-30 is heated a bit (just a bit!) I would imagine the waxes could be re-suspended.  There are fuel-line and fuel tank heaters in some diesel vehicles to do this. I suspect that some of the waxy components might be missing from the re-suspended mixture because they are still stuck in the frozen container, but I could be wrong.


in terms of comparison, it looks like there might have been some clipping on the 5w-30 and ConEd spectra:
