I don't know what the "Markdown" thing is. Why does it say that? To get a discount in the store? Anyway, the second comment above was in response to how when I wrote the first comment each "-" was on a new line (as in, I hit "Enter") but it didn't show up like that when I Published the comment.  I guess I should have previewed it first. No problem.
