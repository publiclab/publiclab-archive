Also -- just a thought -- there are a few others testing this out too, so if you could take some contextual photos of how you set it up, what it's pointed at, and even an example photo of what you're hoping to capture (like, a google image search, just so people know what it might look like once you have the photos), that'd be really helpful to compare notes with others (like [@DMerwitz](/profile/DMerwitz) [asking a question about timelapse here](https://publiclab.org/questions/DMerwitz/10-17-2016/trail-camera-on-state-park-land)) on what works well. I think [@marlokeno](/profile/marlokeno) has a friend working on this too. 

I know [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) did some good documentation of that sort here: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/09-20-2016/zero-dark-thirsty-capturing-replenishing-nighttime-rain-events-with-a-trail-camera

Thanks and again, good luck!
