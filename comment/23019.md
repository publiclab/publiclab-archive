I've noticed there are a couple different methods for monitoring turbidity:

- Secchi disks: where users putting a disk into a body of water and measuring the distance in the water until the disk is no longer visible.
- Turbidity tubes: which require a sample of water to be viewed by the naked eye through the tube, and
- Turbidity meters: which requires a sample of water put into a meter that measures the amount of scattered light that sample produces (when with a light is shown through a sample at 90 degrees).

I'm wondering, [under what conditions would I choose between these different methods? Posted that question here.](https://publiclab.org/questions/stevie/03-21-2018/how-do-i-choose-a-method-for-monitoring-turbidity)
