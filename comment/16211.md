The CSV file for the R script is different form the table in the "Improved DIY NIR camera calibration" post. The CSV file has the reflectance value for even wavelengths from 400nm to 2498nm as rows and two runs each for the 6 sample targets. I can send you the file but it would only work if your targets were identical to mine. The best solution for you is to edit the R script to only read the specific reflectance values for your targets that correspond to the center wavelengths for each band pass for your filter. You would store those values in the "refVis" and "refNIR" variables.
