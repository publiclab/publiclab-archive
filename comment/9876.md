Yeah -- as soon as we wanted to include mathjax, we started to think -- oh, gosh, now any author with their own particular tools will want to have them built into the publiclab.org rendering engine ... and right, that can quickly become a mess ....

Part of the idea here is that it'd be neat for authors of complex research notes to be able to consider publicab.org to be a 'publishing platform' akin to traditional science publications, but with all of the modern awesomeness that the open web makes possible: the author writes a document over which they can version control and edit however, and this content is displayed, tagged, curated, on publiclab.org -- it seems like a really wonderful model for 'publishing', going forward.  The trouble with this vision, as you say, is that every author might have their own peculiar formatting requests / needs.

This lead us to the "iframe" approach: using pre-generated HTML, the author is responsible for translating their formatting needs into standard HTML, which publiclab.org can simply display.  Is there a way of following this approach -- embedding HTML from some external site -- that doesn't raise security issues?  

Hmm ... maybe instead of generating HTML, we could use pandoc externally to generate a PDF of the document, and then 'display' this in a scrolling PDF display window in a publiclab.org research note?
