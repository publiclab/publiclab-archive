There may have been confusion in part because some of the winter images GLAM took show trails where inflows melted ice, whether due to the flow of water or the different temperature of the inflow. So in a sense those images may have documented a thermal difference, even just with a regular photograph, [as in this map](/map/gowanus-canal-brooklyn-new-york/2011-01-22):

The lead image is nice -- it's from this note: https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/8-3-2011/ir-reveals-gowanus-plume
