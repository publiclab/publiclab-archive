That post from Tom was the one I was referring to in my idea [#2](/n/2) but yeah, I must have  misread it. 

Still, regarding [#1](/n/1), I do understand that some materials are coated and others are actually naturally absorbative, my question is if anyone knows which the A2200 filter is? As for the difficulty of removing a coating, I'd be willing to try it when my camera arrives provided it's a coated filter.
