Those dissolved oxygen maps are super intriguing. 

Weird spike in oxygen readings just north of Union Street Bridge should be investigated further. Could that be the long lost Bergen Stream outflow ? The Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club, working with NYC Department of Environmental Protection during the 2013 City of Water Day, found that traditionally the stream seepage has LOWER oxygen readings (eg less chance to mix with oxygen underground), so there is some data weirdness here. These oxygen spikes may also be caused by City water main breaks such as those caused by the recent Lightstone Apartment Complex pile driving. 

These are some July 2014 views of what we have tongue in cheek nicknamed "Catskill Spring" - thousands of gallons of tax payer funded clean water pouring into the Canal at 2nd Street. Because of political pressure from local fish, I've been asked to keep this water quality improvement quiet.

I have access to some neighborhood sump pumps were underground streams are visible and accessible. We can get oxygen calibration readings from them to help answer these questions.

Your spatial fluctuations in Canal water quality matches the data from our Citizen Science water quality tests with  the Water Trail Association, (http://www.nycwatertrail.org/water_quality.html) where the outflows on the east Canal side of 2nd Street were shown to lower sewer bacteria counts. The Fresh water inflows from the historic springs would lower salinity readings.

This is area of Canal where your robot data is showing unusual water chemistry fluctuations (2014, 4 September photo, looking torwards the Denton's Spring and Pond outflows)

Looking forward to testing our "Greening the Gowanus" concept with your Yellow Robot. We can use environmentally friendly food colorings to test the patterns of fresh water inflows in the Gowanus Basin.
