CMOS sensors seem to handle IR light differently. There as been some limited [comparison of CMOS and CCD Powershots](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/06-20-2013/ndvi-from-infrablue). One hypothesis is that the color filter array which allows only red, green, or blue light to reach each pixel on a CMOS sensor passes more NIR than the CFA (usually a Bayer filter) on CCD cameras. Or maybe the CMOS sensor is more sensitive to NIR. The effect is strongest with inexpensive webcam like cameras which are all CMOS, After the IR block filter has been removed, the R,G, and B channels all seem to record lots of NIR light. This also happens in CCD cameras but to a lesser degree.

At the bottom of the [page for the Fiji plugin](http://publiclab.org/wiki/photo-monitoring-plugin) there are a couple of look up tables that seem to work well for NDVI.

Your idea for an LED white balance device is great. You are right that using various materials under variable sky conditions is rather unpredictable and indefensible.  We tried to use [LEDs for white balance with good results](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/11-22-2013/white-balance-for-all), but I'm sure if it has been done much. 

Sometimes these [data pictures can look pretty cool](http://infragram.org/i/52edbfa7836488e24a00001b?src=1391312716146_wratten1391312716146_17fr.jpg&mode=raw). But I think the objective of the custom white balance is to fool the camera into emphasizing the NIR channel. When we flood the sensor with red light while doing a custom white balance, the white balance algorithm thinks it needs to make a big adjustment to make the photo look normal. This then forces the camera to make photos which de-emphasize the red channel, and emphasize the blue channel, which records almost pure NIR in a Super-Red camera. It sounds simple, but I have not been able to recreate this adjustment after the photo is taken. Just using Photoshop to make the photo more blue does not do the same thing, and it's hard to make good NDVI images from those photos. I wish someone could explain this to me.
