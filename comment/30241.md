I did this!
Hi! Long time has passed since this original post.
I was doing some in field measurements with this [Cave Pearl Project](https://thecavepearlproject.org/about/about-me/#:~:text=The%20Cave%20Pearl%20Project%20was%20co-founded%20by%20Edward,of%20new%20environmental%20sensors%20that%20anyone%20can%20build) based data logger. I have to give thanks to [@edmallon](/profile/edmallon) and Patricia Beddows for the terrific job with the Cave Pearl Project. For this instance I just measure temperature. This is only one variable related to water quality. I choose to begin with this because it is the most inexpensive sensor. 
I put the data logger in a plastic case for measurements of water temperature in four different sites. This case has to be outside water because it is not waterproof. My next step will be the submerged case. 
I took advantage of a work trip in which I went to sample fish, invertebrates and birds with the [research team](https://www.idea.conicet.unc.edu.ar/grupos/leeaan/#inicio) that I work for to assess water quality. In this kind of trips, we use privative probes and data loggers for field measurements and I want to change it to Open Science Hardware alternatives.

Let’s see what I got in the field.
