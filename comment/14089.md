Hey Jeff, that sounds great, I'm waiting on some disposable UV cuvettes I ordered they should be in monday (I'm tired of cleaning the quartz one's!) If this works like I think it should, then I will go ahead and follow through with the cuvette holder I have been designing on my CAD program, it consists of a solid piece of high density non-compressible black foam.

One is designed for the UV LED and the other for the notch filter (when using a laser.)
