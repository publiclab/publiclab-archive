Hi [Vendy](/profile/Vendy). We have a general page about spectrometry over at [publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry](https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry)-- this would be a good place to find some general information. 

The page we have devoted to the Desktop Spectrometry Kit we sell in our online store is here [desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0](https://publiclab.org/wiki/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0), and it links to lots of information about how to get started with Public Lab kit-- you'll find step-by-step info about setup, activities, links to research notes, how-to's, etc. Even if you're not using our kit it might give you a good sense of how other folks have been exploring spectrometry in their own research. Good luck, and let us know if you have more questions!
