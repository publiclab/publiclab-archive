Hello [@warren](/profile/warren), [@liz](/profile/liz), [@roberts_ecofarm](/profile/roberts_ecofarm), [@read_holman](/profile/read_holman),  [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano), [@oorjit_chowdhary](/profile/oorjit_chowdhary) (and everyone else), thank you very much for your feedback, it's very helpful :) 

There are still 3 main sections: left: topics/tags, middle: blog + activity feed, right: everything else 

I've implemented many changes, mostly: <br>
1. the topics/tags are now more featured, making it easier to organise/read the content (I think all the tags should be listed on the left-hand side) <br>
2. I also added the topics/tags to the activity feed <br>
3. I think the user should be able to remove the items from the activity feed if needed (see the "x") <br>
4. the latest blog is added to the top <br>
5. the notification dashboard (on the right), is meant to display the user's activity - this includes the content the user wrote, starred, or commented on.  <br>
6. the projects are featured on the right-hand side, with the list of the latest projects <br>
7. I removed the duplicate items (like Home) from the sidebar since they will already be in the existing navbar. <br>

The design, as always, is here: https://edieblu.github.io/pl-dashboard/

Let me know if this makes more sense :) 

Eva
