Caleb Hall-3/4/2022-Why 99% of ocean plastic pollution is missing
It is believed that about 99% of plastic pollution in our ocean is "missing". The location of these missing plastics are believed to be hidden in a few locations. Firstly, some scientists believe that about 50% of plastic pollution that makes it to the ocean eventually sinks to the ocean floor and becomes buried in the sediment. Secondly, they believe that most newer plastic doesn't even make it to the ocean. They note that most of it stays near beaches and banks, building up in those areas.
