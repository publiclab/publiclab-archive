The CO2 produced can be measured several ways. Each method has advantages and disadvantages and depends on the final use of the instrument. For example, if using the instrument in a medical device/pharmaceutical field, the vendor should verify the instrument meets the requirements of the "USP/EP/BP"  and so forth.
