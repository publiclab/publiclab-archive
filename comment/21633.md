Great list! Thank you! I would be fully in support of this being our project list. Couple questions: 

* Are we generally expecting that the long-running Geographic Features projects will be at a phase that won't require GSOC attention thanks to the GeoUI work going on now?
* Would it be of interest to work on tag visualization? https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/3064

What do you all think?
