This looks excellent.  

John Wells in Scotland has been working on pendulums for keychain cameras and settled on a coat hanger. A nice feature is that the top end of the coat hanger becomes the perfect thing to wrap the flying line around. He attaches the camera to the wire with Velcro (some adhesive backed Velcro patches and a Velcro strap should be plenty). 

His pendulum is a transverse pendulum in which the lower end of the long shaft holds only a counter weight. The camera is up near the flying line but rigidly connected to the shaft. The counter weight damps swaying, but the camera does not have to experience the entire arc of the swings. A coat hanger would make an effective normal pendulum as well (with the camera at the lower end of the shaft) but I'm not sure the Mobius has enough mass to make a pendulum effective. 

A soda bottle could be fit around the camera if desired, but the small mass of the Mobius does not demand much protection. Just a cage to keep the lens out of the dirt should be plenty. A cage could be formed from the end of the coat hanger. So one continuous wire does everything.  

Total cost could be under $3 including a lanyard. Clothes hangers of 13 gauge wire are [50Â¢ apiece](http://www.ebay.com/itm/50-White-Wire-18-13-Gauge-Sturdy-Shirt-Clothes-Hangers-New-/311462211837?hash=item48849830fd:g:kMsAAOSwA4dWGTG9).
