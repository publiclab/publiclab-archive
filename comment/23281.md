I could be wrong but I do not believe  optical particle counters use spectroscopy as the method is usually described. At any rate a number of years ago when I did some research on the "dust" used in calibration of particulate monitors I often came across references to "arizona dust". Using a search engine should give you the relevant information. Google yields:

Whether it is what purpleair uses is another question.
