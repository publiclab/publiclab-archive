 The sheets of polymer can be made out of many materials, some of which are PVC, LDPE, and HDPE.  On top of this, there are a variety of materials added.  For example, thin sheets of plastic tend to stick together. One common material used to stop this sticking is " erucyl amide", although there are others.  From the list of items detected, it doesn't seem like erucyl amide was the source.  Although it could be other slip agents.
