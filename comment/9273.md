Great report. The mini bottle and 3D printed Picavet will go in the Public Lab record books. And what a fantastic place to fly. Is that public land?

It's too bad about the little camera. I'm glad to hear you were able to retrieve the kite.

I bought one of those line winders too. It came with a $5 discount on another purchase, so I bought a second one. I used it once and have not touched either one since. They could work for ballooning, but are a liability for kiting. You can't beat a halo reel for convenience and effect.

Fifty pound Dacron is a little lightweight. Was it really 50 lb? 150 pound is the minimum line weight for a lot of KAP people.

ActionCams and Pi Cams and other little cameras have advantages, but most of them don't cost less than a $40 ebay or refurbished Powershot which will take photos which are actually useful. Your result at Potts Point confirms that you made a good decision to fly a low end camera, but when the wind is behaving and you have the correct kite, a decent camera might be worth the risk. I decided early on that kite photography was too much trouble unless I could get good quality photos. 

Thanks for the story.
