[@pdhixenbaugh](/profile/pdhixenbaugh), we have experimented with putting cables straight through the cap, and it hasn't been successful.  the plastic (HDPE) of caps is very hard to glue to and can't be sealed with adhesives or sealants, it has to be a mechanical seal with gaskets or rubber washers.

there are ways to do it mechanically involving custom hardware, such as this Blue Robotics cable penetrator ($4):

While that part is both open source AND cheap, its a custom part from a single supplier.  A bunch of those in the lid of a Nalgene bottle would make for a nice and easy-to use system though.
