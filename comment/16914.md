Ed,  

The new Mini Terminal Logger is brilliant. Those Nano terminal shields are a great find. They not only reduce the number of solder joints required but allow beginners to correct wiring mistakes without extra soldering. I ordered some and will try them out. I could never reproduce your elegant builds though. You must be really good at cutting and stripping wire ends to get the wire lengths that precise. Beginners don't need that tight a build, but your result is a great model to emulate. 

I also really appreciate the effort you put into documenting the process of preparing parts and building your various loggers. I know how hard it is to take such information-rich photos. 

Thanks,  
Chris
