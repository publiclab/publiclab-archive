Exciting! We had some really interesting photos of silica sand, and took some cool pictures: https://publiclab.org/n/17785 at AS220 in Providence this weekend. 

We also used 2 lenses from movie theater 3d glasses and were able to get all the crystal particles to appear rainbow-colored -- [#polarized-light-microscopy](/tag/polarized-light-microscopy) -- it worked amazingly well with the light shining directly through the sample!
