This could be a great way to plan where to put your Simple Air sensor! You could build a mini model of the area you'd like to study with something as simple as a series of tissue boxes. These boxes could model the way wind is blocked if you put your Simple Air Sensor between buildings. 

You could play a game where one group sets up the humidifier and fan while the other  group is our of the room and has to guess the location of the humidifier and fan (pollution source and wind direction) based on the data logs showing when the Simple Air Sensors went off.
