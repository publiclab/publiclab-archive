Your description about Creede is fascinating, I never heard about this place, it looks so beautiful!! And I am very impressed on what Willow Creek Reclamation Committee is doing. So many peoples gathered to conduct so many great projects, that is inspiring. 
BTW, maybe you've already know and used, Kyoritsu Lab Japan makes many quick testing kits by chemical methods, http://www.kyoritsu-lab.co.jp/ I use them a lot in the field to test metal stuff, only if you don't need continuous data.
