Hi, Liz - I made a new methods page based on this, for kite making: https://publiclab.org/wiki/kite-making

Since it's a sub-category of [#aerial-photography](/tag/aerial-photography), I deleted a few sections that would end up redundant. Also, I changed a few titles, curious of your thoughts:

<pre>

#### What environmental problems might this apply to

* For example, particulate matter in air, turbidity in water, lead in soil?

#### Limitations

(formerly What limitations does the method have?)

* not weather proof? needs a calibration?

#### What it's based on

(formerly Literature review -- could also be "starting points" or something)

#### Design constraints

(formerly What is the design philosophy)

</pre>

I see that you've made the titles into questions addressed to the author, which I like. 

Do you think transforming them into more typical headings (that are, for example, easier to link to), as I did, closes the door too much for future people to expand on these ideas?
