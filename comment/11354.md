The value of camera calibration depends on what you're doing. If you're just looking for relative differences across an image calibration isn't all that important. If you want to compare images from different dates it becomes more useful but for that you could always use image normalization techniques instead of calibration. Calibration is probably most useful if you want to compare images from different sites. There are normalization techniques you can use for that but having a calibrated camera might be easier. 

As far as the different factors that can distort surface reluctance reading I think some of the biggest ones are a result of use taking ultra-high-resolution images. For example the geometry of blades of grass or leaves in an image will be radically different through out the image and when it takes multiple pixels to cover a leaf that will impact your spectral readings for a single leaf. In general, making sense of ultra-high-resolution imaging can be pretty messy but it's an area of active research with many of the neat advances coming from the computer vision field.

A few thoughts,
