Gotcha. In my testing in 2011 i did some of the test and mailed test kits to those i couldn't meet in person. altho it wasn't statistically significant the results of the self test were lower, probably meaning that they didn't prepare their homes (close windows and door for 24 hours prior to testing) as thoroughly as they did when someone was showing up or they turned it off too early. So i'm not so worried personally with forgetting the test is happening  (leaving it on too long would result in a higher result which didn't appear to be the case), i say "tampering" because our case will be stronger if we can claim it to have an un-mess-with-able sampling time. 

thinking speculatively, could we have a system that you call when you start the test and it calls that number back after the allotted time and then they confirm into a voicemail that the test has been stopped?
