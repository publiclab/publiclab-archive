Hi again [@kanaujiashefali](/profile/kanaujiashefali) , I really like your mockups. I love how you connected all the pages on the main image. The welcome modal looks great too.

On the Q& A I see you changed the design a little but wanted to mention the way we list the questions list is not changeable at the moment. You can leave it as is for now : just a heads up. This quote by Jeff from another review  explains why:
> the Q&A is produced using an iFrame containing this URL: https://publiclab.org/embed/grid/question:infragram and so therefore our ability to change the design or layout of that page is quite limited. The page is generated in this repository: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/ and while we could initiate a change over there, the Q&A feature is also used in other places, like here: https://jywarren.github.io/fisheyegl/example/ and so any changes we propose will have to work on other sites as well. That's OK - we can still, for example, put the iFrame in a popup modal window, or a sidebar, or other options, but it is not completely customizable.

It is okay that you kept your milestones precise but it would be great if you made them clearer e.g week 11 "Ensure each component function properly." I believe this includes fixing any bugs introduced so maybe include it too.
Thanks for posting
