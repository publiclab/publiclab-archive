Hi Pat,  
The Wratten 87 passes only NIR; it's great for the NIR camera in a dual camera rig. The Wratten 25 is the best filter I have used for a single camera NDVI system. It could also be used in a dual camera rig because the blue channel would be mostly NIR, but it might also include some UV and a little red. I think the photos from a Wratten 87 camera are a little crisper than the blue channel from a Wratten 25 camera. But I have not done a careful comparison.
