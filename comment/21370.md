Very beautiful observation!  My hypothesis is that chloroplast density is less in new vegetation, but also reflectance/absorbance/transmittance is affected.  Possibly microscopy could confirm.  Is this similar of other types of vegetation, like low lying shrubs, or deciduous trees in the region?  Fireweed NDVI would make for an interesting observation.
