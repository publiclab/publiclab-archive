It's great to see that you have the Saturn V Rig performing well enough to produce all these excellent 360° panoramas. That's quite an artistic point cloud you created. I'm guessing that since all of those photos were from the same flight, they were all taken from about the same location. Your plan of walking the helikite around to get coverage from lots of viewpoints sounds important. If you are using the original sketch that takes the same number of shots at each tilt angle, you should be getting lots of overlap among the photos from the lower tilt angles. And also lots of nadir photos. The hole in the middle of your point cloud must be at the nadir, so that's a mystery. 

I wonder if the higher tilt angles contribute much to sfm reconstructions. They provide a different angle but the subject is far away and therefore lower resolution. Maybe the ideal mode for sfm would be just two or three tilt angles from about 40° to the nadir so the horizon is never close to being included in any photos. There is probably no reason to take more than a few nadir photos in each cycle. I guess the more the rig moves around the landscape the better.

It's a lot of work to figure out the best way to capture the photos. Thanks for investing all this effort.
