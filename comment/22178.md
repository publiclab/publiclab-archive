 OK no problem. There are some suggestions which I wrote on call for proposal, please add them too

Yeah, we are looking forwards for supportive folks.  Make sure to do 1. at least one PR review each week and 

make some FTO issues in each week to involve new contributors inside your projects. People will love to be part of big projects. It is a great feeling to help others.

Please take out a day from timeline from each month at end of each phase of SoC fellowship to write about what you learnt and did in the period. Earlier it was not compulsory. But let's make it compulsory. By this mentors will be able to access your progress. Don't forget to mention the ftos which you created during this period. Also mention the PR reviews which you did.

We are planning for video calls I'm each month during SoC program. So, it will be great to see you all.

These are small activities which can lead to better and supportive community at PL. All participants all programs are encourage to write these in their proposals.

Thanks and best of luck.
