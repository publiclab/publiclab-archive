I look forward to seeing this work with scaling, but it is coming along very nicely.

I agree that there should be a way to drag the whole image. In order to move the image right now, one would have to move each of the four corners to it's final location. It would be far easier to drag the image itself to the final location, and then adjust the corners.

Since the example site is client-side only and the HTML, JS, CSS are on Github, this could be hosted directly out of Github Pages: https://pages.github.com/

Here is an example of github pages. Code repo: https://github.com/btbonval/3D-US-Data-Map, Github page: http://btbonval.github.io/3D-US-Data-Map/Index.html

The source code for index.html in the repo (https://github.com/anishshah101/ImageDistortLeaflet/blob/master/index.html) does not look like the source code for the index.html that you are hosting (http://128.199.208.55/index.html). Have you commit and pushed all your changes?
