1.  check out the following regarding air monitoring; 

http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/aq-spec/protocols/sensors-field-testing-protocol.pdf?sfvrsn=0. A number of their findings on testing less-expensive sensors, including the Purple Air device are presented here: http://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/evaluations/field. This sensor transmits readings in real time to an online map (https://www.purpleair.com/sensors).

2. Some people have been using window panes to collect dust. Use an old one, clean it up good; collect the dust and take a scraping that can be tested. It can provide some very revealing data to the eye and to the microscope.

3. On this facebook page there are some interesting methods used to collect dust: one involves using a large thick filter with a window fan. Inexpensive method costing about $50.00. There are other ideas.
