"signup through providers" means a first-timer coming to the site and wanting to interact but not yet having an account, and creating an account by clicking `Sign up with Twitter` or `Facebook` in order to create an account. This moment is really important to be low-barrier, so people can create an account as quickly as they can, then post their comment/question (their very first interaction with PL!) and then we can circle back to prompt them to add other information. 

I appreciate what you're saying [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) that it's pretty similar, but the sequencing I think is really important -- make sure people can do what they came to do as early as possible. We can then show an alert saying `if you'd like to link an email address + add a password, it's a good idea` -- but /after/ the initial low-barrier login. 

Does it make sense how we really want people to be able to engage quickly and smoothly? This is a high enough priority that I think we can show people the "reset password" function ONLY if they'd made a password.
