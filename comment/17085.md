[@shanlter](/profile/shanlter) [@rocket](/profile/rocket) Thanks for the suggestion of the power bank. My biggest question, particularly related to the power bank in the link, was the voltage requirement of the KnowFlow.  The DFRobot power unit was a 7.4V 2500mAh, while the item in the link was unknown (maybe 3.7V?).  I also looked at a few power banks for the iPhones and the voltage for those was generally unspecified, but likely 5V.
