Hi, what does your setup look like? Can you upload a photo of how you're arranging the light and the samples? 

I've gotten plenty of light while using a UV laser, but that's definitely a stronger source:

If you're looking for a much more sensitive camera, a number of people have upgraded their spectrometers with a Raspberry Pi camera, which is a relatively simple and affordable upgrade:

As this gets proven out, we're hoping to begin carrying this as a more sensitive variant.
