Hi, forwarded this page to a friend with a printer and got this response:
"Also, the stl file (3d object) loads as a very small structure.  I think the scale is incorrect."
Edmunds is pretty expensive, any cheaper sources? 
I see that he diffraction grating is a few bucks on Amazon. 
I'm thinking 'print' the little bits and mount on a wood board. ?
