Hello,

Some experiments suggested that viewing the spectrum at a slight angle (from perpendicular to the grating) produced a clearer image of the diffraction pattern. Some of those experiments are described here: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/2-5-2013/grating-angle. These experiments involved viewing the diffraction pattern with your eye, not with a camera. I don't know whether it has been determined that it makes any difference when photographing the diffraction pattern. Also, angling the camera relative to the grating might be important for centering the visible spectrum in the camera frame as noted here: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/2-12-2013/grating-angle-dvdr.
