 Love this. I am definitely going to try building this at some point, but don't have the time right now. Perhaps after January term.

I am coming back now to work on this with a couple students. We have purchased the Arduino Nano boards since we are hoping to use these units remotely in the Amazon. We have also purchased the BME280 temp/pres  boards, PMS7003 counters with interface boards and wires, and the real time clock with built in SD card slot. I have also purchased the WiFi units (ESP8266) for a later upgrade. Admittedly, this is all new to me, but it seems the sketch above is for the VOC chip rather than the BME280. Do you happen to have a sketch for the "Poor Man's" version you described above? Also, I don't see any mention of the indicator LED, I have a spot for it in my enclosure, but would love to know what pins to wire to. Thanks for the help!
