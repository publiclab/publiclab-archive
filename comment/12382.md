Yes Ned. This is a great added capability to maintain the georeferencing i work hard for.  :-)

The RAW 16bit Tif dual image use capability seems to be broken now. It keeps telling me the image needs to be RGB. (?)

My Tifs were created in RawTherapee from Canon SX260 CHDK DNGs.

Also getting a Java Exifread error in the console now when trying to create the image lists.  Is there a bug stomp in progress?

Thanks for your great work.
