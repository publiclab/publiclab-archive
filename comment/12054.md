Hi, Chris - I've been plugged into several other projects and really didn't have time to do this properly, and there was some confusion over the webcam model that the Kits team sent me. If we sent this prototype red filtered webcam to you, would you be willing to do a more rigorous test? 

I think you mean "relative" and not "subjective", right? Also, I'd prefer that people do the shifting by changing the color map, rather than changing the values. Or, at least that we choose one or the other, since they both do the same thing, but having two points where it's possible to do it is confusing. 

Reading over Ned's procedure for automating absolute calibration, we should be able to add that quite easily to Infragram.org as well -- potentially even with the auto-recognition of a QR code. Exciting, if we ever have time to put some work into the Infragram.org codebase!
