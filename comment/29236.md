Looking through NRC through Jan 1 2000, I have found 632 cars, from 125 incidents, that are likely candidates.  I have found 514 cars from 71 incidents that are certainly incidents to look for.  

I will ask Skytruth to help us create a map and index the NRC Commons info, if they have the time. 

The second question remains, where are these incidents happening, and where in relation to the relative amount of track.
