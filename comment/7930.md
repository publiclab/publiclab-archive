A teaser of the footage is here, we're still working on getting the video together.

I think we'll release mid-January, in conjunction with a global flaring map we are producing. The launch and footage we got was fun, but the biggest value was groundtruthing daily satellite detections so we can sort out flaring activity from a big bonfire in your backyard. I'll be sure to post the video when we finally have it up.

Thanks for asking!
