I agree. I think what the white balance does is basically a custom re-balancing of radiation levels which allows to get correct readings in the end. It offsets the amount of NIR going to blue vs. red. 

I'm using a script to take photos as well and it's interesting that the internal calculation for exposure is off by about +1.66 ev. So I have to dial down exposure rates to -1.66 to get proper photos using that script. When taking photos normally I don't make such changes to the exposure settings. 

Sounds like an interesting experiment for today is to dial exposure down a bit and see if this improves the results.
