That sounds like a lot of lift in a good wind. Does that come mostly from the kite part or from the aerofoil shape of the balloon part?

Wait, doesn't air add weight, too? But it would register as weight (e.g., on a scale) only when it is in a medium lighter than air. A balloon full of water has weight, but it does not register as weight when it is under water. So it is "weightless" under water? I think I get it.
