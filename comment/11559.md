Hi abaker, I tried it on a Mac and was not able to get it to work, I'll have to look into this. For now, to use the csv file you can write out the complete path to the file. In line 36 of the main Processing code (WheeTrometer_3_0_GUI.pde) there is a piece of code that says: String[] wavedata = loadStrings("wavelength_on_pda_element.csv");, change this so that the path to the csv file is written out completely. It should look something like this: String[] wavedata = loadStrings("/Users/ben//Processing GUI/PDA_Spectrometer_Feb_9_2014/data/wavelength_on_pda_element.csv");.
