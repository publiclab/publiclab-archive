Hey great work!!!
Im new into NDVI, im working with a hexacopter and a dual camera setup....

i would like to ask you, what cameras did you use and how did you auto stick all the different images ?
Im working with Fiji plugin... with only 2 pictures, but in the future im planing to make a big area scan....
