[@warren](/profile/warren) yup, totally get that. REST API makes the most sense to me as well (for putting notes in and getting them out), and I'd be totally be open to using that. in the interim though, i've got about [5 more riffle analyses](https://github.com/walkerjeffd/riffle-ito-apps/tree/master/analyses) at the moment (and will probably be generating 2-3 per week if not more), so I just don't know how long it would take to implement the API (weeks, months?). and so I'm not sure what I can do in the mean time to get those into the PL system beside iframes or copy and paste (which is not something I really have time to do and goes against this whole reproducibility principle).
