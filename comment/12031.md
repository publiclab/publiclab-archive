Wow, USPS is fast. It looks like you already did a little assembly. How hard was it to screw on the orange leg brackets? And you added a camera! Sorry there is no parts list. I will get back to work on the instructions. In the meantime round up some super glue and thread locker. And small screw drivers. Is that an S100 you are going to mount on it? I can send measurements for locating the tripod screw hole for an S100.  
Thanks for the pic!
