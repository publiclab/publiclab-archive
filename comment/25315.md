I recently took a [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) course on this topic which offered some neat tools and practices. 

For best practices, here are some of the things they highlight:

- Never modify your raw data. Always make a copy before making any changes. (this was their biggest one, they brought it up repeatedly)
- Keep track of all of the steps you take to clean your data.
- Record metadata in a separate plain text file.
- Use data validation to prevent accidentally entering invalid data.
- Avoid spreading data across multiple tabs (but do use a new tab to record data cleaning or manipulations).
- Record zeros as zeros.
- Use an appropriate null value to record missing data.
- Donâ€™t use formatting to convey information or to make your spreadsheet look pretty.
- Place comments in a separate column.
- Record units in column headers.
- Include only one piece of information in a cell.
- Avoid spaces, numbers and special characters in column headers.
- Avoid special characters in your data.
- Data stored in common spreadsheet formats will often not be read correctly into data analysis software, introducing errors into your data.
- Exporting data from spreadsheets to formats like CSV or TSV puts it in a format that can be used consistently by most programs.

For tools, one they introduced that I really enjoyed for cleaning data was [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/). On the website they say "OpenRefine is a powerful tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with web services and external data." There's a good intro video on their homepage. Also, for the full lesson plans on that course I took, you can find the [syllabus, lessons, and resources they shared here](https://marwahaha.github.io/2019-05-30-nas/)!

Hope this helps!
