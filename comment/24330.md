 OK, i was able to build one using [@jiteovien](/profile/jiteovien)'s diagram; I remember at the Nueva School before MakerFaire last year, some of the kids were able to make a low-magnification microscope by not flipping the lens (unlike the [#community-microscope](/tag/community-microscope)) but simply by spacing it further away from the sensor. (you can see a [photo of the workshop here](https://publiclab.org/notes/bronwen/06-29-2018/community-microscope-thank-you) and [an update about it here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/the-community-microscope-kit/posts/2191026))

Here's a photo of what they did:

At first I thought I had to remove the lens and place it further away, but after struggling for a while, I realized I could just unscrew it /somewhat/ but not anywhere near all the way. 

It worked! Here's a photo of the setup. Like [@jiteovien](/profile/jiteovien) proposed, I just put the camera above, facing down through the hole, rather than looking up through it.

It took a LOT of light, so we may need to think how we can boost light in a more efficient way than using a ton of gooseneck LED lights. But I think it compares well with photos of microplastics from the [#babylegs](/tag/babylegs) page. 

Here's a photo of an SD card with a crude scale bar:

Compare to Max's photo from the [#babylegs](/tag/babylegs) page:

[@maxliboiron](/profile/maxliboiron), what do you think? It's not very crisp, but in terms of scale, does this work? 

If we need a lot more resolution for this to be useful, we can use one of the [nicer cameras from the Plus kit](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-24-2018/add-a-high-quality-webcam-to-your-community-microscope-kit).
