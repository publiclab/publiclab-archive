Hey everyone!  For what it's worth I was heavily inspired by this project [Tag Overflow](http://p.migdal.pl/tagoverflow/?site=stackoverflow&size=16), the code for which is [here](https://github.com/stared/tagoverflow) and from an initial version, [here](https://github.com/stared/tag-graph-map-of-stackexchange/blob/master/README.md).

My version didn't require any ongoing database queries because I just exported the tags table to csv and ran it from there.  The visualization only uses the top 256 tags (I think).  I'm not sure if you can have other processes concurrently running (as in workers?) but you could export that single table on a weekly basis and then run a program to calculate the rest.  I understand that even a single process can block the rest of the website but were it possible to run a separate process concurrently, it's not a very computationally intensive at all to create the tag co-occurrence graph and export it to a form (json, graphml) for visualization.
