For a photos from a red-filtered camera like the bluish photo above, in the Photo Monitoring plugin select the red channel to represent red and the blue channel to represent NIR. try selecting "stretch histogram" to see if that improves the result. 

To get more turquoise photos, the white balance of the camera might have to be altered.
