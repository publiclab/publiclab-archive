Yep, I think so.  The Digispark is only $9, I think, because it uses the ATTiny processor, which is super cheap, and uses a really tiny board.  It has really minimal memory for programming -- something like 6 Kb.  I'm not sure that'd be enough for the sort of sampling logic we'd want to run for the run on the Syhitech -- but it might. The larger worry for me about the Digispark is whether the serial connection would persist long enough that it'd function as a long-term data conduit.  But given that it's a <$20 experiment to try it out, we should give it a shot!  

But, right -- the cost of parts for something that simply measures e.g. the Syhitech output, and delivers it to a computer, while having as much memory as an UNO, and a 'real' USB connection, could be something like $7.  (For example: the same hardware we're using in the Riffle can do full USB, and the same hardware, in a relevant configuration, has been priced out on http:///mchck.org for $7 in parts.)  This Meter-Stick idea is intended to make something that's directly compatible with the Arduino IDE, and is as flexible and capable as an UNO or Leonardo (which might be overkill)>  I'd have to do the math for this Meter-Stick prototype, but it also might be in the same ballpark.  Looks like one can get the 32u4 for [about $4](http://octopart.com/parts/supplier--digi-key/search?q=atmega32u4&s=avg_price_asc&js=on) if one purchases 100 at a time; and the cost of the Meter-Stick PCB was about $10 for 3 on OSHPark.  The rest of the parts are cheap enough that the entire Meter-Stick could probably be put together for $10 in parts; probably a little less, if we optimized board space (and thus PCB cost), component prices, and etc.  And adding in the ~$5 Syhitech, and that's something like $15-$20 for the cost of parts.
