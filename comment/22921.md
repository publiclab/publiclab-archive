I know nothing about this topic, but here is the model I concocted from whole cloth to understand it.

Measuring conductivity of water with electrodes is based on measuring the electrical current flowing between the electrodes. If some of that current is being used to split water molecules into OH- and H+, then that current is not reaching the electrode (or else work is being done without conservation of energy). So it seems that it would not matter that the ions and cations are washed away in the river because the measurement of electrical current has already been altered. 

However, I would not be surprised to learn that my model of how electricity works is completely wrong.
