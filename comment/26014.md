I think the quickest/cheapest nitrate testing kits may be found in your local pet store (or online retailer) in the aquarium section.. you can get testing strips quite inexpensively (say, 50 test strips for less than $10, or more if you dig around to buy in bulk), and some are colormetric kits that involve some mixing of samples. 

These are probably affordable enough that you could try to identify spots for further testing, but will be a lot less accurate than the lab test, and wouldn't tell you anything about metals/bacteria/hormones. I've seen consumer tests for fecal coliform designed for people to test their home drinking water in the same price range, but don't know much more about them-- you might also look for what's available for folks that get their household water from private wells. 

I'm assuming all of these are pretty similar in that they can give you a ballpark sense of what might be in the mix, but you'd probably want to do some comparison testing and then follow up with a lab test if you needed actual numbers, but starting here could be helpful in helping to decide what sites to focus on.
