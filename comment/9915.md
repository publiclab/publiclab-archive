There's a lot to talk about here, but first, just to clarify - iframes are widely accepted as a way to embed a specific piece of media or content -- like a video, an interactive data display, or even a Github code snippet (gist). I think the reluctance we have is towards using iframes to post entire texts, where the research note wouldn't actually have any content in it besides an iframe. Also, a REST API would make it pretty straightforward to download all your research notes in JSON, XML, or whatever format. That seems like a reasonable thing to add.
