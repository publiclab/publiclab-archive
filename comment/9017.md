Nice thinking Chris.

[@code4maine](/profile/code4maine) I don't mean to discourage you from acquiring a quad, I just really like kites, and think of coastal areas (even without strong winds) as ideal kite spots.  At 64" x 41", I'm not surprised that the HQ Power Sled doesn't lift your camera without a stiff breeze.  Sled kites often need a good wind to keep their pull consistent, though i would expect 9- 12 mph would be sufficient given its surface area.
