[@shanlter](/profile/shanlter) [@rocket](/profile/rocket) Unfortunately, I was/am in a time crunch and just followed the parts list put together by [@shanlter](/profile/shanlter) without cross checking it with the assembly instructions. I've already ordered the LiPo battery and charger. Seems to be a couple of other issues: SKU-FIT0348 on the parts list is not the PH sensor in your discussion. Not a big deal (beyond being expensive), but it doesn't come with data adapter and cable. Is the correct part: SKU-SEN0161? Also, since I have to put in another order to DFRobot, are there 'orange-red-black' cables available? (local hobby store doesn't seem to carry them.) 

EDIT: or possibly SKU-SEN0169?
