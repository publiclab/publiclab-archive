Or, they are all 'bad' (noisy) to some degree ;-) The sharpness of the peak is still mostly a factor of slit, mechanical rigidity, being light-tight, etc. The last plot which shows (blue) so many separate spectra overlapped is a good indication of repeatability and my prototype has been consistent over time. The one detail that this data has observed is the detail of sharp peaks where noise and the fact that the peak is defined by just 1-3 pixels. The time-average method helps preserve that detail by avoiding averaging of a single frame's spectral data which tends to smear out the spectra.
