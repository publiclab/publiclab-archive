I have found this to be quite true! It's a neat phenomena. I dont think it can be used as a golden rule though. I can recall images that have one dominant feature like water, cement, or a white roof that while sharp can fall back in order by size. But its mostly true and is very useful if you want to just take a glance at a large set or if you are waiting for a set to transfer and you want to see the best imagery.
