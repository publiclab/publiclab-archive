I'm not sure burning paper or wood are hot enough to cause the atomic emission of elements like sodium. The doublet emission lines of sodium are produced by electrons hopping between shells and releasing energy. This might take more energy input than is present in burning wood or paper in open air at 1500Â°K. The orange glow of a wood fire is probably black body radiation which produces different colors as a function of temperature. Much hotter wood fires can have blue flames because of emissions from excited molecules.
