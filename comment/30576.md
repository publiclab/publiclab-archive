Previous methods could be somewhat hazardous.  To give an example, ammonia related chemicals often work their way into drug compounds.  It can be for the stoppers, the purified water, the drug vehicle itself, or many other places.  For a long time, the routine test for ammonia nitrogen used Nesslers reagent.  The problem- Nesslers reagent is mercury based. So the test for ammonia nitrogen would generate a bunch of mercury - which had all kinds of environmental issues.
