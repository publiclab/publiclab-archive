Changing the frequency range would require either changing the duty cycle of the 555 or modulating the amplitude.  I think the the probe (resistor) is modifying the amplitude.  If you want to lower the range you could wire in a potentiometer on pin 5 (control) on the 555 chip.  There is a good description here http://www.learnabout-electronics.org/Oscillators/osc44.php
