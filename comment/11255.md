1/4-in thick pieces make it easy to assemble things square and the glue results are strong. Hardwood is rigid and handles machining better. I started with the idea of cutting 'U-channel' with the table saw, then cut into slices and glue (inverted) to form slots. This would work, but opted for the drill as much less time for a proto. You could glue-up pairs of 3/4 material then cut to 1.5x2 in, rip a center channel and then slice. As for drilling, since there are only 2 sizes (but same widths) multiple pieces can be drilled at once - a drill-press helps. There are 3 'tricks' to note with drilling: 1) use fine-grain wood for better material uniformity, 2) side-clamp the material to offset drilling forces which can crack the material and 3) with drill bits, drill to size with several steps. Perhaps a better alternative, which could be faster, is using a mill-bit in a drill press with a stack of pieces side-clamped in a mill-type vise. (side note: the best glue for this is the 'yellow' woodworker glue as it's thicker, stronger and sets quick. works with the black paper as well.)
