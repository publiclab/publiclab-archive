A great memory shared my many of my biology students was mapping the campus of Western Carolina University in the sunny and warm Fall of 2010.  The photos they took and the map they made (with the assistance of Stewart Long) is STILL the top layer in GoogleEarth and GoogleMaps satellite view, despite more recent imagery of the surrounding area.  To my knowledge, it is still the biggest map Google has picked up from PublicLab and it still looks great.  The research note can be found here.
