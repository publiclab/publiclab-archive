Spectrometer laboratory setup
Fig. 1A illustrates the design of our spectrometer. Our spectrometer was based on the design used for the Public Labs webcam instrument and consisted of a 20 X 20 X 150 mm balsawood box containing a ~1 mm slit. We used a section of DVD for a diffraction grating. We had previously trialled acetate diffraction gratings though found that these warped and lost integrity from thermal expansion and contraction in outdoor environments. This issue adversely affected the ability to calibrate the instrument. We found that DVDs were much more resistant to temperature changes, facilitating greater stability in spectral measurements. The diffraction grating was mounted at a 45o angle to the incident light in order to align the diffracted spectra with our imaging device. In liu of a webcam as suggested by Public Labs  we used a Raspberry Pi NOIR camera with a pixel resolution of 2592 x 1944. This camera uses a Samsung Omnia CCD chip which has the IR cut filter removed. This allows the camera to capture visible and NIR wavelengths in its red, green and blue channels. We chose this camera because of its higher imaging resolution as compared to a webcam, greater ability to control exposures, as well as its ability to be controlled by the Raspberry Pi. The latter point was important for us as we intended this spectrometer to be used on small ground robots, such as our Little Blue that was trialled in Arkaroola in 2014. Using the Raspberry Pi enabled a light weight system that could be controlled wirelessly. The interior of our spectrometer was painted matte black in order to minimize stray light reflecting inside the instrument.
Test setup
Our instrument was intended to collect reflected spectra from materials of interest in order to assist in identifying mineralogical or biological composition. We thus designed two test scenerios, one indoors using a controlled, tungsten light source (Fig. 1B) and outdoors, using unfiltered sunlight (Fig. 1C).
	Fig. 2A-B illustrates our two spectrometer test setups. For the indoor setting we used a Miniblitz studio flash for our controlled light source. We used the tunsten-based photomodelling light on this flash unit as our light source. We desired a continuous spectrum light source capable of transmitting visible and NIR wavelengths suitable for analysis with our spectrometer. Our light source was placed at a distance of 25 cm from the sample and set at a 90o angle. The spectrometer was placed ~ 5 cm from the sample to prevent spectral mixing from the surroundings while precluding the spectrometer’s shadow falling on the sample. In the case of the outdoor setting illumination was achieved using direct sunlight on a clear day with no cloud cover
Following a 2 minute interval to allow both the photo lamp and camera ccd to warm up and stabilise, capturing of spectra was achieved by commanding the NOIR camera to take a photograph of the sample, and also an additional photograph of a specular reflector. Additional images were taken with the spectrometer slit covered in order to capture noise generated by the camera electronics, or dark frame current. This process enabled calibration of the spectral amplitude, obtaining the reflectance spectra of the sample, Rs, via the following formula:
Rs = (Im – Id)/(If – Id)							(1)
Where Im is the raw captured spectra of the sample, Id is the dark frame current and If is the spectra obtained from sampling the specular reflector lit by the photo lamp. In the case of the outdoor environment If is the spectra obtained from the specular reflector lit by sunlight. 
Calibration
We used a compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) in order to undertake wavelength calibration of our spectrometer We noted the spectral range of our instrument precluded identification of all peaks emitted by the CFL, thus after waiting 2 minutes for the CFL to warm up and stabilize, we captured its spectra and used the peaks listed in Table 1 for calibration. 

Colour	Origin	Peak wavelength (nm)
Dim blue	Mercury	436
Turquoise	Terbium	485-490
Green doublet	Terbium and Mercury	544, 546
Red	Europium	611
Table 1: CFL spectral lines used for wavelength calibration
The spectral sensitivity characteristics of the NOIR camera is not available for public release by the manufacturers. We thus used the If derived from sunlight to infer spectral sensitivity of each of the camera bands. The spectra of unclouded sunlight is well known and enabled determination of our camera sensitivity.
