You're right that if you put together a kit there are some quads around $500 that are fairly capable, but there is some significant setup involved usually.

15mph winds are pretty high. what kite are you using? one of the [9' Delta's in our kite kit](http://store.publiclab.org/collections/mapping/products/kite-mapping-pack) will lift a small camera in 7mph winds. We don't sell a super-low wind kite.  [The Fled](https://www.gkites.com/store/) will definitely lift your equipment in 6mph winds. 

Then there are Rokkakus, which are more "expert" kite with bridle adjustments and bowing adjustments needed.  but then again, flying quads isn't all automatic.  G-Kites [7.5' Rokakku](https://www.gkites.com/cgi-bin/store.cgi?search_request_button=yes&pid=177&cart_id=613098.12722&bklnk=Advanced%20Flying%20Machines), or [SkyDog's 7.5' Rokkaku ](http://www.pictureprettykites.com/single-line-kites/pirate-rok/) would do alright, both are fiberglass sparred and not as light as they could be.  Now, if you REALLY need some pull, cobra kites sells Premier Kites [9x10' carbon fiber sparred Rokkaku](http://www.cobrakite.com/rokkaku.html) that will very likely lift a LOT in very light wind.  It is $300 though.  

The FAA requires universities to get permits.  I don't really know what the deal is for secondary schools. We, as a non-profit, aren't allowed to fly them.
