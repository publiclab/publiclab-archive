Just that a really in-depth discussion on how this works can be found here: https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/04-18-2019/brainstorm-on-ways-to-use-colored-light-to-show-sensor-readings

which gets at both the programming behind it and some of the considerations of colorblindness, color meanings, etc that may be good justifications to decide to do things differently! Thanks!
