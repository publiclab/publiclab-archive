Hi! Very exciting note! Thanks for sharing. Just wondering, could you expand a little more on "When the calibration coefficients are calculated a graph showing the relationship between input pixel values vs corrected pixels is output to the screen so you can assess quality of calibration. The graphs are only meaningful if more than 2 calibration targets are used" - or provide some links to where we can learn more about this? 

Also, might you have specific links to "More information about the plugins can be found in the user guide that is available from the Github repository and by reading PLOTS research notes related to the photo monitoring plugin or calibration" that you could add?

Much appreciated!
