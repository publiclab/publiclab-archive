Hah, just saw that [@mathew](/profile/mathew) posted a link I was reading this morning, but forgot to include:  http://www.electroschematics.com/6923/555-low-voltage-operation/  

Perhaps we can drop the voltage of the 555 timer even lower than 1V (out of spec), and still get acceptable results.  Worth trying!
