I'm not sure I can tackle the complete redesign on a smaller card just yet, as I am just on my laptop this week. But I can change the text. 

Nick, if the vendor says light background, maybe we should stick with that? Can you upload some comparison images? Perhaps a black background helps with contrast, but could we place it on a white background with a block of black **nearby** so that the camera exposes well? 

How transparent is the tube? Is it a problem that I've reproduced writing on the tube; will it show through the tube and cause confusion? I could make the details very very light grey so they are just a guide...

Re: location, how anonymous do we want to encourage people to be? A photo of this card from a smartphone will already have pretty exact GPS location, which If we encourage people to upload, we may want to scrub or de-res by removing significant digits of GPS (or follow best practices for de-res'ing location -- this is a good question for [@jlev](/profile/jlev), actually).
