Yeah I was just checking out NOAAs National Digital Forecast Database (http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/rest.php#use_it) in the process if trying to connect the NOAA library on www.temboo.com with the equivalent GCal client library (https://live.temboo.com/library/Library/Google/Calendar/)    Apparently NOAA even has its own "Digital Weather Markup" format?  In any case, it looks like the Calendar API is going to be the steepest learning curve...
