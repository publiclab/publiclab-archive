Thanks Zengirl. I don't think you can buy a NASA Aeropod. You can license the technology from NASA and manufacture them, but I don't know if anyone has done that yet. If you don't license the technology from NASA, you are not allowed to use it without NASA's permission. You are also not allowed to modify it, so when I added a rigid pendulum I probably violated patent law. I am impressed that I could be penalized for trying to help.

The anemometer on the Aeropod air column profiler is a Kestrel 5500 pocket weather meter. You can buy one for about $300.00.  To measure wind speed, it has to be pointed into the wind. To do that on a kite flight, you could use a device with a tail that uses the wind to keep the Kestrel pointed into the wind. But NASA patented some version of that idea, so be careful or you could end up on the No Fly List like I probably am.

The Modern Device Wind Sensor I have been using does not have to be pointed into the wind so precisely, although it is somewhat sensitive to wind orientation. They say orientation influences the measurement by "about 15%" but they don't say which side of the sensor should be pointed into the wind. Regardless, a device to maintain the wind orientation is not as critical as it is with the Kestrel. 

Unfortunately my wind sensor fell prey to my inattention last night. It has been attached to the Picavet cross on a Saturn V Rig, and I had to replace the gear on the Picavet shaft. I was not being careful enough with the exposed sensor and broke off the business end of the thing.

There is a copper trace in the loop that is severed. I will try to repair it, but I don't know how sensitive it will be to a big glob of solder in that trace. I think I would epoxy on a strengthening shaft if I could have a do-over. And the sensor is open source, so I would not be breaking any laws if I did that.
