Super... I'll check the photo metadata in a bit, but a couple more suggestions:

* p2 of the guide looks a bit odd on my phone-- see below
* is there any way to open the folder of images in the gallery app? Using "intents" or something?
* some indicator for whether GPS, compass, and tilt are being recorded, like three icons that show or are Xed out?

This is looking great. Thanks!
