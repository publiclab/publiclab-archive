there is a 14" hoffman integrating sphere and controller on ebay right now for 995 or best offer that might be purchased and shared. I thought about buying it but can't swing it this month. I bet they would take $500. It probably needs a new bulb which is about $200 with the spectral radiance data last time I bought one. I could contribute $50.

There is also a way to correct a tungsten filament bulb to make it much closer to a black body source. Since the goal is to provide adequate performance at a low price this is probably a better idea.  http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/6736/1/inproc_326.pdf
