That's a good observation. The hotspot in these test images would tend to be toward the bottom around the shadow from Chris' head since that's where the camera was. Having a hotspot in the image isn't necessarily related to the oblique angle - that same phenomenon can be seen when images are acquired looking straight down (nadir) if the sun is fairly high. In that case you can see the hotspot and the point of specular reflection in the same image  at equal but opposite distance from the principal point. My experience with BRDF is mostly with pixel sizes of 30m and larger and it's quite different and apparently much more complex with close range imaging where we're resolving individual blades of grass. It sure would be nice to deal with BRDF but I need to put thought into how best to do that in different situation. Perhaps the best we can do is as you mention - keep it in mind. If you have thoughts about how to reduce BRDF effects or, better yet, use it to improve automated classification I'd be interested in hearing them.
