[@kksgandhi](/profile/kksgandhi) - Awesome! We recently had an OpenHour event with Cartosco.pe team in the autumn of 2020. As an open source community, Public Lab really loves when content can remain up so others can find it, learn from it, build off it, and spark conversations! We have a tag system that allows our community members to find relevant information based off their interests. When your user studies end this week -- no need to delete anything. You can just update our post to reflect [CLOSED] or [STUDY PERIOD ENDED] with the original content. Feel free to tag me if you have any other questions 😃
