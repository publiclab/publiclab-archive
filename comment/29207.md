Hi [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) Thank you for asking and for your concern. All Public Lab staff are safe. We've been reaching out to a lot of our friends and collaborators in the past couple days. All we've been in touch with are safe, but will defiantly be looking for support and resources in recovery. The links [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) shared above and on the /wiki/ida page are good. 

We have not been able to get into our office yet to see if there is any damage, so in the mean time our store is currently closed to new orders until we're able to get going again.
