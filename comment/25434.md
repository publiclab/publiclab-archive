You might consider Syncthing: https://syncthing.net/ It allows you to synchronize folders across multiple computers (including android phones!) It works seamlessly across NATs and behind routers. I wrote a blog post about setting it when I first started using it: https://blog.bierfaristo.com/content/syncthing The main trick there was using an SSH tunnel to configure both ends of syncthing at the same time, which simplified things a bit. It also has a mode to put things, but not sync back, which is good for, say, cellphone cameras (e.g. when I take a picture, it gets automatically uploaded to my computer(s) as soon as I'm back in wifi range, but if I delete the image from the phone, it leaves it on the computer.)

Syncthing is simple to install via apt: https://apt.syncthing.net/
