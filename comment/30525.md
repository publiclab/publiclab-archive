         With environmental change it puts many animals at risk of extinction. Due to environmental change habitats are loss and degraded, not to mention the overexploitation by humans hunting and overfishing now that our population keeps growing. With that in mind, climate change, pollution, and invasive species have only made that risk even greater. Humans have overexploited the natural habitat of most animals then cause more pollution as time goes by. “The factories are hurting the fish; the plastic is killing the sea turtles; the penguins need it to be colder.” With climate change affecting more animals by the day it only degrades most animals' lands and cause deforestation. There is a polar bear crisis happening as we live our everyday lives. They aren’t getting what they need to survive and won’t be able to adjust. 
        To add on, other species invading other environments that aren’t meant for their kind has interacted with the food chain and caused reducing preys and predators. Even if the invading species were to adapt to their new environment to survive it contradicts the necessary food chain. The food chain is very important system without it there will be ton of extinct animals and that’s exactly what is happening now.
