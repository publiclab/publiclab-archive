Hi, I guess I still think a diagram of sorts would help explain exactly what functions and states would be encapsulated in each component, and perhaps would help me understand the distinctions you're making -- I'm especially interested in which parts manage the "state" of the system and which are required for running. Notice we are trying to make:

1. the system runnable without a gui (in nodejs)
2. the modules as simple as possible so they can be written in a short and standard way by anyone
3. the whole system usable as a library inâ€‹multiple applications

So another thing to talk about is what specifically Vue.js and the state machine library would make possible that is am improvement (beyond just optimization) and what possible drawbacks they might have. 

Thanks for your extra work to articulate your proposal, it's much appreciated.
