I'll play around with those pins. The odd thing is that I have inserted hundreds of those pins in suspension shafts over the past three years, and never once bent one open to make the task easier. So I guess I am not a good test subject for determining how to make the task easier. 

I'm pretty sure there should be at least one pin through the shaft at each end to ensure that it cannot slip off. That kind of safety issue cannot be trusted to chance or friction. Most KAP flights are gentle rides, but some unexpectedly become violent wind-whipped journeys that can easily pull things apart (or break wooden dowels with abandon). It's a challenge to find the happy medium between overbuilding rigs and keeping them lightweight enough to be useful, but there are no load bearing wooden dowels or friction mounts on KAPtery rigs.

There are two issues with the KAPtery leg bracket. One is that it needs just a little more room for the nylon nuts to slip in against the angled tube. The other is that the angled tube could be stronger. The bracket is printed on its back, as in the diagram below, so the deposited layers are horizontal. The fused layers are usually the weakest part of a 3D printed part, and a strong dowel inserted into the angled tube can be levered so that the layers could separate. I have made the sides of the tubes thicker, but additional strengthening might be good.

I always print leg brackets in ABS for additional strength, and a several millimeter thick layer of solid ABS is printed halfway up the part where it is most vulnerable (the rest has a dense honeycomb of ABS). 

It would be nice to start over and redesign this part, but there are lots of critical dimensions and angles that must be recreated exactly, so I have avoided the task.
