(Christian) Today I learned that even the tiniest bit of plastic can severely cause harm to our bodies over a period of time. Plastics so small that they are compared to the size of a single strain of hair. These things can enter your blood, food, water etc. Leading to harm to your body in the future since we consume so many on a daily without notice. When doing research, you can discover that we consume about 5 grams of microplastics weekly.
