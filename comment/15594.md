Definitely still in development! I think some icon/color system, and maybe better dividers, to help people sort by how mature activities are, is a great idea. We could also do tabbing if things start to get too complex. 

We could also /only/ display starter activities, with a button at the bottom to display "6 draft activities" or "8 more advanced activities" -- stuff like that. We have a framework now and it's not too hard to keep refining. What would you like to see/try first? Divisions by category?
