I think (hope) Jeff is describing something like this:  

I make a map by carefully aligning photos, writing a description, and annotating it. I save that view, and whenever I return I can see that view of my map. Anybody else can see that view, and they can also tweak my image alignment, edit my description, and/or make their own annotations and save that new view. Now everybody can see and edit two views of the map. But those two views will never change unless edited or deleted by the person who saved them.

A harder question might be, Can anybody add new aerial photos to a map to extend or improve it? Only the original map maker should be able to delete aerial photos, so probably only the original maker should be able to add more. If you want to add more, start over with a new map.
