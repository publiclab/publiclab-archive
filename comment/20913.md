Yes and we might ask [@stefannibrasil](/profile/stefannibrasil) and [@milaaraujo](/profile/milaaraujo) (I'm on my phone, can you mention their publiclab usernames?)
  

Perhaps it could be a sort on an existing API method?

I checked the API's we have and currently we do not have any API that fetches people who have commented/posted (will confirm with [@warren](/profile/warren) as well) .  I guess this API will help in statistical analysis which is also our project for Outreachy intern .  [@warren](/profile/warren)...What do you think ?
