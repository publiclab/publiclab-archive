 Hi [@ishaGupta18](/profile/ishaGupta18) - thanks, great question. If you drag in a csv file to this comment window, you'll see - it stores it using the Paperclip gem, actually in the Image model (poorly named, sorry!). But we can probably develop a section of the profile page which lists CSVs, because i think there is a content type field on that table:

Hope that helps!!!
