Thanks Pat.  I just edited the post above to indicate that you don't really need Google Earth Pro to do this type of thing.  The free version will not open geoTIFFs, but you can open and manually position the jpg produced when you export a MapKnitter map. The free version will not record a video, but free screen capture software can record everything displaying on your screen (minus the cursor) so you can make movies that way. I have used [Microsoft Expression Encoder](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/Encoder4_Overview.aspx) to do this with great success.
