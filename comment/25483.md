Whoa, what if the strainer were the protective enclosure for the camera itself??? I'll copy that idea back to the post I just made about pi rigs. [#19578](/n/19578)

I was also thinking about this some-- it seems like it might be reasonably easy to extend the antenna on the Raspberry Pi itself (as below): [https://hackaday.com/2017/03/07/adding-an-external-antenna-to-the-raspberry-pi-zero-w/](https://hackaday.com/2017/03/07/adding-an-external-antenna-to-the-raspberry-pi-zero-w/)  There are external antennae for other models of the Rasp Pi, so possible sizing up would help (though we'd loose the compact size, which is really nice). That said, I am very interested in the parabolic extender. Let's try that!
