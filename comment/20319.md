That's a great idea to block it from including signatures below the "--"
  

That would make what i'm about to say here a non-issue, that the code misinterpreted the link to my twitter account "[twitter.com/lizbarry](http://twitter.com/lizbarry)" (text is [@lizbarry](/profile/lizbarry)) as a call out to a Public Lab account which it expanded in markdown in the comment to&nbsp;[[[@lizbarry](/profile/lizbarry)](/profile/lizbarry)](http://twitter.com/lizbarry).&nbsp;
