Oh, I like that idea of including some parts in the mapping kits so the user can get started attaching their camera. That could be a nice touch. I guess the challenge will be to include parts that the user is comfortable trusting their camera to. But I guess no beginner is ever going to feel comfortable attaching their camera to a kite line. 

Maybe the aluminum rig could be simplified so no suspension shaft is required. The top of the aluminum part can attach directly to the flexible tubing and wire (the top of the pendulum that the kite line wraps around). Then the only parts needed are: aluminum part, thumb screw, tubing, stiff wire, maybe a cotter pin. An plastic bottle can be added for camera protection. 

I don't know how much it would cost to have the aluminum part fabricated. Maybe a lightweight, simple version would not cost much. A simple rig like that could add value to the mapping kits so you could charge a few extra bucks for them.
