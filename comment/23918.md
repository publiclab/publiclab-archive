 Hi Vibhor! Sorry we've been slow getting responses in to this. Thanks for the proposal! One thing that I wanted to ask a bit more about was how the increasing complexity of the system could be better supported by tests, to become more stable -- i think this is a key to building and maintaining many of these more complex and exciting use cases! 

I see you have a number of UI tests planned. How could we distinguish between tests that ALL UI implementations should fulfill, vs. those that our default UI must fulfill? 

Second, could we do more to standardize our CLI tests, and to run module tests in the CLI and/or node context as well, so as to ensure that they run in a node environment? 

Thirdly, I was thinking there are a number of things that could be done to improve performance in the UI, for example optimizing the preview "resize" operation. I think there's an issue open for this, just FYI. 

Finally, we still have substantial UI code in the /examples/lib/ folder. Perhaps consolidating that code could be part of the UI testing work as well.

Thanks for a great proposal!
