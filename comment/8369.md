Hi Jeff -- great idea! That's how they currently do it on the mchck.org design, too.  

For reference, students could use the [LeoStick Eagle](http://www.freetronics.com/products/leostick#.Uw5aElSx0wJ) design files, here:

https://github.com/freetronics/LeoStick

As well as the latest Eagle design files for the latest version of the thermal flashlight board ("REVA"), here:

https://github.com/Pioneer-Valley-Open-Science/thermal-flashlight/tree/master/REVA

I think a good design would be to have the "pcb usb" pads on the bottom of the board, so that the USB connector is still placed on the top, keeping all of the surface mount components on one side of the board -- easier to manufacture at home, and cheaper when outsourcing ...
