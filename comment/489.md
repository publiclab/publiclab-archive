Warren -- Most clever and elegant! Spread the cameras a bit more and you will have room to use Brooxes camera keepers (red thumb screws).  Those are way handy and only $2 apiece. For example, did you try it with the existing unused hole at the opposite end of the T?  It should balance without tilting. But then it would require a bigger cover if you wanted to protect the whole thing.  

I am looking forward to your synchrony solution.
