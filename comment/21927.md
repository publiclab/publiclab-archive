Thanks for the advice. How are the calibration coefficients calculated? I need to take photos of >50 trees in a glasshouse, so even within one session the photos will be taken from different angles and most probably with different exposure settings. That's why I was thinking to include the reference targets in each photo.

Regarding the reference targets, I agree that even matt tiles are not perfect. I also tried matt paint paper samples from a local store - a little better, but similar. My newest purchase is a few pieces of felt (material) - blackish plus a lighter and a darker grey/beige. I also bought two pieces of rough sandpaper (black and white), but particularly the black one seems rather shiny. I'm thinking to use them all, better to have too many than too few. My colleague will be holding a white coreflute sheet as background for the images. It shouldn't be difficult to stick a few pieces of darker and lighter felt (and/or sandpaper) on the sides, and make sure they are visible in each photo.

I'm also thinking to get a white umbrella to provide a more diffuse light, but I'm not sure it will be possible as there's not much space in the glasshouse.
