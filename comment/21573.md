[@edie_blues](/profile/edie_blues)  I like the design you posted on github more than the current design.  Dividing the page into three columns utilizes the space better.  I like [@warren](/profile/warren)'s inclusion of the blog in the center section as well as current activity.  It seems that current activity and trending are very similar information.  I'd rather see trending replaced with a listing of active projects.  I find that more interesting and useful even if they are not yet sparking enough activity to be "trending".  Current activity and the Blog seem to dominate the space. 

 Is there a way the My Activity side could actually list research/projects the user has posted and have current questions/comments about those things appear there as well?  

I like the idea of the Near Me listing, but it doesn't need to be huge.
