This is fascinating! Can you say any more about the tests you would run on these samples? I imagine it would vary depending somewhat on your concerns, but I'm curious about what lab services people should be thinking about if they are interested in this method.

I 'm adding a link to Brooklyn Bio here: https://www.brooklyn.bio/

If people are interested in working with Karen Dannemiller's lab, are there ways to connect and move forward?
