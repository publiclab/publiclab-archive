Ok.  It's gone about the way you would expect.  Formal sources say it is safe to live i n East Palestine.  But the average Joe is still having trouble selling his house.  And to be honest, personally, I wouldn't feel safe living there.  New data has popped up showing that the burning of the railcars was not necessary ( by the ntsb).  The damage is done.
