In the commercial spectrometer measuring milk fat%, the range is mostly between 600-1100nm. Could you correlate the peaks with the actual fat% in this (355-640nm) range?
I am starting working on this project : Milk fat% determination with a diy spectrometer in the range 600-1100. I am using fridge lamp (15w) as a source. But its gets really heated up. Also thinking on other sources such as multiple LEDs to make the whole spectra.
