I haven't seen this happen in part because it runs a /long/ time on a battery, but I have seen it when running on a solar panel without enough sunlight. It would fail and reboot every second or so, so the light would blink.&nbsp;
  

Recently we changed the firmware so that it waits 2-3 seconds to start up. The idea was that it'd try to run for 2-3 seconds, before turning the light on, so that it could "test" whether there's enough power. And if there was, it'd start showing a light. Otherwise, it'd just stay dark (although you may see some of the really tiny lights blinking as it boots up).&nbsp;
  

That way, if power is too low, it wouldn't annoyingly blink a lot, but rather would reboot over and over but never get to the point where the light goes on. We're still testing how well this works.&nbsp;
