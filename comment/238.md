Adam Griffith reported back that: 

>Beaufort County, SC contracted with Fugro Earth Data for the image acquisition. This is a very expensive technique, at least they charge a TON for it.  Maybe even 100 K minimum.
>"Fugro EarthData operates multiple Leica ADS40 airborne digital sensors outfitted with the second-generation SH-52 sensor heads for digital aerial imagery acquisition at pixel resolutions ranging from 5 cm to 2 m." - http://www.fugroearthdata.com/servicessubcat.php?subcat=digital-photogrammetry
