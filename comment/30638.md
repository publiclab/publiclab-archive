Deposition-water transforms into a solid without going through the liquid phase. (Exothermic reaction) 
Sublimation- transforms into a vapor without going through the gas stage.  endothermic- chemical; reaction when more energy is needed when released. Infiltration- slower moving water. It can soak into the ground during a process.
