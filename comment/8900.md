Jeff, all of the photos that day were in bright sunshine under cloudless sky. You can see the afternoon progress in the four panel NDVI for Mobius 2007 as the shadow of the tripod and my arm swing into the white cedar branches. It has to be possible to find a slightly better white balance setting for blue filters, but it might be more important to see how Rosco Fire filters, (or other red Roscos) work. Maybe Mathew can send me some.
