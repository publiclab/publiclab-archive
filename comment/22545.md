Okay, re-accomplished the introduction. Wrote it in something else and copy/paste to avoid me screwing something up. Not sure what's been done since yesterday, but the image loaded fine and things worked as expected.  Nice! When all my hardware has arrived I'll add more of the process, code, etc. 

Still feeling my way around the Public Lab wiki area so if I've done something amiss, feel free to change and/or let me know what I should have done. Cheers.
