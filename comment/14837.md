Just a catchup here:

I've continued to tinker with the idea, and have a few notes.

The two ways to add power to the camera seem to be through attaching l larger capacity cell directly to the board, via the tiny JST connector, and by supplying power from an external source, via the USB port.

The internal battery provided with the stock Mobius camera is incredibly strong for its size. It allows for roughly ten days of photos, taking it at the highest frequency allowed in the power saving mode. Any setting which takes photos at a longer frequency than every 5 minutes puts the camera into hibernate, so at 6 min. intervals, this gives you 10+ days of operation at room temperature (assuming heat/cold might affect battery life). 

A photo every hour would extend the total life of the deployment, but it's not known if it would do so by a factor of 10, or something more or less. This would be a great future test. But of course, testing it directly could take a ton of time. Better to do the test with a meter, and be an engineer about it.

I have so far had issues with trying to extend this via usb power application. I've tried using the unit pictured above, the solar phone charger. It appeared to be working to apply power, essentially recharging the onboard battery. But after leaving the camera unattended for 2 weeks, I found it powered down, and photos had stopped after the same 10 day spell.

Not sure why.

I recently bought a high capacity 10000mha external Li battery and am currently running a long-term test to see if it can outlast the 10 days in this way. My hope is that by using a simpler cell (non-solar, battery only), it may work. 

I have yet to try soldering up a cell to connect direct to the board. I am focussing on using non-invasive ways to supplement power to the stock camera, as this would be much more easily replicated, and easier to swap out fresh cells for old ones in  the field. 

I have also been playing with super-simple waterproof housings for these cameras. I think the winner is the method of taking a known waterproof/watertight container, and applying a flashlight lens (glass circle) using silicone adhesive. The obvious choice is a mason jar or nalgene bottle, but there are many low-cost cases by Pelican, or phone service boxes or other outdoor electrical boxes that could serve this purpose. 

I've currently deployed a simple housing made out of a Tyvek postal shipping bag, which I cut out a hole and gooped up a glass lens onto the surface of. Then I rolled the top of the bag like a standard dry-bag and clipped it using a binder. This allowed me to stowe the camera and external battery in a water-resistant way that I hope would allow it to "breath" any condensate or pressure, but still protect the gear. Time will tell, but with this weather, it may be a lot of time.

The advantage of this method is that Tyvek can be drawn on, allowing you to get sophisticated with camo in an urban setting. It doesn't look like an electronics item, just like some vague shape, which would be an advantage in many settings. 

I should also mention I'm using a ribbon extension cable to allow me more flexibility in mounting the lens in a housing. This is meant for dashcam use, but is pretty slick for fitting this into tight spaces. It would allow you to, for example, put a lens module in a deal like this:

[![51jtvRLg__L._SL1000_.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/016/820/large/51jtvRLg__L._SL1000_.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/016/820/original/51jtvRLg__L._SL1000_.jpg)

Then have the cable go back to a waterproof junctin box that held the camera/battery. This kind of a thing would disappear in an urban setting, where theft or discovery would be a big threat to getting your data. 

I'm fired up about the potential here. I think further tweaks to this basic tool could lead to real victories in the short term. Photographic data is solid, and actionable. Check the latest [blog post](https://publiclab.org/notes/mlamadrid/06-22-2016/documenting-runoff-with-photography) for more on this idea. 

What else do people see here? Anyone have experience with making housings around this camera? If anyone is interested in helping tinker with either the battery/power parts of this, or the housings, please let me know in this thread!

Thanks
