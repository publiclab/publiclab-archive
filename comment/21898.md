Hi Chris,
I made a simple test earlier today, so far only managed to look at the JPEG file data (I have an old code for reading DNG into Matlab (based on Rob Sumner's detailed guide, you can find a pdf online), but I need to fix a few things in it first. The results below are solely based on JPEG files and thus certainly introduce some error.

I took three photos, all with the same settings (ISO, aperture and shutter speed, white balance), with:
1) no lens filter (thus only the Midopt DB660/850 in camera)
2) Hoya R72 lens filter (blocking visible light)
3) Hoya IR cutoff filter (blocking near infrared)

Image 1 was a little overexposed and Image 2 was a little underexposed, which was unavoidable if I wanted to keep the settings unchanged.

As reference targets, I used 10 different ceramic tiles as well as dry and wet grass and three leaves. The camera was on a tripod.

Unfortunately, when taking the photos I forgot about white balance, which was set on the red tile a few days earlier. The same WB was used in all photos.

I imported the JPEG images into Matlab and calculated the mean pixel value in all three channels within 17 polygons representing my different targets (tiles, grass and leaves). The photos as well as a simple spreadsheet with the obtained values are here:

Results in a nutshell:

At least with the white balance set on a red tile, the red channel pixel values in Image 1 (camera only) are very similar to those in Image 3 (with IR cutoff lens filter), meaning a very low contamination with NIR of the red channel, regardless of target (tiles or plants).

Similarly, blue pixel values are very similar between Image 1 (camera only) and Image 2 (R72 filter), meaning a low contamination of the blue (NIR) channel with red light (particularly in case of plants; the difference was a little higher for some of the tiles).

The green channel seems to be most messy.

I'll be happy to write more (perhaps in a separate thread) once I have looked at the raw files... which may take some time as I can't figure out how to omit applying (or undo if applied automatically) white balancing.
