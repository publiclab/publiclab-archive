Hi, [@nanocastro](/profile/nanocastro) -- we've been adding a lot of nice features to wiki pages to make them good project landing pages, with a Q&A, activities listing, etc -- any interest in porting some of the info from this page over to a MACA wiki page? 

Example: https://publiclab.org/lego

This is also the first step in our Community Kits program if you have any interest in our hosting your kit or helping to distribute it! https://publiclab.org/wiki/kits#Community+Kits
