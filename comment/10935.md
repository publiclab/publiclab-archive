Himmm...I was aware of straylight's great research note but the linearity you mentioned there is not about webcam but about peak heights vs. concentration (i.e. Beer's Law) I believe...Beer's Law says the log of the ratio of the intensities (I_out/I_in) gives you the absorbance A at a given wavelength... And limitations of this law are more significant for very high and very low concentrations (http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2012/05/ultraviolet-visible-uv-vis-spectroscopy-%E2%80%93-limitations-and-deviations-of-beer-lambert-law/)

AUC is little different and shown to be more robust...

But I have to dig little more to figure out if I am correctly evaluating my findings...Thanks a lot for the comments...
