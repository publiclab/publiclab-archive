Sure, I've just uploaded ORF files for all three images to the google drive (link at the end of my post).

Unfortunately I couldn't find any information about the Bayer filter arrangement for my Olympus camera. I assumed it was RGGB (RG - first two pixels in row 1, GB - first two pixels in row two). The order you mention (RGRG) is the same. I tried with using the other three options, but got very weird results.
