Awesome!

> PurpleAir air quality monitors send data about particles in the air to the web via WiFi. One version of the PurpleAir monitor saves the data to a microSD card. The number of particles in five size classes are reported in addition to three EPA PM standards (PM 10, PM 2.5, and PM 1.0). The devices cost $180 to $260. PurpleAir is not open source, but they provide a lot of information about the hardware. The $259 PA-II-SD seems to include the following components:

Especially for outdoor monitoring, it is handy to have temperature and humidity data when interpreting the particle results._
> 
> The Nano Data Logger version of the particle monitor can be assembled without soldering. The Arduino Nano snaps into the logging shield which includes an SD card slot and real-time clock. The Nano is a 5 volt Arduino and the Plantower sensor requires 5 volts. The BME280 sensor requires 3 volts. The Nano has one 5v pin, one 3v pin, and two ground pins so seven DuPont wires can be slid on to make all the needed connections.

> Making connections to the PMS7003 sensor is a little confusing. It has a 10-pin connector which does not fit anything I have around the house. Mine came with a handy connector and cable with [Molex 053261-0871](https://www.molex.com/molex/products/datasheet.jsp?part=active/0532610871_PCB_HEADERS.xml) terminations. I didn't have anything to plug that connector into, but that is not required. The connector that plugs into the sensor also has regular 0.1 inch pins for the four important connections. In fact, only three of these are required to use the sensor (power, ground, TX). Adafruit has [good instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/pm25-air-quality-sensor/arduino-code) for making the connections.

These seemed more interesting that the BME280 temperature-humidity-pressure sensors in the PurpleAir monitors. The third monitor I built had an LCD which displayed PM 2.5 in real time.

> 
> The first test of the monitors was to operate three of them together to see if they sensed the same thing. The monitors were directly above my woodstove so I assumed I would record a pulse of particles and gas everytime I opened the stove door to add wood. The monitors collected data from the sensors every second and computed an average of 60 readings. So an average result was saved to SD card about once per minute.

> _Figure 9. Six days of PM 2.5 data from three PMS7003 particle sensors on my mantle. The letters in the middle panel: a. I cooked some bacon (I have no kitchen exhaust fan and the kitchen is 15 feet from the woodstove.) b. I tossed some wood ashes into the woodstove fan (which blows into the room). c. I was invited to Thanksgiving so I took Sensor [#2](https://publiclab.org/n/2) and ran it during dinner. The other two sensors stayed home alone. d. I tossed some more ashes into the fan (fun things should be done more than once). e. I vacuumed the room (some fun things make a mess). f. I accidentally spilled some wood ashes into the fan. g. I cooked pancakes (Wow). h. I don't know what this or the later peaks are because I got tired of writing everything down._
> 
> During the test the three PMS7003 sensors responded very similarly to indoor pollution events. This is very encouraging. Wood ashes must be too big to register strongly as PM 2.5 because there were a lot of ashes in the room and the sensor response was subtle. Cooking with oil in a hot pan and adding pancake batter produces a lot of PM 2.5 (also PM 1.0 and PM 10). It was 5Â°F outside so I didn't open a window, but I have to remember to do that next time. It took several hours to clear the air.
