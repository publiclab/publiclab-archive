I had a similar experience when I was figuring out how to copy old film negatives. The best (very expensive) scanner at Middlebury College made a blurry mess, so I just took a digital photo with a [close up lens and good camera](http://fastie.net/copy-that/). The resolution was much better, but I only got about 100 pixels/mm (100 µm/pixel).  With another extension tube on the lens this could probably be improved by a factor of three or four (20-30 µm/pixel). That's not good enough for PM 2.5, so a longer extension tube would be required. But that might be doable.
