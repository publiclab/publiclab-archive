        A carnivore is an organism that feeds on off the flesh of another organism. The four spheres that make up planet Earth are the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. 
Omnivore- an organism that eats plants and other living animals, ex. Baboon. Three biotic series of living organisms in a biome: producers, consumers, and decomposers. Biome - an area classified according to the species that live in that location. Districts with the potential of having a Burmese python attack incorporate southern states like Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and indeed Louisiana. There's a potential for their populations to blow up within the south U.S. since we have a comparable climate to their domestic locale of south Asia.  There are 7,969,883,712 people on earth today and 779,667,820 people with no access to a safe water source. Thanks to Public Labs
