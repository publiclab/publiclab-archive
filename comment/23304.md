 Suggestions- 
Identify polymers used in products produced.  Hopefully, this will be supplied by Aluf.  
Identify possible hazardous ingredients of products.  Hopefully, manufacturer will provide this in an SDS.  But, no guarantee.
Identify air and water test sites down stream and down wind from the site ( often times these are at water treatment plants, at least for water).
Identify decomposition products of polymers ( hopefully contained in SDS).
Check and see if there was any variation in test data ( say pH) when a the fire happened or odors happened.

If PVC is present, large amounts of HCl would have been produced.  This should have shown up in air and water.  It might even have shown up on some of the buildings as degraded bricks.

After this work is done,  it is what testing needs done on the local environment.  Depending on what is generated when the product degrades, test for that.  For example, again with PVC, Tin is a possibility.
