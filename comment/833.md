I created a GitHub repo for the IamgeJ/FIJI macro. I think you can access it by going to: https://github.com/nedhorning/RegisterPhotos.git

If that doesn't work please let me know. This is my first experience with GitHub and although I have some experience with SVN it might take a while to get the hang of the social aspect of GitHub.

I added a more robust clipping method. My next step is to write a short guide to use the macro and find ways to deal with image-pairs that fail because of an insufficient number of matching points generated by SIFT. An easy option is to implement bUnwarpJ but that take much longer to do the registration. I'm looking at alternatives and any suggestions are welcome.
