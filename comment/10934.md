Automatic exposure control is *not* disabled -- but some tests have shown webcams to be pretty linear: http://publiclab.org/notes/straylight/05-13-2013/using-the-spectroscope-for-analysis-of-concentration-beer-s-law But you can also take two spectra at the same time, as we believe webcams have equal exposure across a single image or frame. 

This is great.
