[@warren](/profile/warren) Totally forgot that I have this week off as a holiday. Monday is the main festival (BTW, Happy Holi, everyone) but I'll try to stay online as much as I could. Ping me up whenever you're free. Could not work more on the scripts today because I had been working on the containerization. Hopefully, we would be able to provide a container-ed alternative to the usual development workflow and then automate almost every single bit of it by the end of this week (stay tuned :D)
