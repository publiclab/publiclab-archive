Hi! Do you think you could flesh out (in smaller pieces) exactly what you'd be working on in a checklist of sorts? You could copy in stuff from the relevant Github issues, and link to them -- that'd be really helpful!

Remember: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-18-2018/software-outreach-modularity-is-great-for-collaboration

https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/1832

And this example of upgrading to Rails 4.1: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/1799

See how the existing 4.2 one has a kind of checklist of things that have to be completed to merge the changes? 

Thanks a lot!!!

I also wanted to suggest that this is a big synchronous project where many changes would happen in a single PR, so not as modular as other possible projects. If you wanted to explore other options, there are some promising issues or ideas in https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/milestones!
