 [@warren](/profile/warren) may be we can have new project in Image Sequencer as the text overlay was already done 😃 . I have an idea may be we can have a new UI with or without previews and https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/issues/856 this can also be included in it. And few new modules for image sequencer. What do you say about it????
