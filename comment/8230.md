An oil train, presumed to be full of bakken Oil, spilled on tracks between Red Wing and Winona MN along the Mississippi River.
I photographed the site, and the putrid orange oil.
I would like to use the kit to help find out how much oil is spilled, what is in this orange stuff, and get an idea how much might go in the river and affect the river, which is a major migratory flyway
