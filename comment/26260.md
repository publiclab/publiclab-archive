 I am telling a advice about to use the Perfect construction technology and proper [Admixtures](https://cementconcrete.org/concrete/what-are-concrete-admixtures-types/2067/) in concrete , if well is [constructed with concrete](https://cementconcrete.org/material-testing-guide/aggregate-crushing-value-test/1256/) , that protect well 
 from the percolation of Nitates in the well water.
