In regards to your comment "grooves in the DVD-R surface must be oriented as close to parallel with the spectrometer slit as possible," in the past I've kept the DVD-R in wedge form, not cutting a rectangle. That way you can line up the bottom of the DVD-R curve with the bottom of the spec. My thought is this helps keeps the grooves oriented.
