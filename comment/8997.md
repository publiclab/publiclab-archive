One of the other features we're adding to mapknitter is that it will recognize the geo coordinates stored in images' EXIF data, and the ability to embed non-map images.  This could work well for cross-platform offline use-- photos could be taken in the field with cellphones and brought back and uploaded into mapknitter, where they would automatically be placed.  While the field notes wouldn't automatically end up in mapknitter, the images could then be annotated in the platform.
