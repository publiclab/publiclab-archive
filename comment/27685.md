Here's the link to[ NAICS codes for Plastic](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&TVD=118464&CVD=118467&CPV=3261&CST=01012012&CLV=3&MLV=5). ** I would make a State Records Request to your state EPA for all facilities coded 3261**. Unless your state is extremely dumb, like mine, the HW-1 (Hazardous Waste form [#1](/n/1))  NAICS codes are among the first things that the facility sends the agency before getting a permit.
