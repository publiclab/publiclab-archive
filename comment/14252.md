Sorry I missed some questions.

- Calibration targets work outside or in a greenhouse.
- Calibration targets are hard to find and very expensive. But some companies are developing new targets for this purpose. It's also possible to make your own if you have access to a spectrometer. You can also use common materials with known spectral reflectivity. This note has some sites where you can find spectral data for common materials: <https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/11-01-2013/why-a-red-filter-should-work-well-for-ndvi>.

- Most of the notes at Public Lab about calibrating NDVI are by Ned Horning: https://publiclab.org/profile/nedhorning

- Soil does not work well for calibration because its reflectivity changes as its moisture content changes. If you know the reflectivity of the black plastic in the wavelength bands you will use to compute NDVI, you could use that. But black plastic is shiny so its reflectivity will change as the angle changes. Also it is very dark and will be underexposed in many photos in which case it provides no information for calibration. A medium light and a medium dark target would be better.
