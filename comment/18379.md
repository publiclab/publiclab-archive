Totally understand where your coming from , its very possible im having some loss because of that, to account for the possible over bright light source I built in a filter area , where one could insert a paper filter or what ever form of filter they would like . I'm still working on getting the light source to a good level so it doesnt interfere with the readings . I'm going to try your yeast method and see where that takes me. Thanks for the Info Holger
