The RTC can be set to shutdown and wake the AT328P, it just uses another pin that could be used for a sensor.  [@donblair](/profile/donblair) left an exposed pin available on the board, and wire can be soldered to it and attached to one of the header pins (not sure which on) I don't have a riffle in front of me this second but it looks like pin D5 in the riffle schematic. [@donblair](/profile/donblair) correct me if I'm wrong/tell folks where that pin can go.
