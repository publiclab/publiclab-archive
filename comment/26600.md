Hello,
I know that this thread is quite inactive but maybe still someone with experience is hanging around. My question is about the mentioned problem on navigating the balloon in wind. I fully understand, that this is a problem having the balloon attached to just one line. What about attaching the balloon to three lines to keep the balloon in place? Spreading these three lines apart on the ground would limit the balloons movement in the horizontal. I understand, that this limits the possible height as distance of corners on the ground needs to be adjusted to the height but would that be possible? Or is the balloon changing height during winds, so it sinks rapidly? Do I miss something in my thoughts? Naturally three lines would add more load...

Thanks for any explanation!
