OK, hi [@rexagod](/profile/rexagod) - just skimmed this but actually I think there may need to be a lot more separation between the UI (say, drawing boxes, lines, things like that) and the underlying code that drives it. My question about `getPoints`, `findPointMatches` and the other methods was to look at what functions would be useful for general-purpose uses, without yet mixing in any display code. I want to know how you'd pass in 2 images, and how we'd format the identified points that were handed back out? How we'd "save" a point (in what format) that we want to reference again later? And how to (most importantly) return the location of a point in Image B but using the coordinate space of Image A. (i.e. what point in Image A does a given matched point in Image B correspond to?)

Finally, maybe as important as that last, can we return the four corner points of Image B in Image A's coordinate space? So that we can position Image B relative to Image A?

Does this make sense? These don't yet get into how the info would be displayed, and I think it's important to develop a strong set of function descriptors before actually writing any display code!
