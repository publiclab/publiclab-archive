Crap, I thought I posted this comment but didn't, late last night; hopefully still helpful:

I think forward error correction could be done on top of webjacks encoder and decoder, without dipping into the encoder and decoder themselves, no?

Like, make a new library that uses webjack, and just for-loops to send each thing three times? But has the same API as webjack, like send, etc. That might be architecturally much simpler. The new library could be included with webjack, and/or chained into the pipeline between webjacks public API and the encoder/decoder.

Then you'd have to write the same thing as an Arduino library, or an extension to the modded soft modem lib -- perhaps with a similar abstraction to the webjack implementation.
