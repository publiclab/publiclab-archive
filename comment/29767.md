Victoria Scott - 3/11/2022: My experience with collecting microplastics was not the setting I imagined. The area was completely covered with plants and the weather was very gloomy & cold, but the experience was very eye-opening. It made me realize just how much human activities such as littering can affect our wildlife and water systems. The items I saw most often included plastic bottles, cans, or paper bags. These items can cause microplastics to enter our filtration systems, our water systems, etc. Because of this, microplastics are capable of entering our bodily systems through foods and drinks. Yet, the most interesting item I observed was a twin size mattress lying on the ground near the shore of the river, because it made me wonder how it got there in the first place? It takes most plastics 450 years to disintegrate meanwhile it can take a mattress 80 to 120 years to decompose.
