I was able to get one of the nuts to sit firmly at the bottom, but the other two wouldn't.  My print might be a little messy there, I'm not sure. One thing that was helpful was screwing the nut a 1/2 turn onto one bolt to hold it in place and tightening the other bolt from the other side.  The tricky thing about that was how thin the nuts were.  

If there were thicker nut sizes (metric hardware is a little under-stocked in the US) this technique would be easier.
