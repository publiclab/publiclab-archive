[@stevie](/profile/stevie) I have implemented a **Sort by tags** Feature that will sort the question based on tags as ou can see here in this comment: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/628#issuecomment-238007862 of plots2 Pull request [#628](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/628). I will add up some lines below it explaining it. This will greatly help users to find specific questions based on tags. I will also add some of the documentation as you mentioned.
