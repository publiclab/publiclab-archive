Some more thoughts about time: managing it in a coherent way will be a major benefit of using the platform.  

As you probably know most Arduino boards and even the Raspberry Pi don't have a real time clock (which leads to hilarity when time stamping data entries off the grid). Internet connected systems can usually sync their clocks with a time server, but what about outages and off the grid local networks?  Maybe we can include an RTC with an RPi based kit or as an option.  

Especially in cases with remote reservoirs, we should be caching at least two timestamps: entering or leaving the pipe.  Another feature that I've (pipe) dreamed about is the ability to send timely (and back-dated) annotations into the flow using a mobile device browser interface - some sort of markdown would be sweet.  This want was inspired by experiments to manipulate the conditions of an indoor environment and the need to somehow document the crazy things we were trying so it could be correlated with the sensor time series.
