Page 50 also discusses filtering effects -- where the color of the sample itself (yellow, brown) can filter out some wavelengths of fluorescence. This can be seen [in this post](/notes/eustatic/08-01-2013/zapping-grand-isle-coffee-team-orca-and-the-green-laser) by [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic):

It suggests that "the fluorescence intensity must be multiplied by a correction factor (Valeur, 2001)."
