**Thank you to everyone who joined this call yesterday!**

A fabulous group of organizers and mappers came to the call and exchanged knowledge, questions, challenges, and guidance on the work they're doing in their communities. Notes from the call are here: https://pad.publiclab.org/p/opencall. 

The conversation can help direct additional focus as we review and create resources on the topic of mapping for organizing and advocacy. Iâ€™ll post some of the more general questions that came up so that we can start working on them!
