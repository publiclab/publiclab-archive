we don't have to frame the capabilities as a  large leaks vs. small leaks question, I think it will be more about lighting conditions.

The commercial gasfinder camera is based on FLIR's night vision systems for military planes, and is very sensitive in low-light conditions.  This makes it excellent for detecting the most dangerous kinds of leaks in plants-- indoor gas leaks.  I believe this is a significant aspect of its commercial appeal.

In our case, we're mostly interested in public exposure and fenceline issues.  Therefore we'll be mostly using a gasfinder camera outdoors in daylight. There are a couple orders of magnitude more MWIR outdoors, and so a much less sensitive instrument should be sufficient.
