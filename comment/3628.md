Dear Jan,
Thank you for your reply. It is good to know that I need to add an 
indicator. Now I need to figure out what is possibly in the water that 
would need indicating?! This is more complicated than I thought. Is there
a site you could recommend - such as  Water Pollution for Dummies.com :)
