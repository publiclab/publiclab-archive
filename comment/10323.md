Thanks for the question ichinarayan,

I exported the spectra in csv form into microsoft excel. From there I selected the wavelengths I wanted to study and subtracted the intensity of the sample from the intensity of the baseline, giving "absorbance". Simple then to plot the results on a scattergraph in excel.

hope this helps
