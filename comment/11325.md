Hi Wbugar. The units of the stl files are inches. I can convert them to metric if needed, but most components/parts around here primarily denoted in inches so I kept the stl files in the same units for convince. And yes, Edmund is a bit expensive, but they are the cheapest I could find that will provide a reproducible product. I messed around with some real cheap educational mirrors, but the variation in each mirror were so large you would have to make a unique mount for each one. I would love for someone to point me in the direction of some cheaper, quality optics. As far as mounting on a board, that's kinda how I started, but the hard part of the spectrometer is alignment, and when you have so many degrees of freedom it becomes a bit of a headache. The current design provides a good alignment if you use all the parts specified. I could see some kind of paper template you could print for aligning the pieces on a board. 

Thanks for the input. I think there are a lot of possibilities with this design, just have to find the time...
