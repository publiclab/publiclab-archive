On battery life- it wasn't very good.  
Mercury (as in mercury lamps) have a lot of lines that go all through the uv/vis spectrum. For a while(as in late 1970s), it was used as a source for hplc(high pressure liquid chromatography) uv/vis detectors. Trouble is, you have to filter out the ones that aren't needed.  And there are a lot.
