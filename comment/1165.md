How does it fly?

It looks very similar to some of the <a href="http://horvath.ch/en/kite_lab.html">Horvath</a> kites, especially the Urban Ninja.

The Urban Ninja is a very interesting kite. The plans are available for free on that site. You don't have to use the exact materials that he specifies. I made mine with Tyvek and wood and it flew well. Not as well as the Icarex and carbon fiber, I'm sure.
