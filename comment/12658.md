Thanks, Gwill -- good resource. 

Chris, I wanted to get some more clarity from [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) on the mercury oxidation states [in the comments of my post](http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-30-2015/new-wavelength-calibration-procedure-preview-for-spectral-workbench-2-0). Hopefully that'll answer some questions, but it seems like your suspected 8,000,000-intensity line is listed as Hg II. I also wonder if there could be a blend of different oxidation states... I really don't know the chemistry.
