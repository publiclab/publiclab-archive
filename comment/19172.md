Great Proposal [@souravirus](/profile/souravirus)  ! Learnt a lot from your proposal :) 

Just few things to add here : 

1.) Have you started looking for gems upgradation or alternatives as some gems from the list provided by you above will be used in the near future .  

2.) I remember during the time when we upgraded to rails 4.x , many routes did not worked because we did not had integration tests for routes . I thought this may help :P .

Thanks !
