We have the same problem: we bought a camera from Publiclab store (Drograce WP200) but we are not able to set it to continuous mode. Triggering the camera as [@liz](/profile/liz) suggests just makes one single photo.
In the instructions they don't say anything about continuos or timelapse mode (nor in the menu).
Ideas?
