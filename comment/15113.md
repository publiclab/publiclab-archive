Hi, Abdul - this looks great; do you imagine we could offer the spec both with/without the wood piece? I know some people have wanted more rigidity, [like in this prototype](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/04-21-2016/prototype-of-easy-to-build-rigid-spectrometer-housing). We could maybe separate out the basic kit from the various ways of getting more rigidity. 

Also, i think it'd be possible to include another piece of stiff paper that could be folded into a more rigid block for the webcam, without the overhang. One issue is when the cable is tugged, it can move the webcam if it's not super well secured. Just a thought!
