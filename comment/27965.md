Yes you're quite correct in an ideal world we would be using absorbance (Log of transmission) and subtracting a blank. There is also a problem with focusing in this experimental setup the sharpness of the spectrum will depend on the distance from the light source (is it optimised for infinity - I don't know).
And, as I have mentioned previously, it's no good trying to quantify stuff that is colourless.
Nitrogen fertiliser is either ammonium nitrate or urea both of which are colourless.
