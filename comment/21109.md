Thanks [@warren](/profile/warren) and [@roberts_ecofarm](/profile/roberts_ecofarm)! This information is really helpful, and gives a way forward. 
I will dig through my boxes of extra parts and find a potentiometer, maybe also a battery case for a 9v battery, then remake this circuit. I'll write in with how it goes.
