Thanks Nate for posting my thoughts.

I wanted to comment on Mathew's idea of calibrating the pump before shipment.  I assume what is meant is that a fixed restriction is attached to the pump to get the proper flow rate for the formaldehyde tube.  The problem with this idea appears to be in preparing the measuring tube.  When you score and break both ends of the tube the resulting two orifices will be different sizes each time this procedure is done.  They will be scored on a different point on the tapered glass seal.  Thus the flow restrictions from the tube will vary.  I do not know if it will add sufficient enough variation though.  Perhaps a way around this is some fixture to use so that a consistent diameter is scored thus resulting in a standard flow thru the tube.
