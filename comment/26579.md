UPDATED the Proposal
Updates:
1. Added Custom insert modules - Wikis, Notes, Nodes, Activity, Question, Inline Maps. Added mockups for both
2. Added table-border issue 
3. Changed the timeline 
4 Fixed Styling of toolbar issue ( https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/7534  )
5. Removed Using the center-alignment button in Markdown mode, Disabling of [#Markdown](/tag/Markdown) button, table popup issue. Will be fixing it before the GSoC period So that I give more time to priority issue during the GSoC period.
