Maybe you should try to do your extraction with some alcohol. Chlorophylls are, after all, lipophilic and you have to get them out of the chloroplast membranes.  Desinfectant alcohol is probably the safest, though if you work in a ventilated kitchen (under a hood) or outside you could use methanol of acetone from your local DIY store. It may clean up your baseline and enhance the vies of the chl b shoulder in your spectrum.
