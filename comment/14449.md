Awesome techniques! Is there any research on the guiding assumption that deer have an effect on the amount of carbon sequestered?

I would imagine that deer grazing on tree saplings would have a greater effect than deer grazing on grasses and bushes, which may tolerate it better, and might even benefit from a grow/graze cycle? (so that nutrients can return to the soil?)
