Sorry for the slow reply! I think my spam filter may have been hoarding emails from PL. 

The color changes from a waxy yellowish orange to pink and it is not the gradient of the color that matters but how far it goes along a long graduated marks like [@btbonval](/profile/btbonval) mentions. 

I don't know anything about color theory. What color background would make the distinction between yellowish orange and pink most dramatic? I think we may need a photo of the card and a close up of the tube. So that would be four photos total. 1 of the tube and its PL specific serial number from a smart phone to prove that it was un-opened at the time stamp. 1 of the pump on a non-formaldehyde emitting surface (top of the fridge is a good one). 1 of the card and the tube and 1 close up of the tube. Is that too much? 

I bought a cheap humidity gauge like the one attached to that thermometer and it has already crapped out. Mine was from petco and for reptile cages. 

Here is a list a preliminary list of the entry fields we need on the card (I tried to break it up to look like [@warren](/profile/warren) 's much better design):

A

* Date of test
* Test start time (We will probably want start times to be the same-ish, between 1:30pm and 3pm with a preference of 2pm)
* Test end time
* Tube serial number
* Read out on tube (PPM)
*  Zip code
* Temperature (F) 
* Humidity (can't perform test if under 10 or over 90)

B

* Housing Type: Manufactured, New (less than 5.5 years), Passive Green, Other _____
* My exterior windows and doors have been closed for 24 hours (this is for homogeneity control, easier than having them document each open window/door which would be the other option) (yes/no check box)
* My HVAC system has been blowing air  ___% of the time during this test 

C

* Other observations (much blank space)
