This is fantastic!  

- I love the idea of using CO2 and/or RH as a metric for sleep quality / breathing patterns.  I suppose you're getting a much stronger signal in your tent than you would in an open room?  But seems worth a shot!

- Interesting to see the apparent correlations in temp, CO2, and RH, and what that might say about e.g. Craig health / mushroom health / the nature of the enclosure.  I wonder if the cross-correlation time of each of these variables against the other could be used as a metric for e.g. how much air is circulating around the sensor, or how 'closed' a 'grow box system' is ...

- Could we use the CO2 sensor, in a closed container, plus infragram, as a way of correlating plant respiration w/ photosynthetic activity?

- How much are the parts in all of this, again?  It's looking like it'd make for a neat little kit!

- Can't wait to see this applied to mushrooms!
