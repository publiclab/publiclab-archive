**
Green Area [#1:](/n/1:)  **Pinney Hollow Formation - phyllite member.  
Age: Neoproterozoic - Cambrian (1000 - 485.4 Ma).  
Description: Light-greenish-gray to lustrous pale-green chlorite-muscovite-quartz (±chloritoid±garnet±magnetite) phyllite. Unit is locally albitic and contains minor beds of quartzite. Cover rocks of Green Mountain anticlinorium.
Lithology: Major:{phyllite}

**Green Area [#2:](/n/2:) ** Ottauquechee Formation - carbonaceous albite schist member  (plus a bunch of other stuff)
Age: Cambrian (541 - 485.4 Ma).  
Description: Tan- to dark-gray-weathering, carbonaceous, medium- to coarse-grained chlorite-plagioclase-muscovite-quartz schist and interbedded tan, gray, and bluish-gray quartzite. Rocks of the Rowe-Hawley Zone. Allochthonous cover sequence east of the Green Mountains: rift and drift stage metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks and tectonic inclusions of ultramafic rocks.
Lithology: Major:{muscovite schist}, Minor:{quartzite}

**Gray Area (interspersed): ** Meta-ultramafic rocks - undifferentiated
Age: Neoproterozoic - Cambrian (1000 - 485.4 Ma)  
Description: Brown to white-weathering, green, massive, moderately to fully serpentinized dunite and peridotite and schistose serpentinite; rusty-weathering, medium-grained talc-carbonate rock and quartz-carbonate
Lithology: Major:{metadunite,metaperidotite,serpentinite}, Minor:{calc silicate rock,metacarbonate}

###What I want to do

Serpentine is often associated with chrysotile, which is used to make asbestos, and further north near Belvidere Mountain there are plentiful outcrops of crysotile that were previously mined for asbestos.  Beautiful and deadly!  We spent a good part of the weekend trying to determine safety concerns around handling serpentine.

###My attempt and results

Below is an example of serpentine, pictured next to a larger piece of phyllite from the waterfall hike.  I don't think the white overlays are chrysotile, but it seems entirely possible that it's interspersed.  The big seam running through the top rock is likely magnesite, a magnesium carbonate, not quartz as we originally thought.

The seam in the larger rock (I believe it's phyllite, picked up near the waterfall) likely *is* quartz.  It is a very large example of crystalline silica, and is pretty much everywhere along these trails.  Serpentine is located only in the quarry area; there were no examples that we found along the waterfall walk, which is consistent with the map. 

Here's a better example of magnetite on serpentine from the same quarry, taken earlier this year  (I'll try to dig up and post a better picture of my rock once I unpack the car):

Back to asbestos.  Here's a close-up of one of my rocks.  Fibrous, but not fuzzy.  

I don't think it's chrysotile, but maybe related?

###Questions and next steps

Comparing the magnetite (in serpentine) and quartz (in phyllite) you can really get a sense of how multiple formations interact in similar ways, with cooling seams forming similar-looking crystal structures in very different types of rock (carbonate vs. silica).  Similar structures, very different kinds of rock.  

Phyllite seems like it's pretty much ubiquitous, both in the Moosamaloo and Pinney Hill Formations and elsewhere.  The ultramafic outcropping basically just in this one spot where the quarry is located.

###Why I'm interested

I like rocks and minerals.  Also I'm a teacher and my kiddos love geology.
