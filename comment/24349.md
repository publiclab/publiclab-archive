 You could get a local lab to test for metals using atomic absorption or atomic emission.  You would have to look up the best technique for the metals you are interested in.  Anyway, you would do an extraction of a soil sample with nitric acid and get the lab to do the analysis.  If you talk to someone at your local university chemistry department you might be able to get them to have a student do it in the fall semester as a project.
Poly-cyclic aromatics you could probably do a qualitative test for using uv spectroscopy.  Extract the organics with something like hexane, evaporate it to a known volume and record the spectrum.  This is something that your local college will definitely be able to do.
