Public Lab promoted dual-camera IR systems more than three years ago before they found that the one camera systems worked well enough to get people started collecting plant health photos. So there is a lot of information at this site about dual-camera NDVI systems ([e.g., this note](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-28-2014/the-titan-2-rig)).  There is also lots of information about [pure NIR photos.](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/05-09-2013/invisible-light)

Glass IR pass filters can be used if the camera allows attaching them in front of the lens (the internal IR block filter has to be removed first). Some PowerShots allow attaching a filter tube, and such [cameras have been used in dual-camera IR rigs](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/06-22-2014/titan-2-ir). The cut-off wavelength to use can be anywhere from 700 to 950 nm, but somewhere around 700-750 nm seems to be a good compromise. Good quality filters can cost $100, but it is now possible to find glass IR filters for under $20.

Polyester long pass filters are also available in standard photographic types. The Wratten 87 filter is sold as a 3 inch square of polyester by Lee Filters, and can be found for under $20. The cut-off in the Wratten 87 is at about 720 nm. A little piece of this can replace the IR block filter inside the camera [as in this rig](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/08-08-2014/titan-2-ir-flight).  Small pieces of filter are [available here.](http://fastie.net/product/wratten87/)

In general, a dual-camera system will produce better NDVI results than a single-camera system because it produces both an NIR photo and visible light photo that are not cross contaminated (e.g., no red in the NIR photo). Dual-camera systems also produce normal color photos of the scene which is really nice. Having all four bands to work with (RGB and NIR) allows good false color IR images to be produced, and these are traditionally important for vegetation remote sensing.

Ned Horning's Fiji plugin was designed for manipulating the photos from dual-camera systems and makes that job easy even for directories full of matched VIS/NIR photos.

For aerial photos when the cameras are moving, the shutters must be triggered on both cameras simultaneously. This is straightforward with PowerShots, but I don't know how to do that with Mobius cameras.
