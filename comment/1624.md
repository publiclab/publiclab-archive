Thanks for the reply...
The carbon electrodes I am using are the uncoated plain Jane's as it were and 1/4"(6 mm) diameter.
The density to me really at this does not mean much, but it is interesting that the old schooler rods were less dense.
My power supply that i have worked up is a DC system... As DC offers up a ay more stable Arc. My main voltage is 120 AC and I control both legs by way of a Relay. The out put from the relay is than rectified to DC thru a FWBR and the voltage is smoothed by a 1700 mF - 450 volt Cap. I also included a Dual heating coil (Ballast) that are switchable so to reduce the resistance by 50% +/- resistance to have a Hi power or Lower power service to the CA.
 All the circuitry is house in a stand alone enclosure, other than the supply from the mains. I incorporated a Duplex plug to allow the end user to plug in the CA device power supply to reduce the foot print at the work station.
I look at the Horizontal electrode with a Ceramic boat on a race drive to put the sample into the arc and decide to go with the vertical format instead. 
The Cathode rod will be bored to create a pocket as it were for the sample that will be tested. As I referenced in the video the test should only need to ran for 15 seconds to acquire the spectra. As far as reusing the carbons they can be burn to clear them of the old sample and then re-bore to accept the new sample to be tested.
I plan on working the housing for the carbon arc fixture tomorrow and will install a filtered view port via # 12 welding lens so the operator can observe the process. and adjust the arc gap if needed. 
There will be a procedure to setup the CA to center the Arc to the optical axis of the spectrometer and a aliment can be during that time.

Anyway I am rambling again so I'll stop for now

Cheers Bill
