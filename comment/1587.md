Jeff, I'm glad you like the music. Maybe we can have a sing-a-long in Cocodrie.  The last two weeks of rain has popped up mushrooms everywhere around here, so there are lots of missed opportunities now. But LEAFFEST was not one of them because had it been either of the two subsequent weekends we would have been very wet and grounded. I'm pleased that you think I have a future as a post card photographer.  The most remarkable thing about yesterday's Bread Loaf photos is that they were captured during a four hour window which was the only acceptable KAP weather for ten days, and it happened to be the peak of the colors.

Congrats on 110k!
