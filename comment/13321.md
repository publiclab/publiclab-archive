That's super, thanks. I think we're pretty close here, but I just wanted to get explicit confirmation that the process I outlined is accurate for how you derived the correction -- mainly in the interest of reproducibility. Did the code I posted make sense, and does it accurately describe your process?

Thanks, Dave -- i'm also VERY close to posting the new Snapshots and Operations systems, which I hope to very soon follow up on with this correction code.
