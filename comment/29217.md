We are relying on odor as the main indicator. VOCs are prevalent in landfill odors and have a sweet smell; hydrogen sulfide is also prevalent and has a rotten egg smell. If the odor is above 65% of what we normally experience during a typical odor event, we will pull a grab sample. 

(We are using 5L Tedlar bags from SKC and the Public Lab Bucket Air Sampling kit).
