Thanks; good comments.

1 - Dilution: I updated the note to clarify that the larger signals were only attenuated to better match the range of the weaker signatures so there was no dilution. I did so to eliminate the dilution variable as a factor in that analysis and plot.

2 - Simple relationship: Yes, that was not very clear. I updated the conclusions to better clarify my thoughts. Yes, there is a rough correlation in that "lighter" oils tend to have fewer large PAH molecules so the curves tend to shift toward the UV and get more narrow -- but this correlation is not sufficient to describe the range of oils.

3 - Opacity: Actually, that is a good suggestion for a test using my dilutions and the Solux source (not quite sure how I'll prototype that...). I also added a comment suggesting that perhaps the oils can behave like high-pass filters which change with dilution or maybe there's some factor related to EVO and dilution though I'd guess that is reaching a bit. Yes, when clear 1:1 correlation (which are not affected by other variables) are found, there is often a way to compensate. The trick is often the other variables.
