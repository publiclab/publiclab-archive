The recommended limit of pfoa + pfos is 70 parts per trillion (!).  That's recommended, it's not enforced.

The method of analysis is by LC/MS/MS.  This is a very expensive technique. 

The $275 sounds about right, unless you can find some program where an agency will pay part of the water analysis bill. 

Good luck.
