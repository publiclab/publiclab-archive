[@Claytonb](/profile/Claytonb) - I am planning to start with a single camera and do some initial testing and learning before I go over to two cameras.

Yes the focusing can be improved but it might not be so important as we are not planning in zooming so much.

This is funny because I dont really get the whole process in my mind yet. If we use a red filter then it will pass visible RED light and NIR. In your first picture under the comments the grass looks blue. How come the blue channel is registering NIR and why not for example a green channel registering it instead. Is the filter changing the wavelength of NIR to visible blue ?
