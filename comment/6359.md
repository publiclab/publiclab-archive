Jeff, Galen is not aware that he has your photos. Did he put them on his netbook?

Charlie, I am looking at a few of the high elevation RGB photos of the cove and trying to stitch them in Photoshop. I think it requires a few steps because I can't see the lawn furniture in the highest photos. I will post a research note when I get the process figured out.

I will try to make a torrent to share the aerial images, but there are a lot and most people who don't already have them probably won't want them all. However, I added the GPS coordinates of the bottom end of the balloon tether to each of the 1600 jpeg files (VIS and NIR). The GPSr was always with me, so when I (on shore or in the canoe) am in the photo, my lat/lon is in the photo header and I become another ground control point. But sharing snapshots would be great. Maybe put them at Flickr with the tag H2ONUTZ? Who wants to hound everyone to do that?
