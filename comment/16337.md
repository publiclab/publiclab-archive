Hi, I'm happy to meet with you perhaps on Monday -- what times are you free? And as to the scripts, I think starting with a hard-coded one is a good place to begin, but I also think that posting one of each would help people understand the pros and cons of an NLP-based approach, by contrast to a hard-coded script. I'm not asking you necessarily to post a complete interaction as it'll be coded, but to illustrate a few initial options to help people understand what your bots could do, by example. Thanks!
