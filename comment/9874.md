Ah, yes, exactly  -- by 'activated' above I meant to indicate: "research note author edits the note, and clicks the 'link to github repo' or 'refresh' button underneath the 'github repo URL' text field.  There could be a checkbox for 'refresh whenever remote repo changes', and etc.'  

If we'd be avoiding iframes, the only other modifications on the publiclab.org side necessary (in addition to this 'link to github repo' button idea) might be: inclusion of mathjax script on the rendering page (for the LaTeX equations) and making sure that the code block formatting works the same way (there seems to be some issue with the 'back tick' syntax?)
