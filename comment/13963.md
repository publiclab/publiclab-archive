Hi Chris, thank you for the support. I tried to install on my Mac Fiji/Image J (I suppose your image is obtained with Fiji) but when I installed (Plugins -> Install --> Photo Monitoring.jar or fiji-nojre-20141125_PM.zip as selected files) Photo monitoring plugin I received these errors: 

/Applications/Fiji 2.app/plugins/Photo_Monitoring.jar: java.util.zip.ZipException: error in opening zip file

/Applications/Fiji 2.app/plugins/fiji-nojre-20141125_PM.zip: java.util.zip.ZipException: error in opening zip file

and if I restart Fiji in the plugin list I have not Photo monitoring plugin.

There is something wrong?
I found an ImageJ version with Photo Monitoring included. If I select the Photo monitor plugin, I click on the voice Dual Image NDVI Processing, you can see a screen capture of the window,

I can select only 1 image, it appears the window of the output directory and log file. It appears a small windows as in the figure

I haven't any NDVI image on the output directory. Why?
Thanks.
