This is a great write-up on this activity. As [@warren](/profile/warren) mentioned I did this activity at MakerFaire with a very broad age range 6-60. Because I was brand new to Coqui, and the new tiny breadboards were different than those used in the original write-up, [@warren](/profile/warren) helped me to figure out new wiring that would work. Since our booklets no longer matched the new wiring, I made a Fritzing diagram to make things easier to understand. These diagrams became like little placemats at the table (we taped them down so they wouldn't walk :D). Anyway, with parts in cups in the middle of the table, it became very easy to get this activity to work in about an hour. I only did handholding for first placing the timer to make sure that it was positioned properly, and from then on all the kids were able to do the wiring themselves. These boards are tiny and the positions are very difficult to read for older people or children with vision issues. Anyway, I'm happy to say that out of about 60 people or so that did this activity, only 2 had issues, but I'm sure they figured it out once they got home. We did a quick test simply using two wires taped together as a probe in two solutions of water--one from a drinking fountain and one from a bottle of spring water. It was great to hear the two different tones and kids were excited to take it back home to test their own water.
