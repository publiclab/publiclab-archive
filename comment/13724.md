Hello Matej! Those "humps" that you are getting from the daylight bulbs are the very reason I don't use them, that continuous band on the blue spectrum gives poor calibration, it's thru trial and error that I found that out and working with Dave Stoft on getting my spectrometer working right.

I found the 23W softer light bulb (which equates to a 100W bulb as far as lumens,) has well defined vertical bands that are easier to calibrate, no matter what width of slit you are working with, I have found that the narrower slit size gives more resolution and a better "quality fit" on calibrating.
