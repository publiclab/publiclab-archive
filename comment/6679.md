Have you attempted to do dual-camera red/IR photos? Or even just a regular visible-light photograph of the same worm to get the red channel?

What do you do with the worms (i'm almost afraid to ask) when you find them? 

Another thought -- if we ever get around to doing [hyperspectral imaging](/tag/hyperspectral) with the smartphone specs, we could try to resolve a "heatmap" of the worms. I was thinking that something like Infragrammar would allow us to select specific wavelengths to generate use-specific images from a hyperspectral scan.
