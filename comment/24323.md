 Hi [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano) this is great! 

on 3: This is a really helpful idea. I hadn't thought of a place where people could carry on updates and conversations as the review is going on. Maybe the talk pad for the review area would be a spot to do this, but it's not something you'd be notified about if someone updated it, so I think  it could be a little lonely to follow there. [@warren](/profile/warren) do you have ideas on where the conversations could happen on this in a similar sort of thread? Maybe with each Review we post an "updates" research note people can just reply to and comment in on (much like this?!)

4- Mentioning the right people is good advice too. Right now I don't know how we would track when people did the different steps. Maybe there's a "Done" moment or an "I did this" opportunity we could capture in some way. That way we would know who has done what and who we could credit with helping out!
