To converting the image to spectrum we are using our own developed software for android devices, the software actually is free. We developed a miniaturized low-cost spectrometer that uses the camera of an Android Smatphone and processes the images in our spectrometry software (Android App). The Android App enables initial wavelength calibration, which allows calibrating the device and obtaining values of absorbance and transmittance, and to obtain spectral curves in real-time To obtain the software, the tutorial for assembling the mini-spectrometer, the tutorial for lambda calibration (wavelength) please visit our web page (UniversidadPrivada Boliviana): http://www.upb.edu/en/contenido/smartphone-spectrometer For any questions: oormachea@upb.edu or avillazon@upb.edu To converting the image to spectrum we are using our own developed software for android devices, the software actually is free.
