Dear Ned, 
              Oh okay i think i got your idea of calibration. I wanted to know the settings (white balance)  which you apply normally when collecting the data from the field. I will have a look to Chris research notes to get the better idea of calibrating using white balance. Similarly, do you have any idea about the spectral response of the mobius action camera? If you dont have that information, could you tell me how i can extract that information on spectral response of the camera.

Thank you for your suggestion on reporting back to public labs. I will definately start reporting once i get some outputs, even if it doesn't work as hoped. My main objective for this research is to monitor the crop health( banana farm) by attaching mobius to the drone and flying on an area of 100 acres. My process involves stiching multiple mobius images (~100 images taken at height of 200m from ground) and creating an orthomosaic from which i calculate the NDVI. Furthermore, i have recently bought image stabilizing gimbal specially designed for mobius action camera (picture attached) which is expected to get rid of any jello effect and vibration. I will probably run test flight with that gimbal  after i finish my exam (around 2nd week of June) and will definately post my results.

Best Regards, 
Suman
