A carnivore is an animal that eats meat. 
The biosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere.  
Omnivore is an organism that eats foods like plants and animals. Ex: humans 
The three levels are producers, consumers, and decomposers.  
Biomes are large ecological areas with similar conditions, such as vegetation, living organisms, soil, and climate. 
It is a danger for the Burmese python to adapt to the southern state's biomes because it is invasive species could make living hard for many organisms. They could thrive more in the southern areas because of the temperatures of the water is like what their native land is like. Has become the most destructive invasive species. There is a fear of the growth of the Burmese python because invasive species cause most of the animal population to go instinct.  Out of the males and female python the largest are females. A normal python in it native habit would reproduce up to 40 eggs but since introduce into the new habit they reproduce 2 as much since they are being hunted. Since the dicovery of the python in the sourthern areas agencies have since opened that will pay to catch a python and bring it to them.
