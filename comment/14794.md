[@stoft](/profile/stoft) Hey dave, I just wanted to shoot ya a quick reference on a comparison I did do using data from the Oregon Medical Laser Center, the sample was Rhodamine B in Ethanol, I superimposed my spectral plot of rhodamine b ( I used the high speed cmos camera for this one,) on the OMLC's plot so spekwin32 program wouldn't stretch the data.
