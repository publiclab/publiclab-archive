The MiniVol is a few thousand dollars, i think used: https://publiclab.org/minivol but the samples cost a good bit to process (see page)

And the ThermoFisher PDR-1500 is (used) I think ~$1500 -- https://publiclab.org/wiki/pdr-1500

Public Lab has one of each of these, and we're interested in loaning them out, but I don't know that we yet have a huge amount of information about how well they meet specific needs, or in-depth information about what kind of uses their data can be put towards. But please ask questions on those pages to help unpack these devices and what they can do for us!
