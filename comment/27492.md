Hi Petter
Thaks a lot for your comment, glad to have followed a similar approach as you did! Of course I also checked our post on this topic [Link](https://publiclab.org/notes/petter_mansson1/04-09-2019/low-cost-ndvi-analysis-using-raspberrypi-and-pinoir) and I already had a look at your GitHub repo some weeks ago. My target is to also have everything neatly in python or R (which I am a bit more familiar with). 

a) What were your findings running this analysis within your setup? 
b) Did you have a closer look at the color histograms at your end? 
c) Did you evaluate each pixel value > 0 in a more automated way with Python?

Best, 
Patrick
