[@mathew](/profile/mathew) wrote a great overview of lots of different ways that different projects/sensors measure particulates: http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/05-05-2015/evaluating-low-cost-optical-dust-sensors

I think the long and short of it is that if the datasheet doesn't specify, you may have to open it up like Willie Shubert did: http://publiclab.org/notes/Willie/04-01-2014/field-testing-the-shenyei-pm-sensor

And I've been working with [@mathew](/profile/mathew) on running a whole batch of them at the same time, to compare: http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/06-01-2015/plan-for-recording-shinyei-optical-sensors-using-open-pipe-kit 

so it'd be great to try to write a matching [Open Pipe Kit](/wiki/open-pipe-kit) driver for that sensor too! How much does it cost?
