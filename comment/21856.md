 Hi Chris,
Many thanks. I managed to get a DB660/850 filter and should have my camera (Olympus E-M10 Mark II) converted this week. It did cost an arm and a leg, but I hope it will be worth it :)

We are running a drought experiment, and my goal is to see whether the converted camera can detect sings of (progressing) plant stress. The experiment will take several weeks and will take place in a glasshouse (under natural light, though mostly diffuse), meaning that I will need to compare images taken on different days, with different light conditions. The (ambitious) goal is to analyse the changes in NDVI in the studied plants during the experiment.

I'm well aware of the numerous issues with single-image NDVI estimation; however, I'm still not sure how to tackle them. I will be saving all images in RAW and have worked on a simple Matlab code to pre- and post-process the images for NDVI analysis. This will hopefully let me fix some of the mistakes (e.g. incorrect white balance) in image processing, but if the mistakes can be avoided, I would rather not make them in the first place.

My main concerns are:
1. White balance - the DB660/850 filter is relatively new and I haven't found any recommendations for white balance settings (particularly for NDVI). More importantnly, I'm not sure whether it's better to set a new custom white balance each day (e.g. on a grey/blue/red card in shade or grass) or keep using the custom white balance selected on Day 1 of the experiment, regardless of the changing light. I'm leaning towards the first option, as the second can be later implemented in image processing, if needed.

2. Spectral sensitivity of red and blue channels and the 'contamination' of the VIS channel (in my case, red) with NIR - I've read Ned Horning's great articles about calibration, but I must say the camera calibration for NDVI is still rocket science to me.

Any advice is most welcome.
