How big are the particles?   I know very little about microplastics but I found this great reference sheet:  http://www.ccb.se/documents/Postkod2017/Mtg050317/Guide%20to%20Microplastic%20Identification_MERI.pdf.   Most of the samples here would I think be visible at 40x magnification.  In some cases, it looks like that might actually be too much.
