Yes, any battery pack will work. The SkyShield has an LDO voltage regulator that can take an input from battery up to 17 volts. So it's easy to find a power source that works. To make it easy for the largest number of users, I wanted alkaline batteries to be the default power source. That way the product can be distributed with a battery holder and the user can supply the batteries. Including a lithium battery and charger would probably double the cost of the SkyShield kit.
