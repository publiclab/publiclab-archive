Does the very short distance between the camera and the slit cause problems?
I found the glue on the webcam lens very difficult to deal with, so I did not try to focus the lens at the distance for the VHS box. I tried inserting a lens between the slit and the camera, but found that I had better resolution without the "focusing/collimating lens".  I am at a loss to being able to understand this.  Maybe my lens was causing other effects like reflections at the lens surfaces that caused problems.
