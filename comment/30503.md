The Burmese python is a type of snake that originates from the forest of New Delhi, India. The snake loves warm temperatures, forest, and especially swampy biomes. These snakes have been known to grow up to 23 feet and lay clusters of 12-48 eggs. They are apex predators at the top of their food chain not only in India but in Florida as well, the only difference is, the python’s home is in India, while in Florida they’re an invasive species.  The Burmese pythons have taken over the Florida Everglades and have become the top predator there as well-overtaking the alligators. This is disastrous because they are destroying the habitat and decreasing the population and diversity of the animals that live in the everglades. This is because Florida- on of the southern states as similar conditions like India.
