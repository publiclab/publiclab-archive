Another rather important topic is the strict altitude limitations for kites and balloons in the UK. Kites are not allowed to be more than 60m above the ground. Special permission is required for higher flights. Balloons might be allowed higher than kites but decorations are required. 

From: http://www.thekitesociety.org.uk/KiteRules.htm

Rule 53 Captive Balloons and Kites by Day  
53. (1) A captive balloon flying by day at a height exceeding 60 metres above the surface shall have attached to its mooring cable tubular streamers which are  
(a) not less than 40 centimetres in diameter and 2 metres in length; and  
(b) marked with alternate bands of red and white 50 centimetres wide at intervals of not more than 200 metres measured from the basket or, if there is no basket, from the lowest part of the balloon.

This might save you some money on kite line.
