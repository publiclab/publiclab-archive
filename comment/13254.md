Jeff - Yes, it may be possible (with some modifications) to use your new feature code for a 'default' gain correction. Also recall my later research note dealing more specifically with using the Solux 4700K lamp for calibration:
https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/03-06-2015/plab-3-gain-correction

However, remember that correcting the camera sensitivity (gain) vs spectral wavelength is a multiplicative process, not a subtractive process as is used when comparing two measurements with a device where the gain remains the same. To correct the camera sensitivity, the raw camera data is multiplied by the Solux correction data and then scaled for plotting. Also remember that although the correction data spans 300-800nm, the actual usable range of corrected data from the camera is only 400-650nm because the camera sensitivity errors dramatically increase at each end where the camera becomes totally insensitive. But, perhaps you could re-use most of your code for processing curve data and just add implementation for correction by adding buried (non-visible) correction curve data and re-scaling (in the case of corrected spectral data exceeding 100%).

The Solux spectral data can be found here: 
http://solux.net/ies_files/SoLux%20Spectral%20Data.xls.pdf 
You will note that only the 4700K lamp has an emission curve which is sufficiently smooth and broadband enough for the spectrometer gain connection.

I can email you the Solux and PLab correction data; it is not data directly suitable for display in SWB.
