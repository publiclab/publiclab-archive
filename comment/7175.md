Another thing to note is that the purple line is way out in the infrared (far enough that we know this despite the miscalibration) and NIST data we've imported spans only up to ~700nm (for example: https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/10864). I believe true NIST data goes higher (the gov shutdown has shuttered their site) but that the way we're doing the imports (via WebMineral.com) is just not displaying those higher lines.
