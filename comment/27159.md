Hi [@a1ahna](/profile/a1ahna),

Thank you for your suggestions! Since reading your post, I've begun to look into Spectral Python and it seems like it could be of great value. Seeing as there is so much documentation for me to go through, I was wondering if you might be able to lead me towards which functions in SPy might be of the most importance for my purposes.

I am glad to hear that I am not the only one with NDVI values hovering around 0 for all my images! Is emphasizing variation in NDVI values something that SPy can do? Or did you use other resources to do so? Since my post, I've begun normalizing my grayscale NDVI images, and then producing a colour map with the cfastie LUT. This exaggerates the NDVI values, but perhaps your method may work better.

For example, here is the normalized version of the grayscale image in my original post:
[![gray_normal.png](/i/40177)](/i/40177?s=o)

And here is the NDVI image with a colour map that the normalized grayscale produces:
[![ndvi_normal.png](/i/40178)](/i/40178?s=o)
