 Hey Isha, great proposal! Although [@warren](/profile/warren) covered all points, I will just add about the testing/feedback part, don't you think Aug 6 - Aug 10 is somewhat lesser time to test the project of such extent and that too in the end phase?

Also, I liked that you added about creating FTOs in the end phase of project. I will say, you should do that more frequently so that you can engage more new contributors in your project.

Nice designs and details overall!

Thanks!
