Yes, as [@stoft](/profile/stoft) mentions, an absolute intensity calibration is not required for demonstrating the Beer Lambert law; [@mathew](/profile/mathew) refers to a post about getting closer to absolute intensity calibration, which is one way to enable comparison between different devices (say, with different sensors). But that's not needed here. 

[@stoft](/profile/stoft), I'm curious, did you mean attenuation and concentration? I see there are ways to use wavelength with Beer-Lambert, but the main relationship is that attenuation and concentration of the sample are linearly related. But curious if there are other aspects or applications of the law I'm not familiar with. 

But yes, I think [@stoft](/profile/stoft) is also right that choosing your own stable light source, and not room lighting, is a good way to control light in your scans, and that using a full-spectrum source like a halogen or incandescent will let you measure a larger set of wavelengths.
