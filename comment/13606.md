Threaded lamp pipe comes in zinc plated steel, but I don't think we will find stainless. Here are two bulk suppliers of nipples:

A 1 1/2 inch long nipple costs $0.15.

Another problem is that the threads are non-standard (27 threads/inch) so you probably have to use the skinny nuts made for lamps. Standard 3/8" nuts can be 16, 24, or 32 threads/inch. 

The thicker lamp nuts are $0.05 apiece:
