Hi Chris,

Thanks for your quick response.

I am little confusing with the NIR light bandwidth because of NIR light's band width is 700 to 900 nm and blue light's band width is the 450 to 495 nm.so can we say like these NIR band is super impose on the blue and green band or NIR light is available on visible light band width.

Query,
1) How i am get NIR light in blue light's band if both light's wave length is different ? 

Regards,
