I wonder how reliable these test strips are for lead; I've heard that some of the less expensive colorimetric techniques like this are pretty unreliable when assessing arsenic and mercury levels.  Then again, even if this method isn't great at providing absolute concentrations, it might still work well as e.g. a binary indicator ('some of contaminant X is present' or  'there is no contaminant X present') ...
