Yeah I was thinking the same with the paint, introduces another source for pollutants. 

When I called the Dylos folks, they said that the device will not break at temperatures below 32 Fahrenheit, but it will become increasingly inaccurate, so they recommended shooting for 40 degrees Fahrenheit to be safe.
