We've been trying to use DIY microscopes to distinguish between crystalline and non-crystalline particulate matter. Of course we wouldn't be able to identify the composition of the PM with a microscope. However, we're thinking that being able to identify jagged primary particles from other PM near industrial frac sand mines could demonstrate the likelihood of respirable crystalline silica there. Do you think there are images in the book that would held distinguish crystalline silica (namely quartz, but also cristobalite and tridymite) from other crustal PM that might be found in a rural farming area?
