The base plate was made a separate piece for exactly that reason. It shouldn't be too hard to design a variety of them for different applications; a webcam or DSLR for instance.

Changing the default grating/camera angle would be pretty easy to do. Just let me know what angle you want use.

I can change the tripod point to a recessed nut. I went the route I did because I'm not sure there is room for a regular tripod plate to mount there unless it is flush with the case. For example, my smallest tripod plate is about as wide as an iPhone. If you plan to use one of those smaller smartphone tripods then it wouldn't be a problem. I will check with the molders and see how much trouble it would be to add the hole.
