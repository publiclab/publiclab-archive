We have an [NGB filter](http://www.event38.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=NGB2) installed in the camera to create color IR photos. I didn't touch the white balance settings on the camera, so I assume default? I will check next time. 

I did no post-processing, not even to cut out the tubing. I imagine it lowered the quality of the stitching a bit but I really wanted to post about the success of the rig moreso than the quality of the photos. With better conditions, I hope to get a very high quality product. 

The camera is taking photos every 2 seconds. I think I'm going to use setting 3 (9x5~) anyways for more photos = more overlap between photos. 

(I think I am taking off my glove while on the phone with my boss? At this point we were beginning to reel back in after a scare with a low-flying Cessna)

One thing about these flights is the in higher winds, it can be difficult to bring the kite back in. We've talked about getting a reel that sticks in the ground or other methods of automatically reeling in.
