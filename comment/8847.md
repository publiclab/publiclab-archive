Follow-up -- there's some nice info on IR photodiodes (at least the sort that are in a typical IR remote), [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10266) -- including a link to a [datasheet](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Infrared/tsop382.pdf).  Looks like those little guys are nicely designed so as not to be influenced by spurious pulses of light in the environment ... so maybe using the relatively simple (?) NIR photodiodes that are currently on the OpenLux for particle detection wouldn't work so well.  That said, we could put the photodiodes and emitters on a breakout board.  But it'd probably be hard to put that together, with lens and all, for less than the $2 that the [Syhitech DSM501A](http://publiclab.org/notes/chrisbartley/04-15-2014/speck-particle-monitor) is being sold for ...
