There is an article in "Aeolian Research", Dec. 2014, entitled "The size distribution of desert dust aerosols and its impact on the Earth system."

Caveat from article:
"Thus, size is a key determinant of mineral aerosol impacts. However, the size distribution of dust is poorly understood and difficult to consistently measure (e.g. Reid et al., 2003b)."

Despite the Earth-sized scale, the article has a lot on  comparing math modelings of dust distribution w. relation to size and wind speed. I didn't notice anything clarifying the viscosity, but I'll copy your notes to an atmospheric chemist I know.
It's CCL, and 3mb in size, with an extensive bibliography, mostly geophysics
