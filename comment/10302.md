Great, thanks Don. I can change the title/body to reflect whatever name you think is more appropriate -- "Coqui-based water conductivity sensor"?

I forgor to mentinon that this test made it really clear to me that you have to dip the probes *all the way in* to get a consistent tone -- making me want to put a 'water line' mark on the probe stick. Probes partially submerged or even submerged in bubbly water didn't generate a clear tone. 

We didn't have a thermometer on hand, but left the water at room temperature for over 30 minutes, and finger-dipped to check the temperature difference. Finger-dipping, while a time-honored accessible method from the caveman days, should be tested itself -- if we want to make a simple kit, what's an acceptable temperature difference between two glasses, and does a finger-dip get you in that range?
