Hello Chirs.
I used a glass filter indeed. They where arround 24 euro.
I will use a 3DR Pixhawk to trigger the cameras. The cams do not have gps them self. 
Will inject gps info in the picures, gps comes form Pixhawk.
I will try the 750 mm see how that will go and also your idea about shutter speed.
Will post the modification i'm making to spuoort dual cam in my bixler 2.
Thanks for the info
Grayson.
