Hi [@nnole](/profile/nnole)! Can you specify a little bit more your question? There are different answers depending, first of all, on the spectrometer you are using so, wich spectrometer are you using or you want to use? </br>
You can try the foldable spectrometer with almost every camera. I've tried to use it with my phone cameras with  awesome results and recently I've put it in the front of a 35mm Elmarit lens hooked to a D700 nikon. Great results.  </br>
Using reflex cameras you will depend a lot on the focusing distance of the lens you use.</br>
