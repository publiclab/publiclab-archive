The data can show you which parts of which plants are photosynthesizing most vigorously. Other factors being equal, this information could alert you to a situation such as your fertilizer or light not reaching all your plants evenly. 
Here are a couple activities for working with infrared data:

* https://publiclab.org/notes/LaPa/03-31-2016/raspberry-noir-cam-sensors-to-detect-water-stress-of-the-plants-during-their-growing
* https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/05-23-2016/graze-anatomy
* https://publiclab.org/map/fort-mason-community-garden-ndvi-false-color-san-francisco-california/2013-05-04-0 for large scale example


Note: NDVI might not reveal pests! https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/08-18-2013/hornworms
