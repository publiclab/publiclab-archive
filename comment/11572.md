Might be helpful to post the topic in the PLab Spectrometer Google groups where you can get a wide range of feedback. Briefly, I'm not clearly following your intent but it seems you want to measure / reference the solar spectrum so as to remove that variable from the image measurements. I'm guessing you are wanting to color-balance your aerial photos taken in sunlight which can be difficult depending on the degree of accuracy. In theory, if you could measure the general solar spectrum curve (as it relates to the deg-K change during the day as measured on the ground you are photographing, then you might apply an idealized deg-K shift to the image. An alternative might be to white-balance the camera on the ground and take a photo of a color reference card prior to launching the camera. Neither method take into account atmospherics introduced by the altitude of the camera.
