I think it would be wrong to characterize community as "good" or "bad", as the community consists of multiple contributors, members. 

Your experience was not good with a particular community, maybe due to the nature of the Russian language moderator?  

I have gone through Mozilla's welcoming process(docs only), they really have nice processes in place like having the first issue through Twitter, first-timer tool like ours. 

My short interaction(1 issue solving) with all other communities like Hasura, nexmo, etc was also good. I opened a issue at Codingcoach sometime ago, and they were pretty interactive in the process. 

I started my Open Source journey with Public Lab and the welcome I got here is unbeatable([@warren](/profile/warren) didn't give up on me during my first PR and told me about my silly mistakes in the nicest way). So, I enjoy and learn here.

When I think of the improvement scope at PL, some things do come to mind like delay in getting a review, Inactive issues/PRs, Unclaimed/inactive FTOs, so all related to issue and time management. But, we'll work on these and solve them.

(I am trying to make the window for trying Probot on my repo for realizing it's potential but need some push so if someone wants to collaborate, we can bring some major improvement)

Thanks!
