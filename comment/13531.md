Since you appear to have verified all the individual elements, the solution must be that your overhead "fluorescent" ceiling lights are not the typical fluorescent light. Both my CFL and my small-size fluorescent desk lamp both give similar signatures, but your's looks much more like a halogen in that the spectrum is three broad bands. I believe there are "cool white" T12 type overhead "fluorescent" tubes which have been designed to have much broader spectrums and so do not exhibit the typical spikes of a CFL. If possible, you could find out what the replacement "fluorescent" tubes are and maybe find a plot of their spectrum. The other, less likely, thought is that there are now T12 size "fluorescent" tubes which actually contain a large number of white light LEDs -- which would not exhibit a CFL spectrum and might have some broad banding. As another test, you might try pointing the spectrometer at a very bright red LED on some piece of equipment if you can find one. Indicator LEDs have a relatively sharp signature. You might have to get the spectrometer up fairly close, but such an LED should not just have a very wide fuzzy band -- it should be a narrow peak.
