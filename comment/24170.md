Awesome post, Sasha. Really loved it ðŸŽ‰ . I can relate to your reference to the `rails-i18n` community. I have contributed and observed some other communities, and yes, practices differ everywhere and I agree that a word of appreciation can make a difference -- the new contributor can become a member and what not ðŸ˜ƒ .
