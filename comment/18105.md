Hi [@nyck31](/profile/nyck31),  The short answer to your question is no.  The spectrometer will measure light in the visible and perhaps short IR wavelengths.  Fentayl does not absorb in this region.  If you went deep enough into the uv you could see an absorbance, but its intensity should not be very high.  As a result, even a uv measurement would not be sensitive enough to make the method useful for the application you envision. Sorry, Jack
