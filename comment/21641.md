Hi, Emiel - thank you very much for reporting this. We'll make a priority to get it fixed in the coming weeks but I apologize that the holidays are starting so in the meantime I recommend rotating your image before uploading -- and again, apologies for the issue!

Even if you check or uncheck the "Spectrum is vertical" box. It will always insert the spectrum in the below manner. It does so on a desktop computer with windows 7, windows tablet with windows 10 and my android phone. I also found out that trying to use the "flip image" option does not do anything.
