pretty straightforward. 

1)generate a file with the emissivity data of tungsten from the table in the attached file or the spectral radiance data of the light source.

2)show the spectrometer that light source

3)create a correction file that makes the display look like the file in step 1

4)apply that file thereafter to all readings

I was skeptical at first but the correction holds extremely well. I temperature regulated our optical bench by gluing a resistor on with epoxy and using pwm to regulate it, that might be necessary for optimum maintenance of the correction, we'll see. 

When I first looked at a black body source with our first ocean optics unit I had no idea what was going on. It looked like a tsunami. Then I learned nobody was really using them to measure light. The learning curve began. I am thrilled to have found a path to share the knowledge gained.
