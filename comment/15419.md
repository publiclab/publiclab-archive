This is a great overview!  One suggested edit: Include an explanation of how component variability might impact the circuit. I've tried to build this circuit literally dozens of times and about half the time it fails because my resistor / capacitor values are incorrect or I haven't taken into account speaker resistance or I've gotten the wrong voltage for the 555 and burnt out the timer or it's simply not making a tone in the audible range.  

One solution is to post a set list of components -- better would be to post some explanation of which components matter and what acceptable parameters are (for resistors, capacitors, tolerance on the 555, and power) so that people actually can drop in whatever components they have on hand.  As written it suggests that that's possible, where there seem to be a lot of fail points that are relatively easy to hit if you're not taking ranges into account.
