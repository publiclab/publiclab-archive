I think the 1/16" stuff-- .060", 1.5mm is pretty stiff but workable-- I'd check out the .040 stuff too, because its half the price.   I think the biggest issue is light transmission, but I've only worked with the white stuff, so I can't speak for the black sheet.

if you score the interior of a fold, styrene sheets fold great.  it might be possible to lightly zap the surface with a laser to "score".
