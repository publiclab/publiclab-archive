Hi and apologies for the late response. The OpenROV community may have more folks working on this issue, for instance see https://forum.openrov.com/t/live-streaming-video-to-internet/7104/19 , which references another project that has set up signal boosters along their path of travel in order to get wireless live video out of underwater caves: https://www.reddit.com/r/caving/comments/9koe0s/018_cave_rover_1_first_successful_cave/
