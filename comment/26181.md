Thank you, Chris, for helping to clarify my question. In fact, as you suspected, I was misusing the term "bandpass"! Those I signify with a "K" followed by a 3-digit number are all, to my knowledge, cutoff filters, where as the other three I currently own are bandpass filters. 

Upon revisiting the question I posed, I now see how I can refine it to make it less vague; however, I am new to this forum and don't know how to revise it without just posting an entirely new question. Does anyone know how? 

My revised question would read as follows: **How can I make IR photos derived from various cutoff filters useful for creating NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) images?**
