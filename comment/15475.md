[@warren](/profile/warren) I have used an automotive type flat black rust paint which is available locally and comes as a spray can application or in a 237ml can for brush. Also have completed upgrades as suggested originally by [@stoft](/profile/stoft) with some modifications to suit my purpose one of which I tapped a  13/64" - 5,16mm hole with a 1/4-20 tpi thread to mount the spectrometer onto a tripod. Also I used some flat black cardstock to line the interior  and just painted the areas that were not convenient to line with paper.
