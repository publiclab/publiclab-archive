I just got a new laptop with Windows 10. Installed the Arduino IDE and plugged in the riffle. Couple of sounds relative to a new device being plugged in. No device in the Arduino port tab.

Went away for 15 minutes. Upon returning I restarted Arduino and opened the device manager in preparation of going thru a grueling driver install. Like magic the CH340 was attached as COM3 and ready for action.

Being a dedicated Linux user this was a pleasant surprise!!
