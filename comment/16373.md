Hi, Nick, thanks! Using an arduino to switch pumps or valves seems totally plausible. For prototyping, fans was easier, and I do wonder if we could:

1. look up flow rates and specs for fans and pumps
2. emprically measure flow with both (like how [@mathew](/profile/mathew) did [with the minibuck](https://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/06-11-2015/mini-buck-vs-the-bubbles))

How did Consumer Reports measure this? But you're right, we should probably first try to get this running with pumps. 

Questions:

1. Is a 1 or 2 gallon jar big enough to do a test with a week-long period?
2. Are there any smaller pumps that would still work?

Valves:

* http://www.instructables.com/id/Controling-a-solenoid-valve-with-an-Arduino/ (too big)
* http://www.trossenrobotics.com/solenoid_valve ($20 :-/)
* https://www.adafruit.com/product/997 $7, but huge

I think we could use adapters or something there... but do we need a seal that tight? For air, could we just flip a flap with a servo or something? But it'd be audible... hmm.
