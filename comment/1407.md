So we're talking a basic old-fashioned incandescent bulb that has clear glass, right? Cool - that should be super easy to get a hold of. Should we still use teflon as the "white" or should we try to directly measure the spectrum? I think it's possible but bears some testing. This one had a whitish diffusing coating:

You can download the data in XML/JSON/CSV, so I wonder if we could attempt this calibration now in Excel?
