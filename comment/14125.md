I included a nylon threaded stud in the kit, thinking it would be possible to attach to the pendulum allowing a camera to be attached with a mini ball tripod head, for oblique photos.

Turned out it was easier than i thought. 
I tried it like so:

And it turns out to be super strong. The zip tie binds into the rubber band when you tug on it, and I managed to do a swing test at "whoosh-whoosh" speeds in the office. It is not falling off!
