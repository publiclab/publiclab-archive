This looks like nicely elegant and simple solution. I might add two things: 1) a lanyard that connects the camera to the second smallest pole section (it can be duct taped to the pole), and 2) a plug inserted into the end of the pole to prevent crushing. The plug might not be critical, but it's so easy to do that it might be worthwhile.

Very cool,
