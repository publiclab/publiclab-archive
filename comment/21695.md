Hi Benjamin!!! Sorry, i wasn't referring to the giant tag graph, but to the list of tags manually selected and featured at [https://publiclab.org/tags](https://publiclab.org/tags). I think, similarly, that it could be challenging to categorize them into 5-6 groups, but even if it's not perfect, it'll be better for people visiting the site to not see so many... it's just a bit too many to be easily read through. I think definitely 7 or fewer would be best to aim for.&nbsp;

> I'm not entirely sure what you mean by manually sorting them, but I think the problem there would be that some tags belong to both categories. There are two pieces to the tag graph, the calculation of tag co-occurrence (and subsequent removal of co-occurrences below a given threshold), and then the community detection. You might be able to get away with just doing co-occurrences. That code would be easy enough to transfer from python to ruby to run every so often. Now that there is a web dev (hi by the way!) you could also just implement the javascript version of tagoverflow and replace the data.
