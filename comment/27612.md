[@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1) [@mimiss](/profile/mimiss) thanks for this discussion. I had initially asked, "How much do the tedlar bags cost?" 

[@mimiss](/profile/mimiss) provided the following specifics:
The Bucket uses 5 Liter tedlar bags. Public Lab has been able to source them for $16.50 each from the supplier weâ€™re using: https://www.skcinc.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=779
