The EPA has a model for this, called BENMAP-CE, where you can calculate economic benefits of reducing different kinds of air pollution, like you mention.   But it's complicated!  I haven't been trained on it.  I'm sure, if you search the research behind it, that there are studies that will discuss what you're looking for.

[Co-Benefits Risk Assessment Screening Model (COBRA)](https://www.epa.gov/benmap/reduced-form-tools-calculating-pm25-benefits)- This as a screening tool that helps U.S. states and localities estimate the health and related economic benefits of changes in emissions of directly-emitted PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors.
