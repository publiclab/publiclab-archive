That's true, but we currently use DrupalNodes for wiki pages, events, research notes, and questions, and it's nice in that other infrastructure around the site can assume a common content model and unique `nid`. There are lots of benefits, so I think we'd have to examine the exact benefits of creating a separate model before moving that direction.
