Mathew:  Perhaps I am not understanding some objectives here.  Is the idea to be able to use one of our measurements in court?  I doubt that that is the purpose.  Is it then more about concerns for PL's reputation or is it negligent operators?  Accomplishing a "fool" proof system sounds rather expensive to me.  Probably the objective is reasonably compromising between cost and automation. This http://www.komyokk.co.jp/kweb/pbtop.do?pbno=1002&je=1 is more like what I am thinking would be best.  Has anyone received a quote on this?  Would it work with the formaldehyde tube?
