That's going to be an awesome prairie. I hope you can keep up with the kudzu. Are you going to repair the pole? Some standard fiberglass fabric soaked in epoxy and wrapped around the split part will probably work great, but that section won't nest inside the other poles any more. Maybe even a strip of an old polyester shirt soaked in epoxy will work. I guess you should sand the shiny pole first. Those carp poles are great tools but are not designed to have pressure on them between the reinforced ends. Maybe try attaching the camera at the end where there is an extra layer of material and epoxy.  Although if you repair the pole you will have that in the middle of a section!
