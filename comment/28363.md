Thought this might be of interest to some.  I dug around and found 2-3 global efforts to track meteors. The tracking efforts involve not just identifying the occasion of a meteor, but include a coordinated effort to characterize the path of a meteor and also characterize the impact area. These groups are the ones who worked together to provide an impact location for recent meteor that [came down in the UK](https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1404273/meteor-uk-map-where-did-meteorite-fragments-land-gloucestershire-fireball-evg). I'm working with the group at Western Ontario University (Global Meteor Network) that has cameras scattered across Europe and North America. 

I am just finishing up the installation and calibration of a camera and attached are 1) a STACKED image of all the meteors detected last evening, and 2) a video of a sky from dusk until dawn that includes not only meteors, but planes, satellites, etc.
