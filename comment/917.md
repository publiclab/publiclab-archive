Did you see this post from last week? Very exciting: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/6-12-2012/mobile-android-version-spectral-workbench

BTW, I haven't been able to get a hold of mmittler (http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/mmittler/3-10-2012/spectrometer-hardware-higher-resolution) which is too bad.
