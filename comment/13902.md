Thanks for replying Dave, yes I should have stated more clearly that the LEDs, if they were causing fluorescence then as you stated, it's buried in the noise. The reason I have the laser directly inline with the sample and slit are for that very reason you stated, to maximize the laser signature. I have tried to aim the laser at 90deg to the sample, even with the cuvette right in front of the slit (I used every slit width I had,) and all my intensities were all below 25 percent on workbench capture.

The cuvettes that I have are frosted on 2 sides, it's suppose to maximize light intensity within the cuvette and also it's handy for not putting finger print all over it. The 180 on the SNR is the analyte,

The methylene blue is for 2 purposes, one is, since it is such a common stain used in biology and has a very distinct singature I want to see if I can use that as a calibration curve.

No problem, I can certainly present a separate piece of my exact step by step process and the chemistry behind why I am doing that, I guess I just assume that most everyone here just knows that. Some of my reasoning behind such complex sample preparation, is that refined oil has additives in it that can skew data in directions that might not be where you want to go.

Also I paid attention to one of your notes and you were talking about when taking the spectral image to just have the rgb channel just barely clipping the top.I found your line of thought on more data collection on that level interesting.

You are right though, there is a stability problem with this design but I am trying to tweak it.


Thanks again Dave for your input have a good one!
