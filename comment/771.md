from a construction standpoint you're certainly right, a rectangle would be easier-- but for legal reasons we have to keep the balloon less than 6' long. A 6' rectangle won't hold much gas unless its fairly square.

also, a rectangle is an unstable balloon shape, a circle is much more structurally sound.

carefully taped seams can be air tight with special care, but I don't recommend that as a balloon seaming method.  it gets especially hard when the seam is longer than can easily be done with one piece of tape (about 3'), and the corners are especially difficult.

Glues don't work very well on plastic films.  3M makes a good epoxy for the purpose but it is very, very pricy.  

ultimately the goal here is to make a whole lot of balloons, not a one-off. The jig, if it works, will be well worth the time.
