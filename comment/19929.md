node: Why do raw RGB values differ from calibrated RGB values? I thought calibration just set pixels to wavelength (nm)?

On using only raw data (eg. using the CSV 'avg' data): Yes, you could implement a simple linear mapping of pixel:nm with the data from a CFL spectra. Then (and assuming the hardware remains unchanged) apply that mapping to all measurement spectra. Finally, assuming no clipping of RGB channel data, you could perform the difference (water reference vs test sample) -- all using the 'raw' data. The SWB 'calibrate' feature is a convenience; it's not mandatory to doing the spectra processing in another space like a spreadsheet.
