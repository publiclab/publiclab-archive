Thanks [@Bronwen](/profile/Bronwen), I see it now. I'll run through the wiki. The goal would be to do water quality monitoring, just like the Riffle is intended for. I'm particular interested in drinking water quality, so this might not be an ideal fit, but I'm just starting to research in the space and this caught my eye.
