Hi [@sidntrivedi012](/profile/sidntrivedi012)! One of the reasons we began developing the self-contained version SWB Capture was to make it more modular, better maintained, cleaner code, and then to re-integrate this new version back into the "parent" Rails app. Kind of like how https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js graphing features drive the core of https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench ui -- actually it used to be run from within the Rails app, and we spun it out. 

Also, similarly to how https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor is a sub-component of https://github.com/publiclab/plots2 ! But it has its own test suite and is easier to work on in isolation. 

And, by working in this way, we can make it easier to integrate the sub-project into other projects as well -- more re-usable! 

So, we'd love to review your proposal. Thank you!
