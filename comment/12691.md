Would you be willing to try a recalibration using the 436/546 lines as a starting point? Would that be useful as a point of comparison?

Also - I believe I've gotten a root mean square error system running but its results seem inconsistent to me. I can show you at LEAFFEST, but maybe some tweaking will help -- it's possible I've made a mistake. It's not notably better than the old "fitness" system.
