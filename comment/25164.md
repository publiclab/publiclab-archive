I did this! Here's what i changed: 
- the cord on the battery was so short i had to velcro it directly on top of the flap that the camera was velcroed to underneath
- instead of zip ties to hold the camera, i used two rubber bands that wrapped around the camera and battery together
- i cut an arc on the bottom of the coroplast so that the lens wasn't capturing a white edge in the picture frame. 

Thanks to Eymund Diegel ([@eymund](/profile/eymund)) and Ada Li for being the flight team in NYC's Central Park on Friday July 26!
