I still have some questions on this. Whether it is a good idea to do the heavy lifting of parsing on the user's CPU or it could be well-managed by the server or not.
The file will have to be submitted through a form and saved to be displayed in per-user data, that can be done asynchronously as well, so that shouldn't pose as a problem.
A problem that could come up, is if the library is not able to handle the file's format ie there are errors in parsing, there will be difficulty in reporting them. But at the server side, something like Sentry can be used to get the logs and fix the errors.
So could you please give your points of view on this so that we can find the best possible solution to the problem? Thanks a lot!
