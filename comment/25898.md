When discussing ways to make the blinking light easier to read/a bit more accessible at last night’s event we flirted with the idea of 3 LEDs that would be on/off for a general low/medium/high. 1 light-low, 2 light-med, 3 light-high. Where to set those thresholds is a big question, but it could be a quick way for people to see something in the field when deciding where to look next or which samples to send for further testing.&nbsp;

That way it is adaptable for different abilities too.  I don't know if we could have one port drive a light, slowly, and a second port drive a buzzer, 10x speed?  Secondly, I was also thinking of sensitivity, and had thought of a logarithmic scale. But, that could add some complexity in reading it, like, blinking 2x as fast means... uh... see, i can't even do that in my head, but i'm not great at this kind of math. Maybe there's another way to add resolution to the blink, without losing range?  Thanks for the input!
