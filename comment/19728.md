Your paper liner really sucks and doesn't fold well at all. I will be designing and 3D printing an opaque enclosure to replace most of the legos and paper liner. A much slicker solution that would probably be cheaper for y'all to manufacture than buying legos. Will have much tighter tolerances too. I suggest you guys switch to this!
