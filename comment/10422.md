I have updated this note to include a link to the new colormap, which is also here:  

<a href="https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/007/012/original/NDVI_VGYRM.lut"><i class="icon icon-file"></i> NDVI_VGYRM.lut</a>

This should be copied to the C:\Program Files (x86)\Fiji\Fiji.app\luts directory or something like that on Windows, and I guess to .../Applications/Fiji.app/luts on Mac.
