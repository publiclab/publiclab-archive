Hi! I appreciate that you've made space both for design work (mockups, wireframes) and for things like testing and such -- great breadth! 

Your notes on `woofmark` are right on:

> "The better place to make this fix is at the woofmark library level."

this is a complex stack of libraries and you've hit on the distinctions between each layer and where issues come up. Great job!

I also like your documentation of issues with screenshots and annotations. This kind of communication is key for problem solving!

Finally, i want to point out that one of the reasons the editor has some tough bugs is that it is a relatively stateless project - that is, you can't just post a link to a page where a bug is occurring... instead, it may involve inputting text and interacting with the editor in a very specific way, and this makes documenting and reproducing bugs pretty tough. This is a tough problem but you've written a strong proposal and I wondered if you had thoughts on how to make such documentation and bug reproduction smoother or easier for folks? 

Thank you!
