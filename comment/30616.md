Every 4-5 years or so the spillway is opened which in turn mixes the fresh and salt water. This may seem minor and a tiny in connivance, but this is life or death for the animals and their ecosystem. For an example the white and brown shrimp’s population deplete a lot when the water is mixed because saltwater animals cannot survive in freshwater. There are also many fish species that die because they didn’t get far enough away for the freshwater to survive the mixing. This also affect the people that make a living off catching these fish because there isn’t enough anymore to make a real profit.
