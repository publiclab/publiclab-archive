[@stoft](/profile/stoft) has proposed a set of tests and thresholds for different rigidity"standards" of sorts, here: https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/09-15-2016/what-mechanical-specs-can-and-should-plab-spectrometers-meet

They include things like types     "3"  stresses and a "drop test" from different heights. 

I also think we might differentiate between desired rigidity when transported in its box (packaging) vs during use. 

**Update:** we tried out this set of tests! Read more here: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-17-2016/stress-testing-the-desktop-spectrometry-starter-kit
