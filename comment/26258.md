This is a suggestion, only.  I worked in the polymer industry for many years.  This included rubber chemicals.  One of the chemicals commonly used as a reinforcing agent and coloring agent in rubber is carbon black ( or a variant like furnace black).  A lot of the processes discussed in the Indian company's brochure were similar to what we tested for in carbon black.

Maybe it would be good to investigate some carbon black proceeses?  One company used to be Continental Carbon.  And the Astm and I so had a number of test methods for carbon black ( particle size, surface area, etc.).
