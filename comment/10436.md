Wow... excellent information... thanks.  I am a newbie, and my questions will be indicative of that.... I see now that I may assemble two spectrometers.... one handheld as received in the kit following instructions verbatum.  the second one might be a 30 cm unit as mentioned in the text.  I wonder about preservation of observations.  The camera you mention in your "conclusions diagram"... is it just a standard digital camera.  is there any to superimpose a gradient onto (or into) that display.  is the light reflected by the defraction grating intense enough to be viewed on a white surface eg. an index card.  my thought is to draw gradient on the index card (along with any other notes) set it up as a "projection screen" and then photograph the image on the card.... ya think?
