[@BSweet](/profile/BSweet) This is all very helpful, and the carbon filter for the window will help people who can't afford A/C in the summer. I would like to chat more about carbon products when windows are closed. Do you have a link for a product example? I don't know much about these as I'm only a HEPA user at my house. Also, as far as chatting more, I'm thinking we might arrange a video conference/call as Public Lab offers an "Open Hour" focused talk 1/month where anyone can join in. I don't know if you are already subscribing to the Air Quality feed for emails, but it would be great to have you around!
