Good points Chris. I'm always curious as to the factors in design decisions and know to dose any suggested "improvements" with humbleness. I hope that came across in our email discussion.

My first kites arrived yesterday, thanks to the Public Lab store. Some test flights might happen this weekend, but 1000 feet of 120 pound Dacron is at least a week from arriving, so I won't be getting too ambitious.
