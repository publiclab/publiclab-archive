I posted a lot of findings about many other filters today, with sample pictures. I got my sample book of 200 filters (of which are ca. 80 of some use) yesterday from Edmund optics. If you think it is better, you might move that to a separate post or chapter.
  

I expect quite a few more posts, as I am daily finding out new things and thinking up new practical solutions.&nbsp; An ideal activity, next to gardening, to get through the&nbsp;corona social distancing episode!
