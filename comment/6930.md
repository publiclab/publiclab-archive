Thanks for your compliment :-) Glad you liked the new features.

We came up with the present system assuming that the spectrums would be calibrated, and thus at present this will work for (and on) only the calibrated ones. But before going to match the uncalibrated ones, we need to study more about the issues about the current one in place. Matching the spectrums purely by using the appearance of peaks wont be much difficult I suppose, but that requires some calculations, remodeling the current system etc. . Let us extend the system to cover the uncalibrated ones in the future enhancements for this feature.

Thanks for pointing this out. I forgot adding this in the note under the section: "What can this do? And what it can't? ". Updating it now.

Thanks again!
