Cfastie and Agustin If we try to change de index co-dominium? I mean 0 to 1. And the equation of NDVI index must be.. NDVI 1= (1/2)*(NDVI+1) = (1/2)*{(NIR-R)/(NIR+R)+1}. So if we resolve this equation we must get.. NDVI 1=NIR/(NIR+R). If we remove the hot filter from the camera in the three channels we get the three colors plus the NIR. Then, the denominator index we obtain directly from the red channel and de NIR signal from de Green or blue channel directly. To obtain again the NDVI index we get again with (NDVI=2 NDVI 1-1), in order to arrange of the new index (-1<NDVI< 1) is just a easy way. Who agreed with me. Lo podemos discutir en español Agustin.
