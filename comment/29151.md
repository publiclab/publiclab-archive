Notes to facilitator/admins/mods - you can change the feature at the foot of the new dashboard using the Feature name `dashboard-topics-footer` - and it will display whatever you like there. We’ve put the boxes for air quality and water quality there as an example.

A new user sees this as their dashboard, which makes that configurable footer feature very good real estate to recruit newcomers into specific topics:
