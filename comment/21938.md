Hi,
I have some trouble previewing my processed DNG images in Matlab, but the channel values are similar to the ones in your image. Since the red channel values are always higher than the blue channel values (hence the red hue), NDVI must be negative for all surfaces (NIR-VIS is negative when VIS, that is red channel, is so high).

I came up with another idea to estimate the red channel contamination today. My results show that the contamination isn't a fixed value - it's higher for plant targets compared to targets with flat reflectance curve along the spectrum. I've just looked at the data from "no white balance" DNG, and it's clear that the difference between the red and blue channel is proportional to the contamination of the red channel with NIR. In fact, it's almost a 1:1 relationship (x = 0.983y, R2 = 0.735). That means that by subtracting blue channel value from the red channel, we can get a good estimation of VIS in red channel. Once I did that, I received a beautiful NDVI image without any white balancing! :) I'll try to upload some in a while.
