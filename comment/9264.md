The choice of SVG sounds like a good one.  I'm excited to be able to export high res annotations too.

Horizontally oriented text is the most readable in block form, but using it exclusively on a map will reduce readability. I turned all the labels horizontal on your header image to illustrate:

 A horizontal label on a vertical geographic feature is illegible by itself.  Which street is which? we don't know.
Every annotated feature will have a horizontal label and a shape describing or pointing it out, that will be visually cluttered and effect readability for the whole map.

I think rotatable text is a part of the core specification for this project, not an optional feature.
