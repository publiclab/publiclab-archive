<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Perhaps if you collect both secchi and turbidity data frequently over a long time period at different sites and plot all the data, you could identify a relationship(s). The tricky part is that at different seasons you have more or less organic matter, which changes the trend.</p>&mdash; Cyndhia R.
