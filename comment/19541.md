[@warren](/profile/warren), I don't know JS at all and am not versed enough in using RPi, but there are some good sources for RPi which I pointed [@maggpi](/profile/maggpi) to at her page, I hope that she gets up and running with it I'll be able to learn from her and that we will write up some summary/comparison.
