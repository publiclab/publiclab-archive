I actually think there's an advantage to stepped grading, because 

a) it's easier to pick out the pattern -- like a barcode -- vs. continuous change which could be for another reason like light against a receding wall

b) steps allow the device to average spatially to smooth sensor noise, without dipping into differently exposed data
