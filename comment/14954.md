[@tonyc](/profile/tonyc), [@mathew](/profile/mathew), [@warren](/profile/warren), [@stevie](/profile/stevie), [@donblair](/profile/donblair): I think an additional stretch goal that would be worthwhile is to be able to control the trap cam with a microcomputer that receives input from a sensor (e.g. so a turbidity spike could turn on the camera).
