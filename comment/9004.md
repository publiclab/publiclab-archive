$300 would admittedly be a challenge, but a $500 quad with decent lift and up to an hour of flight time is not only possible, I've seen it done a number of times.   The only reason I haven't done it is I'm still aiming for that $300 mark!  A lot of it comes down to the ESC/Motor combination and whether or not you can get away with one of the new all-in-one ESCs... (I won't clog the comments up with links but I've been following a couple interesting builds if anyones interested).
  The point about wind is well taken, and it actually leads into my answer to the suggestion that we go with a kite instead. In short, KAP is pretty much all we've been doing because of the logistical issues mentioned earlier about obtaining helium.  I actually went into this very issue in detail in another research note from yesterday- http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/05-06-2014/simple-weather-alert-web-app-for-grassroots-mappers.  The problem is, even living on the coast doesn't guarantee sufficient wind conditions all the time. For example, as of this writing I am right on the coast and windspeeds top out at 6MPH.  Our experiments outlined in the other research note showed us that winds need to peak around 15mph for us to get the kite to a steady altitude.  The thing that I like about the Kite/Balloon combo is that they compliment each others strengths/weaknesses.  In other words if there's not enough wind for a kite, then it might be perfect conditions for a balloon.  This would work out perfectly if we were in the habit of keeping a full tank of helium in the closet, but lacking this requires an element of planning (which was the motivation behind the other note).  With quadcopter tech getting ever affordable and capable, there may well be a role for it to fill some of the gaps created by notoriously unpredictable New England weather and a worldwide helium shortage.  In short...  If it hasn't happened already, Moore's Law would eventually triumph over Newton's...

   Of course, there is one form of law that nullify's Moore's law   ...  That is the very real law enforced by the F.A.A!  I must admit that I was operating under the assumption that citizen science/educational use would be covered under "personal hobby activities" so long as its within line of site?  Do you need to get clearance to use the images for mapping?  Or because it is working within a school context? I certainly hope they get that straightened out by their deadline next year.  Otherwise we'll just have to pretend we're making deliveries for Amazon...
