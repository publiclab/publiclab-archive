The diversity of life in an ecosystem is called biodiversity. The more diversity in an ecosystem, the more stable its structure is. Biodiversity helps keep interdependent organisms and whole ecosystems alive. Bluefin tuna is the most popular type of tuna eaten by humans. Their population has decreased by a 95%. If bluefin tuna were to go extinct, it is likely that these sea creatures would quickly become overpopulated. This would cause a sort of domino effect as the increase in numbers of these animals would lead to a decrease in the populations of their prey. This is why biodiversity is important.
