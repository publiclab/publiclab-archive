Actually the macro always worked with jpeg images. In ImageJ/Fiji. It has always been able to read any image format recognized by ImageJ/Fiji. Sorry that wasn't clear early on. 

I just committed a bunch up updates to the macro based on comments Chris left on GitHub. The macro now has three options for registration algorithms which should make it more robust. I also added some basic error and processing information. Feedback always welcome.

I am trying to keep the user guide up to date with the software updates. If the guide isn't clear or if additional information would be helpful let me know. If you have something to contribute to the coding or documentation that would be great too.
