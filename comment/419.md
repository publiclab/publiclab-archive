Thanks from the "sensei" :-)

As i mentioned in my post, i just redrew the diagram (with some minor changes) from one posted by "ad": http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/ad/11-28-2011/thermal-camera-arduino-uno-mlx90614-ir-thermometer

I couldn't figure out how she made hers or how to edit it, so I used Frizting to redraw it and posted the design files in my post. (they're listed at the bottom)

It'd be nice to be able to track revisions of a design (and associated files) more explicitly, (see some old ideas we had for this here: https://github.com/jywarren/plots/issues/38) but it's kind of a tough problem to tackle. Would we ask each person to enter a series of links to referenced work, when they post? Maybe we could have the posting form suggest similar recent posts, based on keywords or tags?

In some ways we're going to have to put in extra effort to replicate some of the things software collaborators get "for free", i.e. every piece of code contributed has someone's name attached to it. But as long as we keep it easy to do, it'll be nice to see how many people come together around a given project.
