If you're wanting to use a multicoper for mapping, I'm working on automating many parts of that workflow for my dissertation. By the end of the summer I'm hoping to have the post-processing routines finished so that it is probably to fly a quadcopter manually and have it collect photos which are then merged and converted both into georeferenced 3d point clouds and georeferenced orthophotos. I could imagine that that's interesting for baseline mapping. My software will work with multispectral imagery from a single camera. Right now I'm waiting for drone parts to arrive in the mail in order to get going and have just been working on some small matters for the sensors, as documented in part here:

 That's more for low-proximity mapping, but it's planned to expand that for aerial mapping as soon my parts arrive.
