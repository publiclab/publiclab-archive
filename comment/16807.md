Hi Patrick. I'm currently out in the field as part of a research team and won't be back to my lab for a few weeks. Once I get back I can look at some of the data I took and give you an answer to the accuracy and precision. For long term deployments I believe the stability of the reading is mostly going to be effected by biofouling. I have thought about putting a waterproof servo with a brush on the probe to wipe the electrodes, but I haven't gotten around to it yet...
