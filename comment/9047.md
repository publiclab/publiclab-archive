The existing peak detection code, and notes on its shortcomings, is here: https://github.com/jywarren/spectral-workbench/blob/master/webserver/public/javascripts/api.js#L68-L181

One of the big problems was that if one peak were missed, the ratios wouldnt be recognized because they're order-dependent!
