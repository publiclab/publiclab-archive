[@cummins_leila](/profile/cummins_leila) great question! You might appreciate this activity from Public Lab contributor [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) over at one of our partners (another non-profit) Healthy Gulf:

Last fall, Public Lab held our monthly interactive event, OpenHour, and we got to learn more about this project. You can watch the archived recording on our website here, scroll down to October 2020: https://publiclab.org/wiki/openhour-archive
