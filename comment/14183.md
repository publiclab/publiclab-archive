Hello Ned,
Hello Chris,
I'm reading the manual on the use of PhotoMonitoring, and specifically the section on "Calculate image calibration coefficients plugin".
The guide talks about how to calculate the calibration coefficient of the image, using a single NIR-modified camera.
In our case (with a group of friends including PeppePegasus et alt) We recently purchased 2 MAPIR (RED + NIR) and we would like to understand, if possible, how to proceed with the calibration and use of radiometric target.
Would you be kind enough to show us some link or document where to study and investigate the calibration mode, and if it is possible to implement the plugin PhotoMonitoring so that it can calibrate the images from two cameras (RED + NIR)?
Thanks so much
