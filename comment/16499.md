Vue.js also seems really interesting, thanks for suggesting it! Would it be (i'd prefer) an optional UI implementation for the project, alongside direct commandline (nodejs) use and (for example) a flow-based visual UI? Is there any way you could provide a kind of diagram of how the UI might be architected, a bit like the diagram here: https://publiclab.org/notes/mridulnagpal/03-01-2017/map-of-projects and/or a mockup of how it might look?

Thanks for your proposal and apologies for my slowness in replying!
