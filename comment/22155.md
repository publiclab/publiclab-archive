 Hi! This is really cool. I will go through it in more depth soon, but just for context, did you see this design in the shared Google Doc for mockups? https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TCZoTfuhamRVrUak8aDgqJAwSgyhRtZg2Pgacl2_4zc/edit#slide=id.gfb2aa1b7ddf791c_5

I like a lot of the ideas in your mockups! Perhaps we could try to incorporate them and make a composite of the designs?
