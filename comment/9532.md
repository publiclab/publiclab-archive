There was a really good book that I once had a skim read through - where the author said that, what the evolution of our universe, and all the important events in human history, comes down to is the evolution of information systems...so when you talk about peer to peer...I like to think of those *good old days* where scruffy academics, dressed in their raincoats, would amble down alleysways and exchange between them scrappy notes. :)
