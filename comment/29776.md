Collecting microplastics was more interesting than I expected. I mostly saw plastic bottles, food wrappers, foam cups, wood, nails, etc. It could possibly take hundreds of years for those kinds of things to disintegrate. Those kinds of plastics didn't seems as though they were biodegradable. Polluted waterways can affect reliant communities by causing health issues or simply affecting one's job and pay. The jobs and pay can be affected because most of the jobs in Louisiana take place in or on the Mississippi River. If they were to bring in seafood or fish from the Mississippi River and it was contaminated by the microplastics then no one would want them and the market for fish and seafood would take a tremendous crash.
