Roolark,

Would you be willing to post a link to your thesis or some more details regarding how you manipulated RAW data? I am interested to know if you used MATLABs functionality to extract RAW sensor data without applying a WB correction? There is no sense in us covering the same old ground.  It may be that specific cameras have to be calibrated for a specific object.
