I love the lego hack! Maybe we should make one entirely of lego. They're very precise.

[@Guillaume123](/profile/Guillaume123) - if I understand correctly, Cindy said it worked **better** with the ribbed side, which I'm glad to hear as I'd suspected that would be helpful: 

> if the laser enters the sample through the ribbed side and the spectrometer captures the light coming out from the smooth side, more frequencies seem to be captured

Did you find that not to be true?
