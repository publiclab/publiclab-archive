Just wanted to link over to this discussion of copper "badges": https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/12-06-2017/what-are-some-options-for-copper-materials-to-make-a-copper-plate-test-kit

I was looking for some pre-cut smaller pieces of copper in standard sizes, in part to avoid the warping that cutting big sheets with shears can cause. I found these copper stamping blanks that have 2 holes predrilled:

They're $13 for 10, so $1.30 each, and the holes could make it easier to mount them.
