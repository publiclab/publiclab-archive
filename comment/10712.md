This looks great!

I am really impressed with the resolution of your spectra

On the USB cable.

My spectrometer broke when the pins came out of the modular plug on the USB cable.

Can I recommend trying to house the join between the cable & the camera chip board itself?

On the light from the USB hole.

In keeping with what [@hank](/profile/hank) said.

Most offices have blue tack lying around sparsely. Would that work?
