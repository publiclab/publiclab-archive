Regarding overexposure, If I am not mistaken, most intelligent phones have a lux-meter embedded near the frontal camera. It is used in measuring ambiant light in order to ajust display luminosity. By download the appropriate app, it is possible you could direct the lux-meter towards sample areas you wish to photograph. One of them could be chosen as a reference. 

By crossing the light level measured by the lux-meter and the quality of resulting pictures, you could build a chart for best light conditions in a given area.

Also, I don't know if your camera has adjustable parameters regarding exposure, but if so, this could be taken into account in your "optimal exposure chart". I hope this can helpful :)
