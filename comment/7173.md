We don't mess around with school loyalties here at UK. :)

I hadn't considered the fish scale idea, though that seems like it would work. I had thought of carrying something that I could use to measure the circumference of the balloon, since I know that the balloon when fully inflated has more than enough lift. The key is that I need a method that I can do by myself while holding the balloon.
