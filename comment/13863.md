Hi Jeff, 

I am referencing work from multiple ideas because I feel 3 months is a lot of time to get stories accomplished. I will work on adding more details to my proposal. Also, I have Rails setup locally on my computer and I have forked plots2 to my GitHub (https://github.com/franktank/plots2).

Thanks,
Franky
