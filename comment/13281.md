> 1 - Solux4700KGCal_300-800nm_SANM.csv  (My cal curve from my MatLab data)

> 2 - Solux4700KSpectrum_280-800.txt   (My extraction of Solux data from web site)

I got the two files:

<a href="//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/532/original/Solux4700KGCal_300-800nm_SANM.csv"><i class="icon icon-file"></i> Solux4700KGCal_300-800nm_SANM.csv</a>

<a href="//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/533/original/Solux4700kSpectrum_280-800nm.txt"><i class="icon icon-file"></i> Solux4700kSpectrum_280-800nm.txt</a>

So the .txt file is their reported spectrum from their website -- shall we use another absolute intensity calibrated spectrometer (when we can) to confirm this? 

And just to be sure, do I have this right? Each data point of the correction .csv is the Solux reported lamp spectrum divided by the Public Lab v3 Desktop Spectrometer scan of a Solux lamp?
