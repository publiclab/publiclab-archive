I wanted to add this also to my note above, 

Notice panel# 3, this is the 0.09mm acetate film slit with the embedded imperfections and how that attenuates the peak at 539nm, on panel# 4 this is not the case because of the new "open-air" design of the 0.11mm Gillette razor blade slit. Now what I did to prove my theory correct was, I took my plastic cuvette and put only a few minor scratches and finger prints on the forward facing side, and as you can see on panel# 5, the same attenuation that is seen on panel# 3 is apparent on panel# 5.

So perhaps it does make enough of a difference using the acetate film strips as entrance slits. In general, it may not matter too much but for detail chemical analysis it would make a difference because of resolution and skewing of data, because the detector doesn't discriminate between smudges or scratches, it records it as absorption...very bad!
