There's a simple test people can do sometimes referred to as "the stick test." In this method,  you would use a stick or a rock to poke a hole in the sheen. In a bacterial sheen, "the sheen will typically break into small platelets.  In contrast, a petroleum sheen will quickly try to reform after any disturbance."   

Another test you can do is smell the sheen. If it has no smell it's likely bacterial, if it smells like oil or gas, it's likely a petroleum product.
