 Hey [@warren](/profile/warren) here's my first draft of the proposal. It would be great if you could review it!
Also, I'm a bit skeptical about the timeline. I think 3 months might be too much for the upgrade? Should I add a few small subprojects as well?
Thanks!

(Also I don't know why the editor is adding so many extra links at the end. I can't remove them.)
