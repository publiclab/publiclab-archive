Wow this looks great -- do you have any spectra on SpectralWorkbench.org you've taken with it?

Some of us in Boston are getting together next Tuesday night to talk about and test oil detection with our spectrometers. We're also talking about a spectrometry hackathon in January. Would love to collaborate with you if you're interested!

Also see this PVC box some of us have been using -- it's very good in preventing light leaks: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/10-12-2012/diy-spectrometry-kit-paper-insert-prototype
