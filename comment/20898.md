oooh, i very impress by your knowleage, i am arriving NOW to PublicLab, and I find your posts, very interesting, because it is something that i trying to do for some time, and I think it is complex to achive reproductibility of results. By the way, I will leave just a message.  I'm working on a Xubuntu 18.04 Labtop, Gnu Octave, Fiji-ImageJ and will try to install Jupyter Notebook , all this to process stream imagens from RPI 3b+, to work on something I hope, Similar to your work, like automatic capture  time-lapse imagens  streammed to the laptop wireless. This means, Scripting on Fiji-ImageJ. Other way is to script an process on line, working with PublicLab spectral resources on line. Something like that. Tks. I will return.jotasbe.
