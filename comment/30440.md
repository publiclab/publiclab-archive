Environmental science branches off to many other different sciences. Environmental health focuses on the relationships between people and their environment. Things that environmental health includes is population, water, food, and healthcare. The current population is over 7 billion people. We are expected to reach 8 billion in 2023. More people are born then people who die. This relates environmental science because it could affect the number of resources we have. If we hit 10billion people, we might have to go to extreme measures to keep the population down. There is an estimated amount of 3% of fresh water. 2.5% of that fresh water is completely unavailable due to pollution. Our soil is also polluted due to the amount of trash on our earth surface. When we hit 10billion the trash would take over the oceans and land. The polluted air affects people health. The air causes health problems like respiratory diseases, heart disease, and some types of cancer.
