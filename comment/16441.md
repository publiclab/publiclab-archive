Looking at razor blades under a microscope. Great idea! I'm working on a microscope which (currently) uses the lens from a laser pointer.

Now that I have it working, I am looking for cool stuff to examine under the microscope. I don't yet have a good way of measuring what I'm examining. Maybe I'll buy a graticule.
