Hi [@alejobonifacio](/profile/alejobonifacio) i wonder if there is an 'ideal' range if we can use resistors or capacitor sizes to shift that to our looked-for "search range" that might be expected in a river or body of water. Though it sounds like you are finding that 0.1 - 1 g/L is already a useful range?
