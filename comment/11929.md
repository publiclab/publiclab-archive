Hi - [@donblair](/profile/donblair) wrote up a great overview of how particulate air sensing works, here: http://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/05-03-2014/how-do-we-measure-particulate-stuff-in-the-air - but as I understand it, particulate sensing is almost always just particle size and count, without trying to identify what particles **are**.

[@mathew](/profile/mathew) wrote a great overview of lots of different ways that different projects/sensors measure particulates: http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/05-05-2015/evaluating-low-cost-optical-dust-sensors

And I've been working with him on running a whole batch of them at the same time, to compare: http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/06-01-2015/plan-for-recording-shinyei-optical-sensors-using-open-pipe-kit

I think it may be hard to measure specific elements in the air - especially at very low concentrations. I don't know much about it, sorry!
