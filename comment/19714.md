Good so far.  [@warren](/profile/warren) Working on ‘cycle’ programs that show different processing effects.   Believe that understanding processing modes could be useful for both spectral imaging and microscope   applications.  This  link, https://youtu.be/XEn5Nd_W7rA , shows a Raspberry Pi V2 visible camera (with picamera software) processing effects demo.  Some  quality is washed out by the time it is uploaded to youtube but most effects are still visible.  The demo also only changes one image setting at a time, I assume some effects would be more visible if multiple settings were changed.

The video demonstrates brightness, contrast, AWB (Automatic White Balance),  Image effects
and exposure processing modes.   Image is displayed at default settings  between modes for comparison.  Over 40 different settings are displayed and the video length is 5:11 minutes.

The camera configuration uses an image from another posting  (  https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/05-11-2018/raspberry-pi-noir-close-up-imaging ) but added a resolution chart to compare with

The hardest part was learning how to handle Raspberry Pi’s  video format h264.  I tried converting the video to MP4 and AVI, but the youtube resolution was bad.  Eventually   I was able to upload h264 and got HD!
