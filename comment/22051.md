 I like this proposal - thanks! Noting 2 things - 

1. there's some good discussion of JS vs. Ruby for charting in Isha's proposal, which would be good to comment on!
2. noting that, as we did last year, it's not a problem for proposals to overlap. We work very collaboratively and we have always found ways to share work and break things up into related parts. In fact, it often results in better code if 2 brains team up on a project ü§ù
