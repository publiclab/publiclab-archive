Hi, this seems like it could be dangerous, and I don't know much about it. But are you talking about this: https://publiclab.org/notes/bwilliams/10-9-2012/carbon-arc ?

Do you know that there's a visible range (400-700nm) emission spectrum from lead, and do you have any link or reference to an example of that kind of analysis to base your research off of?
