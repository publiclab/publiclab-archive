[@Ecta64](/profile/Ecta64) that's interesting, and it makes sense that the panorama would turn out that way since the bend at the top of the pole is rotating along with the camera. I guess the trick would be figuring out where the "bagel hole" overlaps with the edges of the next bagel if you're trying to map a large area. We haven't had a chance to stitch the photos from the park, so I'm not sure if [@mathew](/profile/mathew) and I guessed right on the spacing from that mapping.
