I mentioned the new calibration procedure on the chat (esp. [@MelissaN](/profile/MelissaN) [@ygzstc](/profile/ygzstc)), and I just posted a note about it: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-30-2015/new-wavelength-calibration-procedure-preview-for-spectral-workbench-2-0

You can take it for a spin, but please be aware; it's a preview release, so no promises!
