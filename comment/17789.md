There are some really cheap cameras on the market now; similar seeming in specs, maybe better cameras, but as low as $55:

* $60: **AKASO Trail Camera** - https://www.amazon.com/AKASO-Camera-Infrared-Surveillance-Waterproof/dp/B074BZFJ8C/
* $55: **Trail Game Camera-ENKLOV Wildlife Hunting Camera** -
 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074J743RJ/
* $62: **APEMAN trail camera** - https://www.amazon.com/%E3%80%90Upgraded%E3%80%91APEMAN-Camera-Hunting-Upgrading-Protected/dp/B01NAGLAMJ/
