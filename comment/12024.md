Here's some info i received from [@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) over email: 

OSHA does regulate and test for formaldehyde but their levels are sky high and set in 1987: 750 ppb.  NIOSH however has a TWA of 16 ppb, less than half of Mathew's recent test. http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0293.html California says you shouldn't exceeded 27 ppb in a workplace (8 hrs x 5 days) and probably lower for a home. 8 ppb is the no adverse effects  for exposures over a year. 8 is an important cancer risk threshold I believe--less sure about this though. 

That the regulations are so out of touch with the experience of exposed people (I've seen reactions in the 10s of ppb for sensitized individuals) is a major motivator for the symptoms register part of wwb. 

The newer the product the higher the level. Different products take different times to off-gas. Some a few weeks, some a few years. It's hard to measure the actual flux of how much a cabinet would emit, because the concentration would depend on room size and ventilation. Smaller the space and less ventilation the higher the levels. So popping a test kit inside a new cabinet would yield higher levels. (Maybe also preserve veggies better due to anti fungal hcho properties?)
