Another observation:  It would be good to have a check list for the measurement.   For example:

1.    Verify that the humidity is above ?? and below ??
2.    Record the 6 digit number above the word Japan
3.    Score and break both of the tapered glass ends
4.    Nam sit amet purus sit amet eros blandit ultrices.
5.    Fusce viverra odio quis est elementum convallis.
 
This is just an example.
