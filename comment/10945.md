Yeast is one of the simplest cellular forms of life out there and can be found airborne.

If what you are hinting at is using the airborne strains to ferment beer - sounds like a good idea.

You might want to follow through with [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)'s suggestion to look into Sour Dough Bread.

In middle eastern cultures they leave the sour dough bread, dough outside - where it naturally absorbs yeast and over time expands.

Maybe leaving some dough outside to absorb airborne yeast could provide you with a big enough culture of yeast to start your beer fermenting?
