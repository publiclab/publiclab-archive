Hi Cindy, Dino of GovLab has been remotely supporting Codeando MÃ©xico (Code for Mexico, on twitter at https://twitter.com/CodeandoMexico) since last week, find her on twitter at https://twitter.com/dinorah_cantu and also read her stream to find links to many organized projects with both local and remote volunteers.
