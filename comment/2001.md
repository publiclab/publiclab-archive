This is very cool.  i love all the creeks that are incorporated into the design.  in Louisiana, the sediment is so muddy that containment is usually necessary, which limits the restoration and the design options. 

do you have lat long, so people can see what happened post-Sandy?  I suspect that NOAA captured the change on their DHS response overflight:
