The "HDR" approach to expanding the dynamic range with a banded mask seems very promising -- we often get spectra like this, where the data is blown out in at least one channel: https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/4312

using a standard-width banded mask over the spectrometer could help. In some ways, we are already treating the 3 color bands as 3 exposure levels in a kind of "HDR" image. But we have an extra dimension to work with -- the width of the slot -- so we could have fixed-width bars for high, med, low exposure levels, and try to get multiple exposure levels in the same image.

How are HDR images integrated, and is there a way to remain quantitative when sourcing from 3 different channels? Will blowout in the blue channel screw up comparisons across devices?
