 Hi [@birdlink](/profile/birdlink), let us know some additional information. Just noticed that your post title mentions dew collection systems, and to my limited knowledge those work in "cloud forest" type places where there is a lot of atmospheric water that can be condensed onto a surface so that liquid water runs down and can be captured. I'm idly wondering if that could be applied to the steam clouds that billow from some manhole covers in NYC....but, well, i think not.
