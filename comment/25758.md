We're having difficulty in approving the project due to our supervisors concerns on the case if a rain barrel were to back up the downspout. We're working to provide an explanation on how the problem can be circumvented with a downspout diverter as it drains excess water and materials, hopefully giving us the go ahead to move through in designing a barrel.
