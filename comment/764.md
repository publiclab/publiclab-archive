Tonight I took a few minutes and was able to get the Canon A495 triggering with the CHDK circuit and taking photos that looked reasonable, given the low light level inside the house. Earlier I had trouble. When I looked this evening, on start up, the settings for remote control were not enabled so I checked those off and then it proceeded to work.
I started just by using the USB port connected to the computer to trigger it, then set up the MK 111 timer actuated circuit and it ran triggering from that. So then I started up the A490 which had worked this afternoon and both proceeded to trigger. I went out to the kitchen and shot for a few more images.

A composite of a couple pairs of synched images is at:

Just looking at them I'm wondering about the relative speeds at which the 490 in IR and 495 in visible shoot and save images.

I've set the camera times more closely. They were off by four plus minutes. Then, I'll check this out.
