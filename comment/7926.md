Thanks for the tip about Android Firefox, I just tried it out and was able to access my rear facing camera. I wasn't able to rotate the video feed. I tried pressing rotate button, but I'm not sure if it had any effect. The video feed kept repeating the same row of pixels after I pressed it (I'm not certain it was caused by it though). Also, the page would freeze after I pressed "begin capturing" sometimes (i.e. none of the buttons would work and the camera feed did not update).

W.r.t. native apps, have you looked into building a [phonegap plugin](https://build.phonegap.com/plugins)? That could allow you to keep the HTML interface while using native code to control the camera feed.
