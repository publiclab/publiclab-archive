Wonderful to hear from you! Many residents face this kind of land use impact in their neighborhoods, and it can seem impossible to be heard by City Planning Departments, City Council people, etc. But this is actually the first step refinement towards making progress on this issue that i'd like to ask you: who do you want to reach with the results of the study? Answering this clearly can help us design an appropriate project. Looking forward to hearing back from you!
