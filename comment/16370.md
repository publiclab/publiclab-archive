Hi Liz,
The components wired together weigh 33 grams and the bracket weighs 8 g. The batteries to power it weigh a lot more than that. A case with four AAAs weighs 75 g. I guess you could power this with three AAA or a 3.7v LiPO (45 g). I fly the Saturn V Rig with six AAA so the servos can run for hours. So the new sensor pod (with wires trimmed) will add about 40 g (1.4 ounces) to the Saturn V Rig.
