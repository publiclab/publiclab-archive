No, unfortunately I don't have the discipline for video-capturing anything in life, including this build process. Haven't used the workbench software yet. Envious of Chris Fastie's succinct, well-captured and -edited videos -- have any Public Lab people made any tutorials on how to make decent videos in a streamlined fashion??? Need a baseline level of quality and editing to become second nature. I like Matthias Wandel's and OSE's videos but their capturing processes haven't worked for me.  :r]
