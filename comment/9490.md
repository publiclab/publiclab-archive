I often use platforms that are moving so I use a fast shutter speed to reduce blur. I often shoot somewhere around 1/1000th of a second. You should be able to compensate for different shutter speeds so the resulting NDVI images are similar even if different shutter speeds are used. If you have a reference target in images with different shutter speeds you could calculate the pixel value difference and then adjust the other image by applying an offset. It's possible that correct would require more than a simple offset but that's a good place to start.
