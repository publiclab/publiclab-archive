maybe there's a way to get your state reps to take action and pass a similar rule at the new jersey level, while the national petition works its way through the US Congress?

Can you find legislators to introduce anti-odor and anti-ethylene legislation at the state level?  even if you don't pass a bill, it's good to have a champion or two at your legislature.  often we find that we win very well in court, only to find that the oil lobby changes the law a year after we win the lawsuit. having a friend in the legislature can help stop that kind of corruption. 

I wish we had a better state lege in louisiana, or that's what i would  be doing.   we've often considered donating to their campaigns, like the oil lobby does, although many of us  don't want to participate in that kind of corruption. you'd be surprised / depressed how inexpensive it is to influence the legislature.

be on the lookout for expansions of this kind of facility. Oil and Gas is looking to the Plastics industry to bail them out--to artificially increase the demand for oil and gas, because efficiency improvements and clean energy are tanking their business models.
