Yes, the config file goes on the SD card.

NDVI is based on the proportion of red to NIR light reflected from leaves. That proportion depends in part on the proportion of those colors in the incoming light. So it works best in normal outdoor light.

Variables such as the angle of the leaves, shadows, clouds, and time of day will alter the NDVI values, so distinguishing subtle differences in plant health requires the careful control of these variables.

Your photo (which is not displaying in the note) produces reasonable NDVI values if 50 is added to the DNs in the NDVI image produced by Fiji (that's equivalent to an increase in NDVI of 0.4). To produce reasonable NDVI values directly from a photo:

- use a custom white balance appropriate for your lighting conditions
- take the photos in outdoor light
- expose the photos well (not too dark or too light)
