[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) love the MacGyver example--laughed so hard at this. [@warren](/profile/warren) ty for bringing this up during the recent weekly call. I knew this language rang a bell and it's because I came across it when I first looked into Processing (something I still need to learn). I think there is merit in connecting sensors and p5js because there are a lot of artists and data viz people that are interested in taking the next step, and this may be something they speak. I also think that the whole webjack thing has a lovely old-school quality that some people will find interesting.
