Hi, [@crispinpierce](/profile/crispinpierce) - can you check that the white connecter is fully inserted? I noticed the white light happens also when that cable comes loose. If that still doesn't work, please post a photo and we can help you debug or we can swap you for a new one. 

We can add an SD card logger for about $15, i believe. It does add complexity and some weight, although nowhere near the weight of the battery, which is the main contributor to weight. 

We have also brainstormed some cheaper/lighter options for logging without an SD card, but it's not clear if they'd meet your needs: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/04-02-2019/can-we-log-data-on-an-arduino-without-an-sd-card
