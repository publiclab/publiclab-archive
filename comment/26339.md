The Great Lakes basin has a few nonprofits as well as water treatment utilities working with gardening groups and some county extension Master Gardener educators are beginning to address fertilizer runoff - here in MKE:
MMSD Fresh Coast Guardians offers free workshops to both consumers and lawncare operators to address runoff, both fertilizer and road salt (workshops on safe snow removal to stop common practice of plowing excess roadway snows into ephemeral streams that flow straight into lakes) https://www.mmsd.com/what-we-do/green-infrastructure

in Chicago and around Lake Michigan: Midwest Grows Green 
https://midwestgrowsgreen.org/  
offers workshops on natural lawncare to reduce both fertilizer and pesticide loads

EPA grants have been given in the past to create low-cost sensors to track phosphate and nitrates in water - don't know what happened to this one:
https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.abstractDetail/abstract/8334
But the company link is still active: http://www.dtecsystems.us/envesi.html
This sensor is is being tested in China:

To reduce phosphorus / nitrates, organic farming methods to redirect water and use cover crops instead of fertilizers are still cheapest and most effective:
