Hi all - thanks for the feedback.

I have added most of the bugs your reported to [my todo list on GitHub](https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/pull/22).  I'm working hard on integrating annotations right now, so it may be a few days before I can get to anything on that list - but I'll get there eventually.

[@liz](/profile/liz) - I want to push back against what you said about map titles.  In the long term, I would love to see MapKnitter use more human-friendly map titles (i.e. "My First Map of Utah" instead of "2014-03-05-my-first-map-of-utah").  Most of the information in the title format you described above is already stored in the MapKnitter database (i.e. date_created timestamp, detailed and general location) - so if we encourage people to write human-readable titles, MapKnitter could generate map slugs in the format you recommend.

What is the rationale behind the format you described?  Is it to make maps more easily searchable?
