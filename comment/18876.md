Indeed! And please check out this page for existing projects you may be able to contribute to on UI -- as well as to be sure you're building on what people are already working on: https://publiclab.org/ui

In particular, there's some good work on the Questions UI that has some similarities -- a Card UI. 

Will there be a way to use a standard Bootstrap-compatible UI library to keep our CSS consistent and maintainable? Please also note the interest in upgrading to Bootstrap 4 -- https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1716 -- a big project! I'm not familiar with the Card ui abilities of Bootstrap -- I'd love to see this fleshed out a bit to reassure folks that this code will be very maintainable!
