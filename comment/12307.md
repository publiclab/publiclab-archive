Hi, did you get the ov5647 spectral response?.  I'm really interested in your project because I'm doing something similar but with an Aptina AR0130 that has a know spectral response.  The aim of the project is create a open source multispectral camera for UAVs. You could see more details in: https://hackaday.io/project/6386-usensecam
