The graph is wonderful and would be very informative if one could be confident of the story it tells. In all cases of use of particle counters one has to ask how the process gets from counts to concentrations. The methodology used here is quite questionable and no attempt has been made to validate it. In addition there is the question of the appropriateness of comparing 10 minute counts (translated into concentrations) to epa standards that are 24 hour averages and/or yearly averages. (Actually they are more complex than even this.) I applaud this citizen attempt and say this as hopefully constructive and informative criticism.
