Yes, I figured that was the case but wanted to make sure that person's response was captured here. 

Have you seen these longer masks that go down to the shoulders? I'd imagine they might get quite warm, but they'd probably be pretty easy to produce. I saw them as an ad on a Times of Israel article about masks: https://www.rosesunny.com/collections/recommendations?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8Ob-7O-B6QIVzqV-Ch2ymgNBEAEYASAAEgJ9xPD_BwE
