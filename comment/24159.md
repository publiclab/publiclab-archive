 The NDVI result will be the same whether you use one or more layers of filter. Using two layers reduces the amount of light reaching the sensor twice as much as using one layer and requires exposures that are longer (or wider aperture). There is no advantage to using two layers.

The preset awb_modes will not produce meaningful NDVI results. The sensor in this and other cameras is much less sensitive to NIR than to visible light. To take photos that capture the proportion of red light to NIR light in the actual scene, you can use a custom white balance setting that exaggerates the amount of NIR light arriving at the sensor. The Picamera does not allow custom white balance, but it does have awb_gains. Awb_gains can be used to exaggerate either the red or blue channel relative to the other. The blue channel will capture NIR (using a red filter), so you want to use awb_gains to amplify the blue channel. Don't forget to disable auto white balance by setting  awb_modes to "off."

Maybe someone has found a good setting for awb_gains that works for NDVI. You are looking for a setting that will produce a photo of a healthy green plant leaf in sunlight with about three times more NIR (blue channel) than red (red channel).
