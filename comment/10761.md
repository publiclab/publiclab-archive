Welcome Aboard [@smathermather](/profile/smathermather)!!!  I was just recommending OpenDroneMap to the [@uaviators](/profile/uaviators) people, so I'm happy to see you set up a research note.
   I'm finally at a point in my own [UAV project](http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/08-05-2014/aerial-mapping-drone-for-under-60) where I can start playing around with different mission planner GUIs, and I was thinking about whether or not it would make sense to integrate Mission Planning with the post-processing tools.  Especially, in future applications when it might be possible to crowdsource aerial imagery by requesting a certain resolution/time of/year/weather condition etc...
  I was picturing a workflow that would begin with a broad area scan by a fixed-wing UAV, and when additional areas of needed detail are highlighted in post-processing, the coordinates could be automatically uploaded to a quadrotor or another vehicle with more precise navigational capabilities.

  One of the reasons I stick with an ancient electronics codebase like MultiWii, is the Mission Planner can be run out of the [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/).  In theory, this means it should be relatively easy to add in libraries like OpenCV  or [iGeo](http://igeo.jp/) while the final program can then be exported into Javascript, Python, Android, Arduino or the default Java.

  Have you tried running any part of the ODM toolchain in Processing?  If not, would it be compatible with any of the formats Processing can output?
