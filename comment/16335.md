I don't know how low the voltage has to get before the Riffle starts to misbehave. [@Donblair](/profile/Donblair) designated the 3.5v to 6v range, so he must have based that on something derived from truthiness. There must be a similar range for the lithium battery circuit. I don't know why one has a range and the other does not. 

Three fresh alkaline AA or AAA can provide 4.5v or a little more. Some NiMH rechargeables are 1.3v apiece, so three fresh ones would provide at least 3.9v. I don't know how sensitive the Riffle lithium circuit is to greater than 3.7v. I'm sure Don has some related wisdom.

It might be a *critical safety issue* that alkaline batteries should not be on a circuit that can provide charging power back to the batteries when the Riffle is plugged into USB power. You will have to *promise* never to plug in the USB cable when something other than the appropriate rechargeable battery is on that circuit. 

I think that is a good assumption that starting with 6v (the top of the range) will provide greater endurance than staring in the middle of the range, all other things being equal. But 
lithium is not really equal to alkaline or NIMH. The battery chemistries differ in their ability to hold a charge when not in use (e.g., when the Riffle is sleeping during long deployments).

I have a few nice battery cases for four AA, so I added them at the KAPtery. You can now buy a [case and three male-female pairs of JST connectors](http://kaptery.com/product/jst-ph-2pin-connectors) for $9.00 delivered. The case has an on/off switch.
