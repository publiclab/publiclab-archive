Hi, thanks.  I read through this article, it implies that any DVD could be used, assuming it is splitable.  But it doesn't specifically state if there is some property of DVD-R that a DVD (non -R) doesn't have. 

My question is better phrased, is there some property that a DVD doesn't have that makes it unsuitable.

I split two DVD's I had, and they separated awesomely, the aluminum was on the top, the bottom was relatively clean of aluminum.

However, the bottom was not purple, like the one I got in my kit.  So that is why I started looking at using some old DVD's I had.

I'm gonna have to go get some DVD-R if that is a specific requirement. 

I see below that someone said a CD could be used, and it might have better line width.  So I have a lot of old CDs.  As long as they are splitable, do you all know if they would then be usable, assuming the aluminum sperates as needed.

Thanks in advance, looking forward to this project.
