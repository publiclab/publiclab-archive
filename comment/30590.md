Tilapia is an inexpensive, commonly consumed fish that is farmed all over the world. It is a lean source of protein that is also high in several vitamins and minerals, such as selenium, vitamin B12, niacin and potassium. 
What is Tilapia? It's a common myth that the species is “man-made”—but that couldn't be farther from the truth. While Tilapia is often raised in fish farms around the globe, the species is native to the Middle East and Africa.
Where Does Tilapia Come From? Although tilapia hails from Africa, its surge in popularity has led to the development of commercial tilapia farms around the world. Over 135 countries, including the United States, produce farm-raised tilapia in indoor recirculating tanks, ponds, freshwater net pens, and raceways. Fish is one of the healthiest sources of protein, and tilapia is no exception. Tilapia is packed with vitamins and minerals like choline, niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin D, selenium, and phosphorus. It is also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are healthy fats that your body needs to function.
