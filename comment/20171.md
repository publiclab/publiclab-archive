Hi, I just would like to share a bit of work I did here:
https://publiclab.org/notes/mprof9/11-07-2017/low-cost-sensor-for-air-quality-monitoring
It is a home made VOC measuring system based on Arduino and a Figaro gas sensor.
There are a few comparisons with parallel official measurements made by the Regional Environmental Agency in a different location a few km away.
The main use is to monitor the ambient air especially during the winter when lots of wood stoves are running in my area for domestic heating. An automatic system for the opening of windows is linked to this VOC monitoring device, so that when the air is cleaner during the day windows open to refresh the indoor air.
Calibration of the sensor is still an open question of course and I am willing to get to some solution hopefully also by sharing with this community.
Thanks for reading.
Mauro
