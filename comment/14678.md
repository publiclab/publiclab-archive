You do have a rye sense of humor, Chris.
A groan is my highest compliment. Some people prefer laughs, but I'm a groan man.

Did you just tape the PVC tube to the end of the segment? Or is it slid over the end, then taped in place? Can't really tell from photo. 

I'm trying to think of an easy way to mount the PVC 180-degrees from that configuration, so it comes back toward the user. That way when close to vertical, it's not having to bend around so far, allowing you to use less of the tubing. I don't want to take over this post on such a fussy detail of design.

Very interesting ideas on oblique v. vertical use cases. With tiny cameras, such as mobius, might be worth flying multiple to capture straight-down and obliques for such a case. 

Great article
