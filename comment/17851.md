Question for [@stoft](/profile/stoft). According to my measurements, the CMOS sensor has some sort of blooming effect before saturation. I tested my webcam with white LEDs, Look images with almost saturated condition and with 5 times lower light. White graph is sum of RGB signal. These efect is not because of sensor nonlinearity. On top of first graph you have picture stripe from which I take 100 lines, so y aksis is in 100 x bits.
Because of that you get pik or hole in spectrum, depend on light intensity.

How do you eliminate that efect
