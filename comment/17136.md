I think the answers to your latest questions depend a lot on the sfm software you will be using. Some online services don't use GPS data, so it won't help to have it. A good first step might be to learn how to take the kind of photos which produce 3D models with adequate coverage and resolution. Without getting GPS involved, you can create models which will tell you what kinds of things you could learn from them. You will also learn how many photos are needed and therefore how large a study site can be included in a single model (also depends on the software). You could also take photos with a phone to see how the quality compares to a better camera (but first figure out how to export the phone photos so that they have GPS data in the exif headers).

Your decisions will also depend on whether you will need to fly the camera vs holding it on a pole or hand-holding it. Even putting a camera on a pole involves some risk of damage (especially around sand and rocks and saltwater). If you don't need to fly the camera, you could consider investing more in it. 

For a serious research project, you will probably eventually settle on either using a good camera with GPS or using high end software (e.g., Agisoft Photoscan). You probably should use both. Combining photos which have GPS data with software that knows what to do with both photo GPS and GCPs will allow the most flexibility. Standalone software like Photoscan requires a big computer if you want to make models with 200 or more photos.

Another variable is how many different sites you will model. If you want to do 30 different sites, having GPS in the camera could eliminate the need to place and locate GCPs -- just show up at a site and start taking photos. Without GCPs, there will be (a little bit?) more uncertainty about the dimensions in the models, but depending on the type of analysis you are doing that might not make any difference in your results.

Below is an example of an extensive 3D model made from kite photos. Just so you know what is possible.
