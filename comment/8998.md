That sure would be amazing if all we had to do was take a picture with the iPads the students are using to get coordinates!  But my guess is we would still need a GPS chip to get an EXIF tag and the Wifi-only iPads have no embedded GPS module as far as I know.  We actually used an old iPod touch for our initial KAP experiments so I'll see if I can get accurate EXIF data out of it to see if it works.  If not, I'm wondering what the next best geotagging method might be?  Right now the students are using some old Garmin units to take a reading and enter the coordinates manually.  I have all kinds of Arduino-compatible GPS modules handy and I figured I could rig up a few DIY geotaggers, but the (non-jailbreakable) iPads would pretty much rule out any connections outside of Bluetooth. Somehow, I don't see the equation of  "tidal mud flats" + "serial port comms"+ "bluetooth pairing requests" as amounting to anything but frustration.
  That would be amazing if we had to take a picture of the iPad entry with an Android phone just to get the geocoordinates!  Though I imagine it wouldn't help my reputation for being a Linux snob...
