Hello [@warren](/profile/warren)   please have a look at the code to the proposed changes https://github.com/Forchapeatl/infragram/pull/1/commits

infragram/src/dist/infragram.js

        pScale = gl.getUniformLocation(ctx.shaderProgram, "uScale");
        gl.uniform2fv(pScale,scale);

The WebGl Texture will be scaled inversely proportional to the video resolution. Hence our image size is preserved.

            **HD Resolution**

                       <canvas class="fullscreen" id="image" width="4600" height="3500"></canvas>

            **QVGA**

                       <canvas class="fullscreen" id="image" width="320" height="240"></canvas>

Problem is higher (8K) resolutions enlarge the webcam texture hence utilizing a lot of GPU resources. It may hinder  performance on some devices. I'm currently brainstorming for an optimal solution.
