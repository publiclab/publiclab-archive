Thanks for replying...well by my house there is a new wasting management plant and so I am afraid the water from my well can be contaminated by hydrocarbons or other contaminants, like metals (mercury..) and so on.....is the riffle enough to test my water?? I already bought the spectometr but I am not so much good at using it.
Best Regards
