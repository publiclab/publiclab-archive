Thank you! [@warren](/profile/warren) 

Yes, the new inserts comes at the end of the editor toolbar.

I'm going to add zoom level to the map, and also going to update my proposal with how the bug documenting will be done.

Making an Editor-specific  "report a bug and document it well" issue is an awesome idea too.

Thank you again!!
