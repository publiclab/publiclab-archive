Oh, cool -- this page (https://www.epa.gov/enviro/envirofacts-data-service-api) shows this type of query, starting with a zip code prefix:

https://iaspub.epa.gov/enviro/efservice/tri_facility/zip_code/BEGINNING/0290/JSON

...for facilities in zip codes starting with `0290_` for example. That shows 86 facilities.
