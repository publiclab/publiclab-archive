I had a quick look and noticed we don't maintain wikis for any of the PL repositories. Any opinion for or against using Github wikis? 

A README is great but most times it's just enough while a wiki can provide a clear point of entry for users as well as developers. Github wikis are powered by [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki) (I think) which means they're git repositories themselves and thus provide a way for non-devs to learn git if they're so inclined. 

I mention this because I'm going to clone infragram-js and build it. Naturally I'll create a document for myself and anyone else interested. Maybe that's a starting point for an infragram wiki? 

Another helpful document for on-boarding folks would be something that covers 'best practices' for working collaboratively with git. (Correction: there's [this](http://publiclab.org/wiki/contributing-to-public-lab-software) and [this](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) courtesy of Justin).

[Snowplow](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki) is a good example of what you can do with a Github wiki. Overall I think it's an effective way to draw others in and I believe there's no cost so long as it's open source. Access can be controlled in similar way as for any pull request.   

Thanks to Justin for the head's up.
