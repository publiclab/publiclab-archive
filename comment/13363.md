based on [@gvillasenor](/profile/gvillasenor) work I found laying on the desk, got idea for simple lens/camera protection.
Using a solo cup (jello shot sized), I cut a square hole out of the bottom, then used some foam tape from our pole kit supplies. Into the foam tape, cut a small "X" then stick the X directly over the square hole, with x to the corners.

then stuck the lens through the foam tape, and it popped cleanly through. 
Note: the adhesive is not what keeps the cup attached, but rather the force of the lens pressing out on the foam.
