This came in from Molly Jacobs, Environmental Health Initiative Project Manager at the Lowell Center for Sustainable Production:

 Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) fact sheets on the air toxics described. ATSDR hasn’t put out a fact sheet on isopropanol (mostly because the health impacts are mostly of concern to workers, not those residing near factories using/emitting this substance); yet provided a NJ fact sheet on this chemical.

There are known health effects, some of these chemicals are more problematic than others.  What we don’t know is the health effects associated with the mixture of substances. However, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified air pollution (the complex mixture) as carcinogenic to humans: https://www.iarc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pr221_E.pdf.


Health impact fact sheets:

- Acrolein: https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=554&tid=102
- Cyclohexane: https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/PHS/PHS.asp?id=752&tid=138
- Methylene chloride: https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=233&tid=42
- Hexane: https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=391&tid=68
- Chloroform: https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/PHS/PHS.asp?id=51&tid=16
- 2-Heaxanone: https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=736&tid=134
- Isopropanol: https://www.nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/1076.pdf

I would be less worried about (unless exposed at high levels):

Ethyl Acetate (acetic acid)
Ethanol
