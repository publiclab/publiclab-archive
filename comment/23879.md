 Great fodder for thinking about.
1) Agreed, having an individual light measurement per plant has advantages in certain scenarios. I guess it comes down to experimental design and how stats analysis is planned afterwards. Taking an individual intensity measurements would add light intensity as a factor, so as long as the rest of the design and analysis manages that appropriately it would be fine.

2) This gives some good ideas for doing some data checks with flickering light sources. E.g. take a series of photos of a light source at a selected frequency, look at histogram and deviation of resulting intensities to see what the distribution is like, and how many measurements are required to get a decent average.

Re: averaging, I thought it would be easier to just average right away so there's just not copious amounts of data to deal with later, but maybe there's a way of saving the data still and also getting an average simultaneously so error checking can still happen. Or I suppose gathering all the data in hoards and processing/averaging after would still be fine as you'd still see the general result (just a bit more noisy) during the live capture.

3) Using a Solux as a portable calibrating source seems like a worthwhile effort. Adding to what you said, it'd also be good to test how the light varies in different outlets in different buildings, in case that might be a factor too. Even without a commercial device, I think a good sense of the solux's stability could be obtained by just measuring a bulb over time after turning it on, and doing that a number of times. If we assume, that the built spectrometer in question is stable, (and the light vs. spectrometer setup is extremely consistent) even if it's not fully calibrated, then the result should also be telling of the solux's stability.

Thanks
