Warren and Pushpaw, thanks a lot for the suggestions, I'm still looking at multiple things you suggested.

This is what I can confirm right now:
1. The camera itself works fine via https://spectralworkbench.org/, but only when I have the lid of the spectrometer lifted.
2. I removed the grating and the slit and just when I close the lid of the spectrometer the image becomes 100% dark.

I'll check your other suggestions and see if I can change camera settings.
