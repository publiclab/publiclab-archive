I recently got some really good feedback , and it was pointed out that my units on fig 4 were out of whack (like, where was 1E-2?), so I went back and it turns out that Numbers (Excel for Mac) didn't like how I entered the x-axis values.  So, I fixed that and the Molar Absorptivity Coefficient changed from ~2800/M*cm to ~3100/M*cm
