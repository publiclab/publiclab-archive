I was thinking that we could try to produce a false color image to show the topography (basically a DEM or digital elevation model) and then adjust the false color to be relative to the average of the four corners of each respective plot (to account for overall topography change). Then we could rectify the whole DEM to a measured grid using Photoshop or something, and calculate volume by looking at (the height of each pixel * the real-world pixel area) and summing them up for each plot. 

It's several steps but it seems like a viable way to approach biomass calculation.

Has Dorn done independent ground-based biomass measurements to compare to? I'll email him to see if he's following this thread.
