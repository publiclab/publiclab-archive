Hi MaggPi,

Thanks for your comment. Picamera has a very simple de-mosaic algorithm. The way I've been analysing the images is by load them directly from the RPi into Matlab, where I further de-mosaic them, adjust the white balance and so on. 
Here you can see an example of a raw image processed in Matlab.
I'm busy now installing opencv directly into the CM, which seems to be very straight forward but it's not. The 4GB size of the CM makes you very limited in terms of what you can install.
