p.51 has a discussion of pH and salinity on spectra: "intensities increase with higher pH until 10, as observed by Reynolds and Ahmad (1995) at raw sewage samples" -- but it's unclear how this relates to oil samples, since oil does not have pH. Maybe this'd be an issue if we used alcohol to try to dissolve samples.
