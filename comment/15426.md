I like this idea -- you're right, even 1/2 oz would be plenty. Abdul, what do you think about that as an assembly step? Would one of those "push to dispense" tops on a wood glue bottle be a pain to use to fill a few dozen or more at a time? 

We're doing a build of this at [#LEAFFEST2016](/tag/LEAFFEST2016) now... will post more soon with photos.
