Every one of the Public Lab tools could be the focus of a great classroom project. There have been attempts to create a curriculum outline for [spectrometry ](https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometer-curriculum)and [infrared photography (wetland vegetation)](https://publiclab.org/wiki/wetlands-lesson-plans). There might be some others, but I don't know how well any of these have been vetted for use. It always bothered me that people who don't know enough about a topic to create their own curriculum are the ones who end up teaching students about that topic.
