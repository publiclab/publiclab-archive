Hey Mathew - maybe you misunderstand -- I'm not speaking against a WYSIWYG editor - we've clearly agreed on Github that it's a priority, and my understanding is that we're working to dedicate some staff time towards it in the coming year. A shorter note format could definitely be WYSIWYG. 

I agree that WYSIWYG doesn't mean longer, and that we should think of length and ease of interface as separate issues. Given that we've made a WYSIWYG editor project a priority, I'm mostly interested in the question of research note length at this point. 

I do think the idea of a "plain text only" version of a post is interesting, though, for high frequency (day-to-day) or first-time posters. What do you think of that concept?
