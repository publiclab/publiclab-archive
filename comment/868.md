cool - well we're using webcams in our spectrometers, but the spectroscope you mention is paired with a camera that's taking a long exposure, right? It's harder to extract data automatically from a still camera, but the ability to do a long exposure is a big plus. My main problem at this point is that the amount of fluorescent light generated by the laser is not a lot for the small webcams we're using. 

Typically we've been using halogen, tungsten, or other full-spectrum lights:

but it's much easier to separate the signal from the source light with a laser, so I was interested to try. 

Personally i'm not trying to measure chlorophyll but just doing tests and eventually trying to detect polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from oil spill contamination. So this is kind of a stepping stone, but it was neat to see some high-end data to compare to.

Thanks!
