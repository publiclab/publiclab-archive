 Three more optional suggestions:
If you were a GCI mentor please mention it in your proposal. We will give extra credit to these long term collaborators.
Second, it will be great to have a conference or seminar at your university about Public Lab and the programs which are held here. It is optional. No compulsion at all.
Thirdly, help each other in writing their proposals by giving suggestions under the proposals.
