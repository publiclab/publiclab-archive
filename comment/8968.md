Hi J,
I used razor blades just because that's what I had available. I think a laser cut slit would work well if you can cut a narrow enough slit. Ideally, I believe, you would want the slit width to be about one or two times the width of one of the pixels on the PDA. As far as buying a 2048 pixel sensor, I got a Toshiba tcd1201d from Ebay for about $4.
