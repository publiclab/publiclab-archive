This is great. The vintage timers are pretty amazing although they add a lot of weight and thus money and are not tamper proof. We could just include one of these 4 dollar timers. as the next best thing. http://restauranttory.com/taylor-58-5842-58-mini-digital-timer-36200-minimum-order.asp?gclid=CJWEj-fTusUCFUwXHwodMU0A-Q

I bet our calibration could last for at least 5 tests. having people pass them along to the next person (for a set batch) as opposed to sending them back and forth would save a ton of money on postage and personal shipping time. 

when we use the mini buck to calibrate we can see how many tests each calibration can hold. setting a time/test duration is a pretty standard. 

if in the long run we could hardwire our own timer that would be ideal
