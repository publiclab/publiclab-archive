Thanks for sharing your views. I believe the exposure issue can be fixed by using High Dynamic Range or HDR technique. I'm not a photography expert but I understand that what this technique does is take one image with "normal" exposure, one with underexposure and another with overexposure, then merges the three images into a single one. I know my iPhone has that feature and my DSLR camera can also do it to a more sophisticated level allowing you to set how many levels of under and over exposure you want. I don't know of any webcam software that can do this (I haven't checked thoroughly) but ill try with my iPhone first to see if the merged image is better than a normal photo. I need to tweak the spectrometer to use it with my phone but that shouldn't be an issue. I'll keep you posted. As for the slit width, I don't have the tools to make one that improves the one I made out of black cardboard. I've thought about making an adjustable slit by using two blades (razor blades painted black) and closing them together somehow (still have to figure how that will work.)
