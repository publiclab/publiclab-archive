 [@DavidMack](/profile/DavidMack) wow, and that is even without interference from acetaldehyde & acetone etc? 

The article we developed our method from, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23278296, found in laboratory settings "The slope of the line between the expected formaldehyde reading and the actual formaldehyde reading was 0.998 with a standard error of 0.158 (R2=0.930)."
