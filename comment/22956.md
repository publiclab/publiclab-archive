[@warren](/profile/warren) I like how you are funneling people to where they are trying to get. I think so far my only issue is that it looks long from a scrolling perspective. I was trying to figure out a similar site that has to funnel, but so far only Instructables is coming to mind. Their sort happens on the top of their page, but they have an easier time since they've already established the person is a maker. We have makers, people that need remediation, and people that like to write/research. It makes me wonder if we can clarify by two buckets--those that wish to engage in citizen science, and those that need citsci help? It's an interesting dilemma.
