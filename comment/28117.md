yes, we had the same issue here. Very difficult to pinpoint source. However, toxins are toxins.. This is what we did: 1.we tested (soil) in nearby yards and playground to shine a light on the issue (we got some press coverage). We found elevated PAH's that were associated with the plant we were targeting (there were other potential sources too). 3.We held a press conference announcing the results and calling for a comprehensive investigation. 4. In the meantime, TCC was found guilty in criminal court. 5.. we ended up using our test results in a proposal and submitted to the judge presiding over the Tonawanda Coke guilty verdict and sentencing. 6. He funded our $711,000 soil study!
