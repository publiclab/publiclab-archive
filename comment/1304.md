That's a neat take on visualizing the location-- it would be nice to unite the color data for the test strips with the maps themselves, so instead of red dots indicating the location relative to other black dots, make each dot on the map a test strip, and make the map bigger. 

Then all the data would be in four spacially related images.  You could drop them onto  Mapknitter maps centered around the coordinates you put together in this note:
