Here’s a link to the chapter on determining sample size in an ecological study from Charles Krebs’ Ecological Methodologies textbook: https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~krebs/downloads/krebs_chapter_07_2017.pdf

He walks the reader through a couple of standard options for how to figure this out based on the requirements you have for your results. He also provides an option near the end of the chapter for if none of the standard ways work for your study. 

There are also sample size calculators available on the internet, but I think the problem you might run into with those is knowing how big your population size should be.
