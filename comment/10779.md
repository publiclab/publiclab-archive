Hi gpenzo, I read all your articles and would like to know if you have completed your work. Do you had better results with the filter 850 or 720? What software did you use for processing? I am building my drone and also will not use Gimbal to increase the autonomy of flight, any comments? I intend to use two Canon SX230 HS.

Thank you
