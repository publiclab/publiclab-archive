Hi Chris, thanks again!

Which are the surfaces that reflect both blue and NIR light? Could you give me some examples?

And about mobius camera, i read that it does a custom white balance and the file "SYSCFG.TXT" contains fixed gains for RGB colors ("Customized White Balance 1 Red Gain=[310],Green Gain=[500],Blue Gain=[700];"). Should I change those gains for different lighting conditions?
I still don't understand very well if I have to calibrate the images with mobius camera or if I can just fix the gains at "SYSCFG.TXT".

Carol
