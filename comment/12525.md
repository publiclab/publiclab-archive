Hi [@ajawitz](/profile/ajawitz),

Do you happen to have a binary dump of the EEPROM that's on the Radio Shack pocket IR thermometer? My unit is spitting out an "Er 5" error. Among the minimal information available online about this error, it appears to indicate that the EEPROM is corrupt.

Thanks!
