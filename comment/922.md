Given the fact that i have just heard of the raspberry pi i am not too sure. Ideally what i would like is something that can process the spectrum, determine chemical concentrations and then store the data.

I expect that it will be a fairly long road to achieve that. You have to aim high though :) I am still not entirely sure how to apply the data provided in some of the links you provided for element spectrum.
