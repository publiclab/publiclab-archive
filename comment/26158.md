Check with the individual sampling tubes for airflow requirements.  

Most manufacturers also sell hand pumps, that can be used to sample the air relatively inexpensively.

If you want to measure flow, in gc, we used bubble flow meters.  These are easy, cheap, and relatively accurate.  They take a stopwatch and calibrated volume. 

Can't help you with the pump mechanism.
