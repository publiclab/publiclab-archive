The paints are for making consistent whites and greys that will be the same perceptual color across a wide variety of lighting conditions. They are frequently used for white balancing in broadcast settings.

 I've never seen spectra for these paints, but I've worked with them commercially on TV sets.  The idea that they'd have a flat spectral response is a guess-- these paints exist precisely because commercial wall paint looks so varied in different lighting.
