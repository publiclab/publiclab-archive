 Thanks Liz!!! Hopefully we will capture the urban rooftop growing too, it will also be very interesting to compare to Shenzhen in future. The five borough project looks amazing! The toolkit is really interesting to me - and useful - especially for the community gardens as it's so important to track their impact. I will mention your project when presenting at the urban growers/food festival in Notts in June! Great work, thanks for sharing!
