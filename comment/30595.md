If you want an overview of TOC, Wikipedia is a good start.  The current article seems pretty thorough ( dated 19 July 2022 by 75.143.92.215). Any carbon compound in solution are oxidized to  carbon dioxide by several possible methods.  The one that is most lab friendly is UV oxidation(often with a 254 nm. lamp) , usually with persulfate oxidizer, but sometimes with straight dissolved oxygen.
