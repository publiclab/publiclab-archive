Thank you so much [@warren](/profile/warren) . I sincerely do appreciate your review on the front page. Yes,  localStorage will be a great option to achieve this, whereby the src value of the image will be stored using the localStorage.SetItem() from the front page, which will automatically redirect to the sandbox page displaying the image gotten from the localStorage.getItem() property ready for further analysis. 

 For a first-timer, the welcome modal box would serve as a basic instruction and guidelines on using the page, which will also clearly cover the 'edit' icon and usage.

Oh, okay. about the tool panel, I designed that just to maintain the UI pattern irrespective of the screen size (keeping in mind the same flow for mobile devices)should have the same design flow. though having the tool panel open automatically for a higher screen size would be a great idea too(thank you for pointing that out).

I'll be making more adjustments to this design and the sandbox page!. [@warren](/profile/warren) thank you once again for the feedback .
