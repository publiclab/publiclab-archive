You got it right Ned. I am trying to calibrate the image using a reference target before you calculate NDVI.
Suppose, I have 3 target reference panels of reflectance 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 for red band.

Now need to calculate reflectance of red band from pixel value of image using these target panels. There would be some linear equation with gain and offset. So, what this equation would be, and how to determine the gain and offset?

I'm using drone to capture images.

It would be great if you can also give reference of study material, I couldn't find anything related.

Thank You
