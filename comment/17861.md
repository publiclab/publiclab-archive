The camera's I've used seem different in this effect but you might try to hunt down the technical data sheets from the Mfg -- sometimes they have additional information. I did test a monochrome 'webcam' (see Research Note) but it did not offer a cure-all solution. That is not to say that a good quality monochrome camera would not do much better. I was under the impression, from what the Mfg told me, that the monochrome camera I tried was not just an RGB, but a true monochrome. I tend to believe it as the sensitivity and adjustments were different.The internal camera firmware _can_ have a number of control features (as opposed to just one setting) so care is needed to really know what the control(s) is(are) doing -- the combined effect can require experimentation to find the right trade-offs. The following PLab notes might be of interest: https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/05-17-2014/plab-s-webcam-non-linearity, https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/10-23-2016/high-rez-webcam-spectrometers, and https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/03-09-2014/hdr2-using-over-exposure-to-your-advantage. If I had to choose a simple webcam with good price/performance ratio, out of the limited number I've measured, I'd suggest the OVA-2710 from Amazon for about $45 with an 8mm M12 lens $8.
