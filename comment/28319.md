For good ideas on fixing erosion, read "Let The Water Do The Work" by Bill Zeedyk and Van Clothier. Zeedyk spent 30 years with the Forest Service fighting erosion the wrong way, he says. He then retired and started looking at how nature really works. He found that one can mimic nature's own way and thereby reverse erosion in many cases.
