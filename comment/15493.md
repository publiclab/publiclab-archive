Just another note here -- starting to look for someone interested in [creating an activity](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-17-2016/what-makes-a-good-activity) out of a [beer's law demonstration](https://publiclab.org/notes/straylight/05-13-2013/using-the-spectroscope-for-analysis-of-concentration-beer-s-law) -- for determining concentration of a solution.
