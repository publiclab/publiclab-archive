Here's that picture of the pendulum with the carabiner wrapped around one end:

[![IMG_1326.JPG](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/352/large/IMG_1326.JPG)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/352/original/IMG_1326.JPG)

I started wrapping the line around the carabiner, which I now realize made it more difficult to wrap it around the rest of the wire. If I had started on the left side first, I could have wrapped the line all the way across the wire and around the carabiner last.
