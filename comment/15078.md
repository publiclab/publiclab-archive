Here's that picture of the pendulum with the carabiner wrapped around one end:

I started wrapping the line around the carabiner, which I now realize made it more difficult to wrap it around the rest of the wire. If I had started on the left side first, I could have wrapped the line all the way across the wire and around the carabiner last.
