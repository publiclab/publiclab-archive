From [@ottinger](/profile/ottinger) on the air quality list: "In terms of the ways they do and don't work, what I've seen from airwatchbayarea and the iWitness Map: they work best when there's active organizing to encourage people to make reports, and when the overall reporting strategy is connected to a larger campaign and campaign goals."
