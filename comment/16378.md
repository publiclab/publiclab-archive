in terms of jeff's questions: I'm not sure I understand the bell jar totally. I think a month is a good time for a test, to minimize illusory short-term changes. i think [@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2) might have some nice ideas about housing. and i think [@kkoerner](/profile/kkoerner) did some nice research on other pumps
