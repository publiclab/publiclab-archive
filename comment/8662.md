Silica monitoring is definitely a use case especially where a point source (concrete aggregate plant?) is already identified. I also think that a coal train monitor, where the data logger is triggered by on board noise sensor would be a neat application. 

I worked up a blog post after contacting one of the contributing scientists. It includes some of the limitations and unknowns associated with the shenyei:
