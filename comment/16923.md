I strongly echo everything Chris said - and honestly, we'd really love to give your work more exposure -- I wonder if even simply posting a lot of the content you've already put together (and linked to/summarized in this thread) in separate posts could be a first step. I'm happy to help get this done, if you're interested! This comment thread is getting really long and all your work deserves more prominence on the site!
