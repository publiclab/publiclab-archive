Hi [@warren](/profile/warren) 

1.) I tried very hard to use the Twitter API and twitter gem to directly tweet .  
But it seems they have depreciated the API to post images with tweets , only we can `tweet text without image` . 

I even asked for help here [https://github.com/sferik/twitter/issues/638](https://github.com/sferik/twitter/issues/638#issuecomment-359882734) and  tried the solution given by some good folks in that issue comments but still no luck . I will try some alternatives to post images as well in the next week .

Also you once said here : [when we solved this tricky IFTTT issue :-)](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1958#issuecomment-360545797) that you don't liked the idea of baking new channels of publication into our core code , which makes total sense .

The best solution and the fastest solution i think is just to update the tweets generated from RSS feeds to start with the `node-id` , for example : 

_Tweet-`15850` via Ag8n: http://ift.tt/2FJ8tlw  The difference between medical particle monitoring and your particle monitoring?_


1.1) We can quickly parse `15850` and search in our Node-database and add power tag                     `twitter:XXXXX` (here XXXXX is the tweet-id) . 

1.2) Similarly when someone comment on the any tweet , we fetch this comment => then calculate the parent using
 `parent =  client.status(i.in_reply_to_status_id)  where i = comment object`  and then using again the 
`node-id = 15850 which is in parent.title` we can add this comment to our Comment database .

1.3) Now for adding comments from PublicLab to Corresponding tweet (this is exciting !) , we can simply use the Power-Tag `twitter:XXXXX` and `Client.update( body of comment , reply_to: XXXXX)` we can post the comment on that Tweet . 

----------------------- 

2.) Why 10 minutes ? 

Actually i have hosted the demo website on Heroku and scheduler used is Heroku-scheduler which has minimum running time of 10 minutes . 
But we will use the [Whenever gem](https://github.com/javan/whenever) , which can even run after every 1 minute ! [@namangupta](/profile/namangupta) mentioned whenever gem documentation in his proposal [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/namangupta/02-17-2018/gsoc-proposal) .

3.) And [@warren](/profile/warren)  , [@liz](/profile/liz) , [@stevie](/profile/stevie) , please check the demo and let me know if anything needs to be added / modified . 

Thank so much for feedback ! 

[@namangupta](/profile/namangupta) , [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano) , [@vidit](/profile/vidit) what do you all think about this ? Thanks !
