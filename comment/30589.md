     The relationship between Tilapia fish and farm raised Catfish is mutual. Tilapias are mid-level tank feeders while Catfish are bottom feeders. This means that the fishes will clean parts of the tank that the other wouldnâ€™t creating a clean environment for both species. Tilapia and Catfish equally benefit from being in the same environment with one another. *Gianna Williams*
