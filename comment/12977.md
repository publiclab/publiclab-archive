Very cool, Chris!
Thanks for the ideas on this.

I still think my method is a bit fussy for public consumption, as it requires some dexterity to get the knots just right. ideally, the method would be simple to use and not hinge on a knot being executed perfectly to keep the think from falling.

I was playing with another idea, using a pair of zip ties, one actually suspending the camera, and the other sliding over to lock it in place.. The tail end can be secured by friction to a dowel, using a bit of tubing. I added a tack to make darn sure.

Then Chris' point that you really don't need much to protect the mobius other than something to keep the lens out of the dirt made me think I could get rid of the bottle, and just make a tight sleeve to both protect the lens on impact, and keep the main zip tie from sliding out of position and dropping the camera. 

And here's the result:

A sleeve of plastic/vinyl of the right diameter could replace the DIY version in a kit, as long as it fit snugly and could slide on/off without getting too loose over time.
