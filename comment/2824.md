Brent,

It might be that you need to adjust the alignment of the camera.  The relationship among the slit, the grating, and the camera is critical to get an image of the spectrum projected precisely into the camera's lens. 

It looks like you are viewing the live video image from the webcam. While doing that, just reorient the camera (with grating attached) until the spectrum is centered in the image and the lines are vertical. Make sure you are viewing the brightest spectrum and not a dimmer secondary spectrum. When you get a clear, tidy image, lock down that orientation and you should be ready to go. If you can find no image of a spectrum, maybe the grating  (DVD) is positioned incorrectly.

You can also post at the plots-spectrometry Google group where more experienced people might be able to help.
