Hey [@BSweet](/profile/BSweet) yeah, this place has a lot of ways to engage, so take your time. :) Anyway, under "Get Involved" you can click on "Join the Discussions" to be added to the lists you think would be helpful. Also, on Tuesdays anyone can take part in a Public Lab video conf./call (click "Meet People" under "Get Involved". Finally, the themed Open Call I was talking about may happen in February--that's the one I think you should attend. I'll give you a shout if it happens. Glad you discovered this community since air quality is a huge issue.
