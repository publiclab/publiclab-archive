Unfortunately the web based [spectralworkbench.org](http://spectralworkbench.org) hasn't been modified to work with the raspberry pi camera yet, as it's going to be a bit complicated. But you can download software from the [#pi-builder](/tag/pi-builder) project to access the camera via WiFi and download the image, then switch networks to upload it again to the website... Not ideal but it will definitely work.&nbsp;
  

If folks are interested we may be starting a project soon to try to get the pi camera running in a more integrated way with the online software. We wish pi cameras could be set up to run as a normal USB webcam but nobody's figured that out yet! There is theoretically a way with "Linux gadget mode" that's been explored but I've never seen it successfully implemented. In the meantime the best next step to smooth the process may be to get the raspberry pi to join the same WiFi network and connect to it that way, OR to get spectral workbench running on the pi itself, but then people will be less able to connect to the rest of the spectral workbench database because the pi won't be connected to the broader internet. Oof.&nbsp;

  

Thanks for your interest though! The "download, switch WiFi network, upload" workflow is the best way for the time being, I think.&nbsp;

> I apologize if this is the incorrect forum, if so please point me in the right direction. We assembled raspberry pi lego spectrometer using the Pi NoIR Camera Module V2. We installed the latest version of Raspbian. The camera works fine with picamera. Our browsers (chromium and firefox) are both set to allow camera access. When we run web based spectralworkbench it indicates it is still awaiting camera access. We downloaded spectral workbench.py and have been unable to get that to work. Any suggestions would be much appreciated thanks
