Thaks, Jeff. 
I'll try to use a wooden block with a hole in it, or made with pieces to allow the cable to pass. I'll keep distance and height from the lens to the slit.

What about the 45ยบ and 60ยบ degrees for the camera and the DVD of v3.0? Why do you suggest to leave it as it is already mounted? Not as important?
