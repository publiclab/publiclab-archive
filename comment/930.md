Matthew, that is great, thanks. I did not know how to attach documents to the post yet.

I've changed the 200 mm error in the script comments. 

Also note that you can replace my commercial message on the GCP's with anything you want by altering the line 

 text("jasjavliegt.nl ", 40,330); 

The text between " " is the text that is printed.
