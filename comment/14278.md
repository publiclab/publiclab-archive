Hi,
1) unluckily I don't have access to a spectrometer
2) wich are the companies where I can buy a cheap Calibration targets?
3) may it be fine to use, for my goals, the normal corrugated brown cardboard like one in this image as calibration target?
4) If my corrugated brown cardboard is ok, I can put it in greenhouse and begin to shoot photos with the calibration target inside the images.
5) Do you think the NoIR Pi camera + red filter would be better instead of NoIR Pi camera + blue filter (Rosco # 2008) I use now?

Thank you

LaPa
