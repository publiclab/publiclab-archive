Hello I am new to the Spectral Workbench Community.  

I am having trouble saving files so I can get students to do things like graph spectra in Excel. 

I read that the workbench software did have to ability to do this, but I cant figure it out, so if it does please help me figure out how to do it. If not please make a feature:

Spectra should be downloadable into something like a csv file so they can be graphed in something like Microsfot excel.

Thanks
