Hi!! 
The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) is the United Nations' body for assessing the science related to climate change.    They put out a lot of really dense research on climate change, which often includes this topic.  I think a lot of their material is hard to get through, but luckily organizations have helped to break down their results a bit! Here's a write up from the World Resources Institute on an IPCC report related to extreme weather and climate change: https://www.wri.org/blog/2011/11/five-takeaways-ipcc-report-extreme-weather-and-climate-change

The above is an older piece, but can give you an idea on topic. 

Check out this recent piece as well. It's long but has good graphics and resources: https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world
