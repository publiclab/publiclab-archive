Thanks, Chris, for the encouraging feedback. A lot of thought went into this, and although in the first version you stretched *your* spectrum, it was easier to do it this way because:

* here we don't need to move both the graph and the image, so it's smoother (less CPU)
* here the thing you stretch is at the top, and there's no inclination to put the example reference **between** the spectrum and its graph
* the eye more easily distinguishes color order and balance in the image than in the graph, in my opinion
* a graph line would've **overlapped** other graph lines, rather than been placed alongside, which I thought would be visually more confusing (i.e. what's "on top"? which line is which?)
* this is also a good opportunity to show folks what a really nice image **should** look like, so they can aim for that

I'd like to use your polynomial calibration, but without having an actual spectrum image which has been corrected, we can't show the user such an example. Do you know of one? Eventually, we should write a calibration function that can do that too -- actually irregularly stretch the image and corresponding data with as many control points as needed -- kind of like image warping with GCPs. I've modularized the calibration code to accommodate this in the future, but it's a big project. Actually, the whole ToolPane system is something designed so that other folks can publish their own ToolPanes (like different calibration methods) as user-generated utilities. That'll be covered in the upcoming API reference in the wiki. 

The RMSE 'fitness' function, however, can be used with numerical data, so if you can publish your polynomial calibration as a CSV, I'd love to use it.   

For starters, I'd like to use a more precisely calibrated image reference. I need an image with the following dimensions:

* overall image pixel width (1818px in the current image)
* distance in pixels to (middle) 436.6nm blue line from left edge of image (586px in current)
* distance in pixels between blue and (second) 546.5nm green line (538px in current)

These are used in the procedure here: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/spectralworkbench/SpectralWorkbench.UI.ToolPaneTypes.js#L310

How was the interface speed on your computer? I am hoping to optimize it to speed things up, but was it usable?
