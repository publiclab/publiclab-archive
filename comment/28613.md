[@JorgeHM](/profile/JorgeHM), how is the connecting of the camera lens to the circuitboard? I've gotten this error before when that was loose. to check this, you'll need to remove the camera circuit board from the white side of the case. Connected to the camera lens by a small ribbon is a black box that snaps onto the circuitboard. See if that black box is tightly connected or wiggly, you want it to be snug.
