The video goes over some new information about microplastics. 75% of the planet's surface is covered in water, and of that 75% only 3% is fresh water. Despite out dependency on fresh water for survival, we still dump thousands of tons of microplastics into our lakes and rivers each year. Microplastics also affect bodies such as the great lakes. The only difference is that these lakes cannot gather the plastics into one place like oceans can with garbage patches. This means that the thousands of tons of plastic in these lakes are at the bottom or on the shoreline.
