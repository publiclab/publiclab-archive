Yes!  Very interested!  Brief history: I was a scientist (hydrogeology and geochemistry with a background in marine ecology and microbiology) for 15 years before become and educator for 25.  My partner and I just retired and will be spending much of our time on a sailboat.  I would love a way to collect data for and find additional ways to support citizen science initiatives.  I have a Baby Legs monitoring kit and have wondered about collecting daily samples.  It would be great to be able to share that data!
