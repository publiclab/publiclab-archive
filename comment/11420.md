This is very exciting to see - we'd very early on tried to get a Raspberry Pi dual cam system working: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-17-2012/prototype-raspberry-pi-based-dual-ir-cam

And had also looked at the form factor of dual lens reflex cameras, like the Rolleiflex:

Yours looks so great! I'm also curious; how long does it take to boot up? I'm looking at making a single camera setup with a Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone soon, and want to know how close to a "regular camera" the boot sequence would be.
