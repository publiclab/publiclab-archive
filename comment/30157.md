Thank you for the detailed feedback and suggestions [@warren](/profile/warren) 
I have been able to achieve an edge-to-edge workspace for the images using bootstrap container-fluid and giving the work-space height and width 100% sizes each. The container fluid however comes with a default padding left and right which I removed with bootstrap styling p-0. These helped remove the extra spaces around the uploaded image. I also set the image position to fix, to remove the previous scrollable behavior.

All of these can be seen in the updated code mockups and visual mockups.
