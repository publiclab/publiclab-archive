RE:-High Winds-
  Has anyone posted a note about making a DIY wind speed meter?  It would've been handy to get a rough idea of how close I was to the kites limits.  I tried various Android apps that claim to calculate wind speed by measuring distortion in the phone microphone, but all were completely useless when I tried them in the field...  
  There seem to be a few "DIY Anemometer" tutorials on KAP forums and Instructables but they all seem to be for full anemometers, meaning it also measures wind direction. In my case direction wasn't all that important...
  I have an old PC fan with an analog output I was considering hacking into one of those attachments for the smartphone that go in through the headphone jack, but I wanted to see if anyones tried it already.
