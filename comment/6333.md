Yipes, James! I'm so sorry i missed your comment. Yes, please send the files to jeff@publiclab.org and I'll post them -- or post them yourself on the site please! We are just adding file posting features to the new site in the next couple days. 

The final designs in any case ended up here: http://old.publiclab.org/notes/mathew/11-30-2012/final-fold-mini-spectrometer-print-files-and-instructions
