I'm new to MapKnitter and Public Lab. My first attempt at publishing failed to display the assembly of aerial photos I had stitched together because I did not understand I was required to copy and paste the text produced by clicking the Embed Code key. Once I understood, I attempted to correct my published post, pasting the requisite text into my descriptive narrative. This just made things worse. The entire text disappeared from my posting, leaving just the title and thumbnail. In the editor, all the text except the embedded code was still there. As long as I made no further attempt to embed the code, I could redisplay the text. As a workaround, I added a textual link to my MapKnitter project. 
What should I do to embed the link as an image properly?
