I'm a little familiar with PH testing for aquariums (usually strips or vials) and soil for planting (vials or sensors). What's nice is that these tools are generally very easy to find and pretty affordable (there are lots of PH measuring tools marketed to home or hobby users, so depending on whatever else you might want to be testing along with the PH there may even be an all-in-one tool available. 

I also recently came across some DIY methods, using vinegar or baking powder to test for acidity or alkaline reactions (divide into two containers, make a sludge, see what provokes a reaction)... there's even a test that relies on observed color change in water colored with red cabbage leaves. Would be interested to set some of these tests up to compare to one another!
