Yes, I must be right at the limit for voltage that the cameras can tolerate.  One of the diodes on the MK111 (D3) apparently drops the voltage from 6v to 5.5v, so we are not too far off.  The cameras seem to work fine with the new timer setup, but I still want to do some more testing (maybe with an old camera!).
