Hey fantastic to have a calibrated gas sensor as the starting point. 
It is essential to the definition of "quality" in any air quality measurement - doing the hardwork to translate the output of a raw sensor to a defined scale. In this blog Kensanfran is discussing the detail of how to do it.
I wrote about the value of calibrated scales here - (in the context of air quality and the discussion on the use of uncalibrated AQE sensors)

Nice one kensanfran
