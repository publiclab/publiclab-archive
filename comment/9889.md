Additionally, research notes do have spam buttons. You might need to be a moderator on the site to see them, though. We have a ticket about spam voting somewhere.

The few of us act as a first line of defense because sometimes so much spam shows up from a single user that it takes over the "recent notes" section, etc. It would be daunting to users unfamiliar with our site (we have new users every day) or to those some of the technically less advanced users (of which we have many). We needed a stop-gap to prevent that from happening. I believe we get emailed 30 minutes or something before the notes are released on PL proper so that we don't run into those kind of situations. It works quite well. We might miss some things in the long run, but that's where the button comes in.

As an aside, Jeff is the only developer, outside the GSoC interns and a nice fellow from New York whom none of us have ever met. Jeff is, of course, doing all kinds of other things for PL as well. There are a lot of ideas for PL software and websites but little power to get them done. PL needs to be conservative about the features it chooses to embrace, and those which will end up resulting in more work in the future than it could handle. Yes, we could do iframes. Jeff might even add it just to end this conversation. But in the long run, it creates so many more problems than it solves. And then the small team has to deal with those as well.
