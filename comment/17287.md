[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie): Thank you for your kind suggestion. 
In the early stage, we have concluded that two camera solution needs more synchronization of alignment and same focal length. So, we have to need some more research regarding single camera solution.
so, we are testing on Dual bandpass filter (http://midopt.com/filters/db660850/) which is only RED and NIR image only.
Basically, i have taken a photo using 660_850(RED_NIR) filter actually it is not a grayscale image.
when I capture the image in an indoor area it is a reddish image 
INDOOR IMAGE:
[![ind_R_N_Orginal.jpg](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/497/large/ind_R_N_Orginal.jpg)](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/497/original/ind_R_N_Orginal.jpg)

But when I'm capturing an image in open environment it image is capture like grayscale

OUTDOOR IMAGE:

Then after as per your suggestion, I have used Blue channel as NIR image.
and used algorithm:
(blue_img(NIR)-red_img)/(blue_img(NIR)+red_img): 

Original outdoor Image of 660_850 (RED_NIR) image:

Red channel image:

Blue as NIR Image: 
[![otd_im_Blue.jpg](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/501/large/otd_im_Blue.jpg)](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/501/original/otd_im_Blue.jpg)

NDVI output  image :

then after i am using algorithm.
(red_img-blue_img)/(red_img+blue_img)

then NDVI output image.

I m confusion that is it possible to process NDVI using dual bandpass filter 660_850? 
using single camera solution NDVI is possible or not?
