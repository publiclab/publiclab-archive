Thanks for sharing this read! Also interesting how community advocacy groups and activists in the Global South have filled similar intermediary role over centuries, and continue to. They are under a lot of oppression and regularly become the target of colonial governments, military, and 'for hire' assassins. Global Witness keeps an eye on this. An analysis of how these intermediary "institutions" in the Global North hold different power and varying dynamics than the realities of many would be one to be aware of as well.
