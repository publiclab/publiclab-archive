Love the distinction between successes -- success in following the steps, or in reproducing the results? The method or the tool? We could ask people posting activities to clearly state what they're looking for people to attempt, and what they'd consider success. And if they ask people to reproduce an experiment and get the same results, but haven't managed to provide enough detail in methods, someone attempting replication might say "Hey, this isn't quite ready for a replication -- we need to ensure we can replicate your build/steps, first." -- and perhaps it then needs to be broken into two activities, each asking for a different scope of result?
