It would be useful if the model of the spectrometer was included as well as a file of the win10 and the raw output of the spectrometer. it may be that your spectrometer output does not conform to the standard webcam used in spec3?. would be great if you could share the file, also was your spectrometer calibrated by manufacturer? Or was it ever calibrated?
