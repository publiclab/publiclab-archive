[@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) [@warren](/profile/warren) [@cess](/profile/cess) Please provide any further suggestions form your side to improve upon the proposal. I have added on for providing input field for alt text in new posts (mockups are attached above) and also added accesslint implementation. Thanks!
