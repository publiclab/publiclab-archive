In industry, we commonly used draeger tubes to measure for a number of contaminants.  There are other companies that make less expensive versions of the same thing.  You would buy tubes for formaldehyde, or benzene, or whatever substance you wanted.

Flow needed to be maintained. But this could be done with a hand pump.  There are more expensive pumps, if you can pay for them.
