Hi, Chris - this is so great. I had just been talking with folks at NASA Globe and the AREN project about wanting to test a datalogger with one of these wind sensors, and you've done it!

A few notes that may help -- I believe one of the sensors is for high wind, and one for low. I also wonder if a separate "clean" power source is important or if that's accounted for in the circuit already (guess I've got to read the data sheet...)

I suspect your thought about the sensor moving around in the air locally is probably a good guess. Imagine -- any oscillation, any swinging back and forth, would cause a regular spiking of the signal, even above baseline noise. 

A couple follow-ups I'd like to try are:

1. running this alongside a [Kestrel or similar wind sensor](https://www.amazon.com/s/?tag=duc0c-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=kestral%20wind%20sensor) for comparison
2. doing it both at altitude and under a controlled situation like a fan running indoors

I think we might have a Kestrel somewhere. Do you have any interest in these tests and would you like me to send you one? You like getting mysterious gizmos in the mail, right? :-)
