Here is a page about the PMS5003 and 7003 ... 
https://aqicn.org/sensor/pms5003-7003/

The difference seems to be in their internal layout. In that link they show a 5003 opened after several months outdoor and the light sensor seems to be "dust free" which the 1003 suffered from ... don't know the internal layout of the 7003 but unless you're "size constrained" I'd go with the ones that have been shown to keep themselves clean inside.
