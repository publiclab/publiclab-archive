[@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) [@mathew](/profile/mathew) [@marlokeno](/profile/marlokeno) Hey, Kevin here from TZOA. I met Shannon Dosemagen of PublicLab at an EPA event last year. Happy to answer any questions. We currently have research units out in the wild of the custom particulate sensor we engineered. We are doing a new production run which will be available in September. Would love input from everyone here. Cheers! -K
