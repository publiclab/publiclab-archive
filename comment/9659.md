Good observations -- but why use a CFL which has poor SNR for wide-band averaging because the spikes prevent using higher light intensities for broad-band measurements? Switch to a halogen and then search for a wider bandwidth (which shows indications of sugar sensitivity) to average which should have a higher SNR.
Cheers, Dave
