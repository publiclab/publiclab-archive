I like your idea of "users can be prompted to mention the 'type' of the content before publishing it." -- and the screenshot you provided. It could offer more guidance on what each one is as well, even beyond just a dropdown menu! We have a little bit of an interface for this already here, but it's pretty primitive:

How might we present the power tag prompt without using jargon like "power tags" which may not be clear to new users?
