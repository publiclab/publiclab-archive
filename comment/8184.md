I added an additional graph to show the expected active cholinesterase concentration for safe and unsafe zones based on our measurements as well as what the kit manufacture states (we think there is an error in their documentation).  Basically, I kept diluting down the stock (control) cholinesterase until I got an unsafe result.  The new fig is fig 3, and it shows if there is <10% active cholinesterase from the stock, which would be ~44uM, then the result is a positive (unsafe).  I need to test 15% active cholinesterase to match what the manufacture specs.
