Hi [@mimiss](/profile/mimiss), we talked about this on our call this week.  I think it would make sense to send 1-2 with the kit to help people get set up but also stock them in sets of 5 for purchase (and encourage people to buy them in sets of 5).   Basically, we were told you need  to have enough on hand that you can respond to whatever situation comes up.  So if there's a fire or an explosion, you might take 4-5 samples (and want enough bags to do that).  If you're responding to a slow leak, you might only take 1-2 samples.  You want to have enough on hand so if you need to take a sample, you aren't short a bag. 

The goal is to encourage people to have a small stock on hand so they can use them.  That's going to be cost-prohibitive to send with the kit, which is why encouraging people to separately buy 5-10 to have on hand, based on their needs, is probably the way to go.
