Hi Warren, thanks! I'll definitely try to document my process well as it comes along. I have a lot of motivation to get this going because I want to start some home based horticultural research, and be set up before the end of the summer '19.

Just for clarification, what are you referring to regarding lighting control? I'm guessing you might be talking about calibration, but I the point of this spectrometer is to characterize lighting setups for plant experiments so I wasn't sure.
