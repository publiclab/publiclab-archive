Hi Warren,
I don't know what resolution I need yet, TBH. Initial data from the RGB data from cell phone cameras shows that knowing the geographic location and timing of collection lets us ID most species (the RGB data forming a cloud that occasionally partially overlaps with another species). I want to move to spectrographic data to tease that apart, since I think two species which look the same may have different peaks. I want to build my library with the best resolution possible, so I could do $100-200 and send a handful of those out to initial collaborators. Ideally it would be closer to $50 so I can increase the amount of collaborators and even let people buy the part and assist us. In the end I hope that we'd be able to use the $10 spectrometer for the end user who would be querying the library. 

Pollen identification from color was last reported on in the literature in the 1970s. Time to update it. 

I considered the RPI, but to add a touchscreen, camera module, battery pack, and GPS... I just don't want to go down that route unless I have to. I like the idea of the phone having an app that does it all and includes a GPS and time tag. We could even use the cellular connection to query the library and get results back in the field. 

What USB cameras are being used right now? Would it be better to look for a cheap black and white high resolution camera? What resolution is worth bothering with? I'm thinking black and white because it might not have bayer filters on it and that would increase sensitivity of the sensor across the whole spectrum. 

Could I write Public Lab into a grant so that you get some grant money to do software development?
