Ok, yeah, the film from a floppy disk is supposed to work well for this.  If the green light is on and there's no picture at all, it sounds like the connection to the sensor may be damaged.  Can you see anything obviously wrong when you look at the electronics inside?  Wires broken off, components damaged, foreign objects stuck in the components, or anything like that?
