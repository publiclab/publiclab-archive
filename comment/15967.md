Hi ddnoob. I have not quantified the resolution, but by my estimate, the wavelength resolution is around 1nm when everything is optimized. The intensity resolution is set by the microcontroller you are using. If your using the Texas Instrument Tiva Launch Pad, like I am, then the intensity resolution is 12 bit. 

If you want to increase the resolution there are a number of things you can do. First, use a narrower slit. This will decrease your signal intensity, but increase your resolution. Second, use a CCD with more elements. Using something like a Sony ILX511A CCD, which has 2048 pixels rather then the 768 the current CCD uses, will give you more pixels per wavelength hitting the CCD. Thirdly, you can use a grating that has more grove per inch.  This will also increase your resolution, but with the cost of decreased signal intensity. To my knowledge these are the only ways to increase the resolution without redesigning the entire spectrometer. Hope this helps.
