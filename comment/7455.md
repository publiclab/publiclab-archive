Wow, quick response! I was going to also add this to the "acceptable" category so I'm glad you already did that. I too would not recommend this to anyone doing this for the first time (though I fell into that group) or who aren't willing to risk destroying a camera. Had I known how risky it was, I might have chosen a different camera, but since it worked, I think it will be great for our use. I'll be testing the battery life on some small surveys, and if it isn't great, I'll be putting together an external power supply for dual cameras and will possibly trigger the shutter with an Arduino or RasPi (easier to sync from what I understand) instead of CHDK since we are looking into using barometric and temp sensors and will have other hardware up there anyway.
