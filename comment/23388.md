  Hi [@jywarren](/profile/jywarren)
Regarding the metadata. How about creating sidebar but it would collapse to one single icon. 
Right now we have many metadatas and if we include more, it would distracting for the user. Especially when, the first contact should be the content and Title. 

I noticed that other blog sites deal with this using collapse or drop-down feature. While reader is reading the information, we can try to keep it minimal.

We can classify the info between just reader and reader/editor/etc.

If someone is interested in editing and other features, then for that there would be an icon which provides a route to all the options available.

So How about going for something like Quora ? 

I'm unable to upload image here.


Quora follows some icons above the answer section and others are shown in drop-down. Instead we can use collapse-icon. We can leave date,author and views. Other than that data everything would be collapsed.

 eg  -- img-circle-profile || Author name    --------------------------------- Views || Collapse-icon 

2nd row-------"-----------|| Date of publishing  ------------------------------------||--------"---------

Regarding centre align of title, How about centre aligning it for wiki but not notes.
To make it more impactful.

But notes could be from left aligned.

I would like to work on this design and post a note on my thoughts soon.
The direct wireframe of my methodology and ideas would be better explanation of my thoughts :).
