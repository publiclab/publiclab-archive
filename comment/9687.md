I haven't-- the security cameras with these built in are pretty expensive new.  I was excited to find that the part itself was affordable.  [@noctividus](/profile/noctividus) has a note on a raspberry pi camera knock off (same sensor) that takes m-12 and C-mount lenses. I've been meaning to buy one and try with the filter switchers I have designed for those mounts.
