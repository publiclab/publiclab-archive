While we knew construction was happening at the site (based on aerial photos we acquired back in Feb), we were curious to see what, if any, additional work had been done. It's tough to tell exactly what's happening based on the photos we got on Saturday. But the real value is knowing that this method can be used as a successful way to peak behind the curtain and monitor what's happening with the construction. Perhaps we'll try again in the future....

Fingers crossed about the appeal that was just submitted last week. Construction of this nature really should require a special permit and be subject to a public hearing.
