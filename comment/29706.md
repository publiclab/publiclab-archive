Today, we learned that the history of microplastics is somewhat confusing. Only about 5 years ago, barely anyone knew what microplastics were, there wasn't even a unified definition of microplastics. This was  scientists such as Dr. Scott Coffin began to push law makers for more awareness of these plastics. This has resulted in a unified definition and understanding of what microplastics are, as well as a large group of people researching the causes and affects that microplastics can have on the environment, animals, and humans.
