My major concern is about water.  Yes, we have 5 gal jugs of water on hand.  But only a few of them.  We live in a rural area, and in a power outage there are very few manual pumps around for the wells. 

As for food, we preserve some of our own food ( both pressure can and cold pack).  We used to have a large garden, too.  But now it is less expensive to purchase it from Amish farmers.
