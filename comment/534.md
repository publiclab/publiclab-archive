This discovery is important nowadays with the occurrence of <em>E. coli</em> outbreaks that kill a lot of people. <em>E. coli</em> has many strains and certain characteristic that evade detection when put under stress as they go dormant and undetectable. It's good that <a href="http://www.appisaurus.com/3268-e-coli-detector-attachment">UCLA scientists create <em>E coli</em> detector attachment for cell phones</a> so before we even get to ingest these <em>E. coli</em>-infected foods, we get to check if they are clean food. Prevention is still better than cure.
