Thank you Dave. By the way, I had a look at your works and was very impressed. (Not that I would have understood most of it...) But one question came into my mind when I saw your setup: if you send the light through polymethylmethacrylate (however this molecule looks like) cuvettes - don't they also absorb light in certain (carbone/hydrogen) wavelengths? And if you use glass cuvettes - don't they absorb certain (silicate/oxygen) wavelengths? And how about the dilutant (water, alcohol, whatever...)? Do you create a "zero-spectrum" WITHOUT the actual agent you want to resaerch - i.e. only with the cuvette and dilutant in the light path - and then sustract the spectrum from the one you get WITH the agent?
