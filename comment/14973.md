Hi Rebecca,

Your NDVI values are a little low, but that is to be expected when the procedure is not calibrated. To get the NDVI values closer to the proper range, you can set a custom white balance on the camera using a bright red surface [as described here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/infrablue-white-balance). It's hit or miss finding a good red surface because you need one with the proper relationship between reflectance of red and reflectance of NIR.

The red and blue channels in your photo are not over or under exposed, so that is not the problem. The blue channel (NIR) is a little bright, but still has good information in it. Exposure is an issue to remain vigilant about, because a dark photo will produce different NDVI values than a bright photo. 

If your goal is to compare different melon plants, it doesn't really matter what the actual NDVI values are, only whether there is a difference among plants. So getting the NDVI values into the proper range might not be so important.

A bigger issue might be distinguishing subtle differences among melon plant health. If some plants are just a little stressed or nutrient deficient, their NDVI values might differ by only 0.1 (or less) from healthy plants. The color look up tables typically used for NDVI assign pretty much the same color to the values 0.4 and 0.5, so if want a good visualization of the study you might need a custom look up table with many distinct colors for NDVI values between 0.3 and 0.6.

Your NDVI images show a range of NDVI values within individual leaves because the leaves are not flat and sun incident angle modifies the reflectance. Darker areas are producing higher NDVI values. This is probably because darker areas have lower values for (NIR+VIS) but the difference between NIR and VIS is still large, so (NIR-VIS)/(NIR+VIS) gets bigger. You will have to decide how to sample to average all leaf surfaces or avoid some subset of darker or brighter surfaces.

Fiji has good tools for sampling and it computes the mean and variance for a sample ([example here](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/05-23-2016/graze-anatomy)). It will be difficult to automate this process because somebody has to draw a polygon around the leaf surfaces you want to sample. Taking the photos so they include just the area you want to sample could work if each photo has the same proportion of leaf surfaces at every angle. This could allow computing mean NDVI for the entire photo, but there also has to be the same proportion of soil, stems, fruits, flowers, etc. in each photo. And no shadows of the camera, etc.

So the variability within a leaf of a healthy plant is probably going to be much greater than the difference between that plant and a stressed plant. Your sampling protocol will have to be both rigorous and extensive to demonstrate that difference.
