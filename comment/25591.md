Things are advancing (although a bit slower than I hoped, but I guess that's to be expected). I am still designing a plan for the entire system (including community input, hardware, DIY workshop, IRB approval, metrics to measure). In the meanwhile, I'm waiting for my components to arrive so I can start prototyping, and trying to model the system using NetLogo (Agent-based-modelling). 

We have agreed on a timeline where we model and prototype until the end of this year (2019) to make sure we have a rugged, accurate system - and the DIY workshop some time in January or February 2020. Partly because obtaining IRB approval is a time-consuming process, partly because we just want to be thorough and not sink a lot of money on faulty equipment/ bad system design. The people I'm working with at the NGO assured me that it's better to spend a little bit longer on planning than spend a lot more time troubleshooting issues in the middle of the project implementation. 

I will post my models and research here in the meanwhile, as updates to this project! Thank you so much for your input and engagement. 😃
