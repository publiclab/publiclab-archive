We need a lot more stories like this of KAP sessions gone awry; there is a lot more to learn here than when everything goes well. But maybe most of these stories are never shared (or have some details left out) to protect the innocent. Now that I review my [2011 post about losing my new Fled](http://fastie.net/the-fled-flew-then-fled/) kite to a tree, I see that I neglected to mention that I pulled very hard on the line as the kite dove into the forest. I had no knowledge that the first lesson of kiting should be that pulling the line just encourages errant kites. The Fled should have had a tag which said "Let line out fast to stop a dive" (and also "Do not remove under penalty of crashing").

I am glad Rural's gear survived to provide more stories.
