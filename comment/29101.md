[@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) I think part of the answer to fertilizer might be efficient recycling of wastewater and the treatment byproducts, like biosolids.  For example, the current best practice is to convert ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite in wastewater into N2 and off-gas it back into the atmosphere so that it doesn't cause algae blooms.  Obviously capturing it and using it on crops would also keep it out of the water.  It's sort of like the inverse of food miles.  Some worry about how far the food travels, but then another concern might be where we concentrate all of nutrients that were used to grow that food.  There is the added challenge of getting them recycled and back to the places where the food is grown so that they don't create negative side effects in watersheds that people rely on.

Another issue is pollutants that there are no good processes to treat, chemicals that don't break down, like PFOAs and such.  These are an impediment to recycling wastewater to grow food crops because they are absorbed by the plants.
