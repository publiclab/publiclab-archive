I just updated https://repo.or.cz/purpleair-notify.git

It's a complete re-write adding Discord `!start` and `!stop` commands.  

Also:

* messages if PurpleAir JSON changes
* uses 3rd party source for Humidity (and Temperature)
* adds daily and weekly averages

Give it a try.

On a side note PurpleAir recognises the cumulative averages used now are very slow moving.  It is their nature.  I hope they will switch to simple moving averages soon.
