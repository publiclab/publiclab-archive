Hi, I just posted a call for session ideas here: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-27-2017/what-sessions-would-people-like-to-have-at-the-2017-barnraising

You can edit the Barnraising page with the `Edit` tab at the top, but I think this new sessions post may make that less necessary! Eager to hear your session ideas!
