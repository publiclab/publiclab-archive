Hey  Guillaume851, that's good, I like a sense of humor, so try and keep up here, number 1, I use a data program called spekwin32 to process the spectral data that I export, the program does it for me if I want, or you can do it by hand also, which ever is the most "loving" way you like. Anyway below might be a better description for you:

Deriving the Beer-Lambert Law
Assumption one relates the absorbance to concentration and can be expressed as
A∝c(1)(1)A∝c
The absorbance (AA) is defined via the incident intensity IoIo and transmitted intensity II by
A=log10(IoI)(2)(2)A=log10⁡(IoI)
Assumption two can be expressed as
A∝l(3)(3)A∝l
Combining Equations 1 and 3:
A∝cl(4)(4)A∝cl
This proportionality can be converted into an equality by including a proportionality constant.
A=ϵcl(5)(5)A=ϵcl
This formula is the common form of the Beer-Lambert Law, although it can be also written in terms of intensities:
A=log10(IoI)=ϵlc
