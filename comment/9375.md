I've been operating on the assumption that the EPA/ISO standard = PM2.5.   I guess this is an etymology question. which came first: PM2.5 or the EPA/ISO standard PM2.5?  the standard defines PM2.5 particulates by the 50% cutoff point.   If we're measuring PM2.5 I've been assuming that we're getting an equivalent to this filtration standard, not a measurement of just 2.5µ particles.
