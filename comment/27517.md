With Covid making it hard to predict whether students will be in the lab, or working from home we’ve done an incremental update to the ‘Classroom Logger’ tutorial which separates the soldering steps from the rest of the assembly. Instructors can add/remove those steps as need for whatever situation they are dealing with at their institution.
