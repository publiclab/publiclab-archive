I can't believe you're doing such serious repairs! impressed. I've never been able to get the lens assembly off safely, though i guess it's been over a year since i've tried. 

Actually I was thinking of trying to make a pinhole for an SLR or micro 4/3 camera, to do lensless spectrometry for sub-350 nanometer wavelengths...
