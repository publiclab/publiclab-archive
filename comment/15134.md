[@warren](/profile/warren) Should I write the documentation on posting a question on a wiki page and link it to the question page? Another alternative may be to add a Help button that pops up a modal on which the instructions and a Post button can be given. What do you suggest? I can add this to Pull Request [#628](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/628)
