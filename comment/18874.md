> email creating editor for the admin to send emails to the users

This is interesting -- what about something similar, where we have a way to notify groups of people, like how we do on GitHub like `@publiclab/reviewers` -- a "group" handle. On `plots2`, we could do: `@g/partsandcrafts` -- to notify people who have the profile tag `partsandcrafts`. We may also want to ensure that only moderators can do this, or it'll create a lot of email flying around!

Let's make an issue for this last idea and add it to the list of email features. It's not high-priority but could be pretty easy to implement, given profile tagging and the existing email templates.
