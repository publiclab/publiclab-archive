This is starting to come together, thanks!

I do want to suggest we use a Bootstrap UI style, like potentially vertically stacked pills, here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#nav-pills, for the sidebar. 

Just a small detail but it'd be great to see the # of contributors listed, for a sense of "how big the community around this topic is".

I also feel like the questions could be more highlighted -- what about, like in the sketch i just posted, a horizontal band of a few recent questions, and a prompt to post your own questions, above the rest of the work below? I just feel like people may miss the questions section in the menu bar but maybe you have another creative solution.

I'd also like to start distinguishing between "content that's most important/interesting" versus "what's most recent" -- perhaps the main view would be of the top overall, but there'd be an easy way to toggle to content that's "new this week" or just "recent updates". What do you and [@edie-blues](/profile/edie-blues) think about this distinction? Maybe [@joyofsoy](/profile/joyofsoy) and [@stevie](/profile/stevie) have some input on this particular balance of "new" versus "important"?
