It is possible the wikipedia article on Reynolds numbers might help-
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number

At any rate, the article does give the relation of dynamic and kinetic viscosity:
[sorry, I don't know how to code for Greek letters.]

{\mu} is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa·s = N·s/m² = kg/(m·s)).

{\nu} is the kinematic viscosity (\nu = \mu /{\rho}) (m²/s).

{\rho}\, is the density of the fluid (kg/m³).

This article is fun, albeit over my head-I started thinking of applications from it for kite design:
"Aerodynamic Performance of a Corrugated Dragonfly Airfoil
Compared with Smooth Airfoils at Low Reynolds Numbers "
