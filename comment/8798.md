Hi Mercy - we're curious about your proposal -- do you think it would not be too ambitious to add a few more tasks to your plan, such as:

* tilt/compass data embedded as EXIF tags in photos
* display of weather information and "how-to" instructions slideshow on the home page? 
* maybe a display of the highest altitude reached since the camera has been running, and the amount of time, # of photos that've been taken?
