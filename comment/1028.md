totally.  some sort of logarithmic curve makes a lot of sense-- the curve would reflect the inaccuracy of large ranges and give more accurate adjustment within the small ranges most used.

I'm going to try to mount the nomogram directly onto two slider pots and make it the adjustment interface too-- picked up a great joystick last night at dorkbot that I think I can hack quickly.
