In these experiments, the bubbler will increase the humidity in the chamber or room. That alone could reduce the dust in the air (by dampening the dust?). So it might be hard to know if the silica was being removed into the bubbler water or not. But if bubbling reduces dust, then mission accomplished. As long as the humidity does not remove your wallpaper.
