My favorite form of on-the-go documentation are the [small science zines](http://asyang.wixsite.com/small-science), which we've used to document stuff at Parts and Crafts as well as (very occasionally) Public Lab.  

Small Science Collective is great and would be an awesome venue for posting Public Lab projects. There are lots of online walk-throughs for how to make the basic 8.5x11 mini zine, [here's a good overview](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iFWeoetq-XQ/UeVHc9sbEFI/AAAAAAAAAxs/kPqVi8DlNHM/s1600/how+to.jpg).
