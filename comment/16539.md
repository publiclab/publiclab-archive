Hello, thanks so much for your thoughtful and detailed proposal. Have you had an opportunity to download and set up the `image-sequencer` codebase? We'd love to see a small pull request from you, even for a minor change -- it's helpful to see how familiar you are with our contribution workflow. Thanks!
