Chris, re the Mobius Rosco2007 image, some comments and questions.
By "meaningless" do you mean that the pine board looks so much like the living plant matter, or that the dead stuff is so positive and the living stuff much less so?
One comment, the red channel in that image is about 20% overexposed, mostly on the green growing stuff, but also on the pine board. Might that contribute to them looking the same? (wish I could put an image of the overexposed pixels here, but it can be had at [this link] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzsIfcPtBojNVlpfN0x1V1dtMFE/edit?usp=sharing)
 
Second, assuming you take NDVI=(NIR-VIS)/(NIR+VIS), which channel do you use as NIR and which as VIS?  It looks from some earlier posts that the Mobius blue band is pretty NIR sensitive.

Finally do you have raw versions of these images that I could look at?
