 Woops sorry! I didn't mean the community is good or bad. Was referring more to structural idiosyncrasies that either were + or -. 

Would you say I was unfairly critical in my anecdote? I was a little worried about that from the start. I did do my research, though, and there is one maintainer for the entire thing -- assuming he doesn't speak every language and there's a system of trust or some other review process in place we don't see. 

Also, I think you'd remember be than me but there were people working specifically on bots in PL. Have you connected with them about it?
