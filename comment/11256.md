I was thinking along the lines of a U-channel. Drilling takes a lot of setup and if we could use a Dado blade or a router it would go fast.  We get wooden blocks cut at a shop that replicates custom moulding for historic restoration, so they have a lot of gear for cutting shapes linearly. 
We'll probably stick with the Ash because it is pretty cheap in finish grades, so we don't have to do finishing work on the blocks.
