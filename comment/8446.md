Chris,
> Drag and drop is ubiquitous so probably easy to implement. The next issue is what to do with the photos after they  are uploaded. Should they be displayed on top of one another in the middle of the map? Should they be aligned in a  row off to the side? Should they be displayed as icons, any one of which can be opened and displayed as the user  needs them?

This would be a great addition to the image upload interface, my approach would be to upload multiple images and list them off-map. The user can then select photo's to display them on map.  
Again my initial proposal was to take only the auto georeferencing project and basic enhancement of upload interface. So adding more features would just be a failure to complete in the summer time. I will think over this and update proposal accordingly or maybe I can work if I complete my project early.  

> EXIF location data in the photos could be used to place them on the map, but this has shortcomings:

I understand this, but as I mentioned my project idea is to guess the image location on map as much as possible using available EXIF data, so if no data is present the user can fallback to regular approach.   

> Very few photos ever uploaded to MapKnitter have GPS data in the EXIF header.

Users who use Mapknitter frequently will find the current process painstaking. Due to this, some kind of tutorial or steps on ensuring GPS data can be advised for the users.

Most android devices support GPS(lat, long, alt). Probably an [android](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-developers/hHTnrzMT7B0) app for taking images?

I think Iphone photos has GPS in their EXIF(not sure about this, anyone using Iphone here?). [Iphone sample data](http://www.brianklug.org/2011/11/a-quick-analysis-of-exif-data-from-apples-iphone-4s-camera-samples/)  

> GPS data will come from the camera in the air and not necessarily account for tilt and subsequent displacement of the photo's location on the ground.

As mentioned earlier, the idea is to position the image approximately using the EXIF data. The position need not be final, therefore the user can correct them as required. This is better than just placing the photo at an unreasonable position on the map.

> This is one of the fun parts of MapKnitting.

Oh, I never gave thought to the fun part in knitting, maybe an option to turn off auto georeferencing?   

> it a reasonable summer project to create from scratch a system to place the photos on a map?
That would be great thing, should probably note this and give it some thought.

Thanks for the great points and suggestions, will review your tips, questions  and update the proposal accordingly.
