To set the Mobius camera to take a photo every few seconds, install msetup from here: <https://www.mobius-actioncam.com/downloads-info/>. Under Photo Mode there are options for time-lapse.  

I don't think infragram.org displays the color table and NDVI values. The NDVI image below was made with the Photo monitoring plugin for Fiji (<http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/07-22-2015/introducing-the-calibration-plugin-for-imagej-fiji>)

With the Fiji plugin you can make a floating point image that has the actual NDVI values in each pixel. Below is such an image with a graph of the NDVI values in a transect through the field (yellow marquee).  Individual rows of crops can be distinguished in the profile.
