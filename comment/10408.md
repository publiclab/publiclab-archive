I have not previously seen NDVI images quite like these, so the first thing to check is that the expression you include above:

`I've measured NDVI using only the NIR camera's picture (B1-B3/B1+B3)`

is being entered as ((B1-B3)/(B1+B3)).

The second issue is that the photos from the Wratten 25A camera will not easily produce meaningful NDVI unless a custom white balance has been done on the camera. Not all cameras allow this.

The third issue is that NDVI results will be more useful if different cameras are used to capture NIR and red. Since you are flying two cameras, results could be better, but you have to synchronize the shutters and point the cameras at the same scene.
