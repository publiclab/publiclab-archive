Thoughts on tags: some sites (Stack Exchange, ArcGis, etc.,) require a minimum number of tags, and also encourage reuse of popular tags. This ensures that the poster takes the time to think of the most relevant tags, without overwhelming the tag system with new or duplicate tags. It could help new users find things! There are other sites with good tagging features -- tumblr for instance allows users to tag batches of posts all at once - useful for changing the tags on old posts and having users keep the site organized.

From a new user perspective, it took me a while to learn how to navigate the research notes via tags. How about a streamlined landing page for new users where they can see some popular tags to browse?

"tools to encourage authors to invite others into their work" - what would this look like?

Will there be a "WYSIWYG / Code" toggle similar to wordpress, so you can fine-tune the layout, and copy the code to other places?

Definitely keeping in mind that the less features there are, the easier it is to create and maintain!
