OK, I've just updated with a change that stores the settings in the URL, so you can pass a URL to someone else with the current settings. For example, for the Mobius example above, you can use this URL:

https://jywarren.github.io/fisheyegl/example/#a=1.048&b=1.059&Fx=0.09&Fy=0.22&scale=1.087&x=1&y=1

And it'll be set up with the same settings I came up with for the Mobius (not perfect but close): `a: 1.048, b: 1.059, Fx: 0.09, Fy: 0.22, scale: 1.087, x: 1, y: 1`
