Great to see the photos -- thanks for taking them so quickly!  Quick items:

- Looks from the photo that the USB part did in fact stay within the ~ 18 mm width of the board. Did it?  Looks like we can tighten the cutout area around it significantly (though not necessary). That can be done without reworking the wiring of the board.

- The artwork can be cleaned up.  We should label the two "raw" battery pin headers as "+" and "-".  We can put labels for "LITH" and "GEN" on the top of the board for the two JST connectors, matching the switch positions.  And looks like we can fit e.g. "RIFFLE v0.1.1" in the space above the uSD card holder, and "publiclab.org/riffle" in smaller text below.

- I'm a bit worried about the metal vias near the screw holes (don't know if I should be), in that metal screws could possibly make contact -- I can try to move the vias further away.  But I wonder what other clever options there are.  Perhaps we just recommend using rubber washers with any screws.
