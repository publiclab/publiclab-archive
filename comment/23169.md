Hi,

I apologize for sending here a reply to the question proposed at:

The system stores the different reagents in syringes.

And the reagents are added in a mixing syringe containing a
magnetic stirring system and the color generated (depending the composition) 
is analyzed by a camera.

So far, as I understand it, the whole system is controlled by a
RaspberryPi.

A project to inspire other projects on the Water theme.

Best Regards,
Markos
