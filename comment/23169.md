Also Markos, from the [spectrometry mailing list](/lists), chimed in with😀

Hi,

I apologize for sending here a reply to the question proposed at:

https://publiclab.org/questions/Aleksi12358/07-07-2018/how-to-measure-nutrient-concetration-in-hydroponic-system

but I tried to login to post an answer but I forgot the password and tried to reset but I didn't receive a confirmation email.

So I am sending here the links that might be useful for the question proposed:

```
The system stores the different reagents in syringes.

And the reagents are added in a mixing syringe containing a
magnetic stirring system and the color generated (depending the composition) 
is analyzed by a camera.

So far, as I understand it, the whole system is controlled by a
RaspberryPi.

A project to inspire other projects on the Water theme.

Best Regards,
Markos
