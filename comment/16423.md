That sounds like a good next step, great! You can copy in your existing map code as closely as possible and try to "build" it using grunt and, perhaps, browserify. Take a close look at how this is done in the two examples I sent; they're each a little different but will be helpful examples. Do you see how `require()` methods work to combine multiple pieces of code?

Also, see how we might develop an abstract function instead of a use-specific one, here:

> Week 3 (6 June - 12 June): Add privacy options and option to remove location from profile.

Instead of doing this just for a profile, we could make a generic method for selecting a privacy-blurred location, as you've mostly done already. Then, this step would be integrating this into the back-end system for storing such a location. Make sense?
