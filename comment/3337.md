No I didn't make a "set" but I used
the compare button of spectralworkbench

I don't really care why the fake one is different , but I do know that
next time I buy a case of alcoholic drinks (whiskey, vodka etc) 
I will have a way to compare it with a "trusted"*bottle of the same brand.

My guess is that who ever made the fake one started with vodka 
or (40-60 v/v alcohol-water) watered it down to ~20% added some 
bitter-almond flavoring and then used colorant to get the same colour.
Pretty good job if you see the Vis spectrum...
 BUT he (or she) forgot about the Near IR !!!!

I don't know how the real amaretto is made but the procedure is 
surely a-bit more complex. (fermentation, soaking etc)

What is a double blind test?
can you please describe the procedure
I think my test was a bit "blind"  because I forgot to label 
the glass bottles I used, so I don't really know which one is which. 

Just noticed you are one of the co-founders!
Any news on UV spectrometry I am really interested in the
230-280 nm range
