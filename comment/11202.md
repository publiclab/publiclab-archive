The response from Pix4D does not seem to be well informed. With a Wratten 25A filter, NIR and little else will be captured in the blue channel and the red channel will have lots of red plus some NIR.  So NDVI would use the red channel for red and the blue channel for NIR. With a blue Rosco 2007 filter, NIR and some red are captured in the red channel and blue and some NIR are captured in the blue channel. So NDVI would use the blue channel for visible light and the red channel for NIR. Red filters  seem to work better than blue on CMOS cameras. Yellow filters would use the same channels as red filters for NDVI. The channels are less contaminated in two-camera systems, but results can be good in single-camera systems.
