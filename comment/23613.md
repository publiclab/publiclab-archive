 Just citing myself here, but to keep it all together in once place:

> Hi [@sidntrivedi012](/profile/sidntrivedi012)! One of the reasons we began developing the self-contained version SWB Capture was to make it more modular, better maintained, cleaner code, and then to re-integrate this new version back into the "parent" Rails app. Kind of like how https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js graphing features drive the core of https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench ui -- actually it used to be run from within the Rails app, and we spun it out.

> Also, similarly to how https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor is a sub-component of https://github.com/publiclab/plots2 ! But it has its own test suite and is easier to work on in isolation.

> And, by working in this way, we can make it easier to integrate the sub-project into other projects as well -- more re-usable!

> So, we'd love to review your proposal. Thank you!
