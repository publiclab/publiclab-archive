[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) I modified the leg bracket in Fusion 360 and have posted it to [thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1669968/#files).
[![Leg_Bracket.png](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/016/998/large/Leg_Bracket.png)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/016/998/original/Leg_Bracket.png)

I moved the leg brackets in more towards the center and angled them out more sharply to compensate, does that compromise the support of the legs?
