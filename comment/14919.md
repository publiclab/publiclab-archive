[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) I modified the leg bracket in Fusion 360 and have posted it to [thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1669968/#files).

I moved the leg brackets in more towards the center and angled them out more sharply to compensate, does that compromise the support of the legs?
