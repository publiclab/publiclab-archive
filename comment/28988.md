One resource I’ve found super helpful in wrapping my mind around both the many impacts associated with climate change and ways to adapt and mitigate those impacts is the book “Climate Change: What Everyone Needs to Know” by Romm (https://www.amazon.com/Climate-Change-Everyone-Needs-Know%C2%AE/dp/0190866101) I think of this book like a beginner’s guide to understanding (almost) everything climate change related---the science, the politics, the jargon, & the best ways forward! It’s also organized in a question and answer format, so it’s easy to sift through and find topics you’re interested in! The later chapters have info on renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, etc as well as sector-based solutions (transportation, agriculture, etc).
