Echoing [@cess](/profile/cess) and [@ruthnwaiganjo](/profile/ruthnwaiganjo) on the appreciation for the thoroughness of this proposal! 

> On further investigating, I observed that users who have even commented to a post tagged with balloon-mapping, were listed in the mentioned list. In my opinion, either the heading which says People who’ve posted must be changed to something - People who’ve contributed or the underlying Query should be fixed to only display people who’ve posted some note on balloon-mapping.

I really appreciate how you've worked to learn how the system works, by running through real examples and finding inconsistencies. Indeed some extra text or explanation should be added to clarify that commenting is considered a form of contribution!

This is def. true and thanks.

Regarding locked nodes - we currently use the tag `locked` to indicate locked nodes, and don't allow edits to the node body if that tag is present. So we can extend that idea to the ability to add tags!
