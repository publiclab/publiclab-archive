Chris - 
I'll email you the master list with all of the reflectance values for each target since they aren't really useful without the images. You need to make a different CSV file for each filter so reflectance and filter wavelengths are matched. These are the numbers for the 660/850 filter:  
0.7529225,0.860895  
0.753183,0.751541  
0.854773	0.900327  
0.0418333,0.0427029  
0.3103265,0.3549215  
0.04686155,0.05665055 

The order is from from top to bottom of the CSV values and in the photos from left to right:  
Red card stock  - leftmost target
White spray paint  
White printer paper  
Black spray paint  
Gray spray paint  - rightmost target
Tar paper - off on its own

The tar paper is toward the upper right corner and you need to select the sample pixels from the lower part of the paper since the upper parts has some specular reflection since it's not level with the ground. It's difficult to see the edges of the red and two white sheets.
