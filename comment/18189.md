I never really knew much about spectrometers (and still don't) but I happened on an article about green laser pointers which mentioned that a number of green laser pointers emit dangerous amounts of infrared radiation at double the frequency of the laser -- in my case, presumably at 1064 nm.  

I was curious if my laser pointer fell into that category, and am still trying to figure out a cost effective way to see if the laser is emitting in the near IR spectrum.  I have no real reason for this project, other than to satisfy my curiosity.
