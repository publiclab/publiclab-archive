Hello, this project is interesting to me.  My day job is Environmental Geologist. We use water quality meters that measure 5 or 6 parameters.  We use for groundwater sampling.  Since there are 6 analog GPIOs on a Uno, can you hook up 6 senors are get readings from them?  That would be interesting to see.
