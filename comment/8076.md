This is cool!

Quick aside: a friend in Amherst makes an open source board, "SquareWear", which is a wearable electronics device that has an RGB led (and a piezo buzzer + light sensor + ambient temp sensor): http://rayshobby.net/?page_id=2686  

It also has an on-board coin battery holder, as well as a plug for a small lipo battery -- and an onboard chip for recharging them ...

Maybe we could take his schematic and add the I2C breakout / footprint for the IR sensor?
