This ability to annotate opens up the ability to call out and note features. 

As increase our ability to readily produce NDVI imagery maps, I could see text call outs to interpret features that reveal vegetative health or the presence or absence of species, etc.

Likewise text call outs can be used to identify buildings, land use areas, changes in built environment, land clearing, etc.

Being able to annotate with image overlays, perhaps site plans and SketchUp models would enable engineering or architectural concepts to be illustrated.

These are a few of the ideas that come to mind.
