Ah, okay, issue:

I can drop the charging chip; but currently the charging chip performs a useful additional function:  it allows voltage to be coming in from both USB *and* the battery, and automatically only uses USB power to charge the board, and not to power the uC, when USB is connected.  

If we drop the charger chip, then we need to find a way to avoid having USB connect to the battery.  This is often done with diodes, as per:

[![diode_power_combine.png](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/188/medium/diode_power_combine.png)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/188/original/diode_power_combine.png)

[reference](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/401/switch-between-5v-power-supplies)

This way, you can plug in both USB and battery and neither will be affected by the other.  

The problem with this approach is that diodes have a 'voltage drop' across them -- this means that some of the voltage from the battery (typically, .5 V) will be lost before we hit the LDO -- which has its own voltage drop (about .3 for the one we're using).  So, running our board at 3.3V, that doesn't give us much headroom / reduces our battery life significantly for a lithium battery that starts at 3.7V.  

Hmm.  Is there an IC that performs the switching that this charger chip does, but doesn't try to charge the battery?
