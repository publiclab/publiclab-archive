Hi [@vikky30singh](/profile/vikky30singh) - echoing thanks on this proposal as we do love Image Sequencer as well as your contributions on it. However we will be giving precedence to the listed ideas. That said, both `Geographic features refinements` and `Spectral Workbench integration` will have very substantial JS components, with the first one being mostly JS with just a little bit of database optimization of Rails. The second does involve some Rails integration but mainly of pre-existing APIs or functions which we are just replacing the JS code with a newer version, not really changing the Rails functionality much. 

So please consider those two - but I understand if it seems too far outside your area of interest! Thanks again!
