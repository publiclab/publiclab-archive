This is great! Thought if people wanted more visuals and to learn more about wrack zones: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrack_zone#:~:text=The%20wrack%20zone%20or%20wrack,is%20deposited%20at%20high%20tide.

Makes me curious if I can find nurdles on beaches here in the Pacific Northwest | Salish Sea...
