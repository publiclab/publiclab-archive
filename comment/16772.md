It's been a while since I've flown my cameras, but my suggestion is to try you cameras and get develop your own data for what you can expect out of your cameras and batteries in the temperatures you'll be taking data in. For example in the CA Bay Area, or in Belize, my A1200s shoot for >1 hour on a pair of AAs, at 1 second intervals but I've not checked to see if get longer durations at less frequent intervals. On the other hand my SX260HS, gps enabled, gets like 20 minutes from the NB-6L batteries. [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) flies in Alaska from time to time and may have more infpo on temperature effects.
