My favorite website for future predictions is the the [hourly weather graph from NOAA.](http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=45.53320&lon=-122.683&unit=0&lg=english&FcstType=graphical)  it is very detailed and much better than the simplified predictions of most "weather services" which all pull NOAA data anyways.   If you're looking to make a weather app, [pull data straight from NOAA.](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/mdl/survey/pgb_survey/dev/rest.php)

Also, [Weather Underground's new interface replicates NOAA's graphs and makes them prettier and easier to read.](http://preview.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=45.523399,-122.676201&sp=KORPORTL125#forecast-graph).  They have an android app, but it crashes on my stock Nexus 5, so I've never seen it.
