Thanks Cfastie and warren for your comments and suggestions.
Can you suggest me some filters that might pass the NIR , Blue and Green and blocks RED. I would prefer to use the internal filter in my camera. I  used lifepixel supercolor filter and it is on the way shipping. I will receive it by next week. After i receive i will post some sample pictures as soon as possible. 
Besides that i would also like to see the results by using some other filter like Cfastie mentioned. So please can you suggest me filters that can suit best for my study???
Is there any possiblity to caliberate the camera by using Handheld spectrometers so that i can get good results with the technique that i mentioned earlier???  Thank you .
