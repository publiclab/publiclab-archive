MapKnitter apparently accepts png files.  I don't know if there is a size limit on png images, but they can have transparent backgrounds.  There is one at your wcu-fountain map.  It should be straightforward to remove the black background in photoshop and save a jpg as a png, but I'm not sure this is really a solution.
