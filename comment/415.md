Awesome, let us know how it turns out!

Awhile ago I proposed an installation where one of these hamster balls is filled with chalk dust and put into a sealed room with a roomba, making a sisyphean loop of random messmaking and cleanup...if you're ever down in NYC, bring your hamster and let's make that happen too!
