Hi Kalarav,

These links may be good resources for aligning the NIR and RGB images on your project:

Blog post: http://www.learnopencv.com/image-alignment-ecc-in-opencv-c-python/

Code:  https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/blob/master/ImageAlignment/image_alignment_simple_example.py 


A couple of thoughts:

You'll definitely need to align your images to calculate the NDVI image

If you put your lenses as close as possible, the alignment process will be easier/more precise

It looks like your cameras have different lenses (different FOVs?). I think that capturing both images using the same lenses is better.

Good luck!
