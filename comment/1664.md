these are great ideas-- video especially.  I've dreamt of creating classic analog tools (like a spring-based tension meter, etc) that could be videoed and turned into real-time sensors.  It would be a great way to visualize the math behind measurement.  Of course, video analysis is a wicked, processor-intensive problem.

[Open CV](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/) is trying to address issues like this.
