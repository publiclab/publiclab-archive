It still seems a little expensive to fly a thermal imager, but the FLIR One is US$250 and needs more or less any old smartphone. So it's not too bad considering it's weight is perfectly compatible with KAP and you get actual thermal data. This could be really useful for identifying outflows from industrial facilities which are typically warmer than the water bodies they are dumping into. There could be some very important applications of this on the horizon.  Thanks John.
