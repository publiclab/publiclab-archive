I really appreciate this thoughtful mockup!  
I like how the prompt to "add your location" is integrated into this page right where it's so relevant.  
Thinking about Events: So far, the events management we've built into the website  is minimal, and over time [@stevie](/profile/stevie) and I have migrated towards using Eventbrite when organizing events on behalf of the non-profit.  Eventbrite is not integrated with our website, but perhaps it could be?  
  
Thinking about Projects: The overall situation is that there is not much content tagged "projects" as it seems like individuals don't take the time to describe their project aims, concerns, location, methods, organizing and advocacy strategy all in one place, but rather just start posting progress updates. Having a set of "projects" clearly described is a desire across the organization from [@joyofsoy](/profile/joyofsoy) in Communications to newcomers looking to find what's going on near them. It is an incredibly large editorial burden to create this documentation if the actual researchers aren't doing it. Ideas welcome.
