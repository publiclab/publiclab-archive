Hi Gwill, there do seem to be a lot of terbium peaks. I have not yet figured out how to know which of those peaks are expected in the light from a CFL. Same with Hg peaks which are also numerous. Here is a figure which labels a terbium peak at 542 nm:

Jeff, A fluorescent bulb works because the electric current turns the gas in the bulb into a plasma which is by definition a bunch of highly ionized atoms. So I guess we should expect lots of different ions of all the components of the gas (typically argon and mercury).  So lots of Hg emission lines are possible, but only a few are prominent in CFL spectra. The fact that it is difficult for us to figure out which of those dozens of peaks to expect suggests that something sort of complex is happening. It does not help that both Hg and Tb have emission peaks at very close to 436 nm and 542 nm. In fact that is sort of unfair (but maybe the basis for a good exam question in freshman chemistry).

I don't know of a Hg spectra from Mary and John's spectrometer. I missed the whole spectro session at the last LEAFFEST. Too bad because there are lots of things it would have been good to get spectra of. You would think that good spectra of CFLs would be common.
