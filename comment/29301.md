Hey y'all!  Sorry for the late reply.  If you're able to connect to the wifi with password "publiclab" and you see the pi.local pop up, that is a good sign the software is not the issue.  Can you please confirm that you are able to get to the screen I am showing in the attached screen shot?  

If you can access this page and the image is simply blank, then there's likely a defect in the hardware.  Feel free to send an email to kits@publiclab.org if you'd like to try to replace the parts!
