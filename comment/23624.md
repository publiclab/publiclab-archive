 Writing data to eeprom will work with the limitations you outline.

Adding a microSD card module and 128 MB SD card costs less than $2.00.

Adding a RTC costs less than $1.00.

The code to save data from a Plantower sensor using this hardware is more or less already available.

To avoid the obstacle of wiring four devices together (Nano, Plantower, SD card, RTC) you can spend $3.50 for a Nano data logging shield. Assembling the final air sensor then requires plugging the shield into the Nano and connecting the Plantower with three DuPont wires. The [code already exists for operating this](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/11-28-2018/nano-particle-monitoring).

This solution will save all the measurements produced by a Plantower for a year with an accurate timestamp on each entry. People know how to retrieve the data from an SD card.

For another $2.50 you can add an LCD or OLED display for real-time display of air quality data.
