Thankyou so much for the feedback and clarification [@warren](/profile/warren). The mistake is totally on my part, I missed the link to the rest of the mockups. I'll go through all the mockups and create a new proposal. 

Update:
I've started drafting a new one in reference to an issue I've linked on the proposal and I would like to know if this is okay. Thankyou
