Added some stick legs. Inspired by a recent bike accident, I thought I'd try to make the camera roll, rather than try to actually stop itself rigidly. So the chopstick (dowel) legs roll the camera back and off to the side, away from the lens.

The rubber bands at the top give it some spring. It actually kinda hops, then rolls over.
