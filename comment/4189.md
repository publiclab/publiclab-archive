Dan's right that it's a monochromator in that it directs light of one color (a narrow band of wavelengths) through the sample and to the detector.  You then write down the intensity of light that hits the detector, and turn the dial to a different color. The dial mechanically turns a cam that rotates the grating so a different color is aimed at the exit slit.  The instructions say to use 25 nm increments, which suggests that the resolution is not much better than that.
