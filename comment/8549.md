Thanks Chris, but I'm not sure I agree that we're just seeing brightness due to infrared. I'm not saying this is NDVI -- it seems to work in the reverse, as you pointed out -- but that there is a systematic difference between the R and B channels. I'm not claiming I know the reason... we're in empirical-land here. But if it's consistent and can highlight vegetation, it could be a useful alternative to NDVI. Clearly more research is needed, and Mathew and I were thinking the same thing about using a red filter instead of a blue one. 

There are green things here in Portland!
