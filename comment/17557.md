Hi, Chris - we're (finally) hoping to address this in a few different ways, and thanks for your excellent and thoughtful suggestions. I've been breaking up the docs for some Infragram work into smaller Activities (starting with https://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram-point-shoot) and also posting new documentation including a video walkthrough. While long overdue, I think we can do a lot now (with support from NASA and Google) to put some capacity towards this. 

Another parallel track is that we're making it easier (in the back-end coding sense) to modify and improve image processing with an eye towards a better workflow for Infragram.org, using Image Sequencer, which I showed you at LEAFFEST:

https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/

The demo for doing NDVI is here, although it's just an early prototype:

https://publiclab.github.io/image-sequencer/examples/#steps=ndvi-red,segmented-colormap

But the sequencer architecture allows for new modules, and a histogram stretch could be one of them. More soon, and thanks again!
