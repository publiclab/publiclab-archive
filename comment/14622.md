hey  cristoforetti , I just wanted to give you some info on why you should be using the aluminum coated mirrors:

Aluminum is also common used in mirror coatings. It is one of the few metals that retain
its full silvery reflectance in finely powdered form, making it an important component for
mirror coatings. Aluminum mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the
200–400 nm ultraviolet and the 3000–10000 nm infrared spectral ranges. However, its
reflectance in the 400–700 nm visible range is slightly lowered compared to silver and tin
and in the 700-3000 near infrared when compared to silver, gold and copper. Regardless
of all the benefits above, the advantages are only temporary because of oxidation
tarnishing. Aluminum naturally reacts with air creating a barrier oxide layer and so
effectively reducing nominal reflectance. Therefore, to maintain optical integrity of
aluminum coatings, it must be treated with a protective coating.
