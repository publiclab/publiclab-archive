I don't think browser version is relevant here.  This is a standalone android app which no longer runs.   In fact every similar software I have found on android app store is variously dysfunctional -- looks like they are not being maintained anymore.  Spectralworkbench also doesnt' work well on mobile devices, multiple browsers.  Last I looked there was a login loop that one can't get past.
