Issue 7: Curved spectrum lines - I have observed that the coloured wavelength lines of elements show up as being slightly curved. This is produced across the length of the slit and across the height of the normally viewed spectrum. I have also noticed that the curvature is more noticeable at the infrared end of the spectrum
I am interested in this phenomenon because I want to be able to compare the spectra from two or more spectra obtained from multiple cuvettes placed along the slit length. This necessitates comparing readings from the same wavelength in two or more spectra.
I started with various suggestions as to the cause of this phenomena, but none of them seemed to hold as true. I did multiple tests and ended up deciding that the phenomenon was caused by the camera being close to the diffraction grating. I have now tested four cameras; from cheap webcams, to a sophisticated digital camera called an Olympus SP-510UZ, details of which may be found on Google. 
All the cameras showed the same curvature when the camera lens was close to the diffraction grating. However, all the cameras showed an improvement towards straight lines as the camera was moved away from the diffraction grating. But the spectrum image became smaller, as expected.
This phenomenon has no importance to Spectral Workbench users who are only interested in a single spectrum image.
I have found that the Logitech C310 camera does produce only a small amount of curvature in the spectral lines.
I have also observed that if I put my own eye close to the diffraction grating I can see the curvature; and when I move my eye away from the diffraction grating the lines become straighter.
I have tried using an F8 aperture instead of the default F3.2 aperture on the Olympus camera, and also using the Super Macro mode; but those changes do not seem to lessen the curvature.
Unfortunately I was not able to record experiments on my computer when using my mobile phone webcam.
I have images on my computer of all four tested cameras if anyone wants to see them, but I have only attached images taken with the Olympus digital camera. The spectra images are very similar for all the tested cameras when viewed close to the diffraction grating and further away from the diffraction grating.
I have yet to carry out tests with multiple cuvettes (up to 4) across a slit length.
