the pump's output seems fairly consistent without a warm-up.

I wanted to see if the setup retained its configuration from yesterday, so I ran three measurements from a cold start, and then three more at the tail end of a 40 minute warm-up run. 
the three measurements before the warm up were 40.06, 39.98, 40.13.  The three measurements after the warm-up were 40.23, 40.05, and 40.32-- which is to say any change in flow is lost in the noise of this measurement method.
