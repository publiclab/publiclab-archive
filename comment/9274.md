Wow, great work. For Grand Isle Coffee 10x (the one where the laser doesn't go all the way through), it looks like you could dilute it further. Or if you re-prepared it, you might be able to add less sample to the mineral oil. Even the olive oil looks too concentrated -- could you add just a small amount of olive oil to a mineral oil jar, until it was the same opacity roughly as the brake fluid? Was the brake fluid added to mineral oil?

This seems like a very important step -- getting the right concentration. Could we ship a color comparison strip or something to help people easily get it to a certain shade of "darkness"? 

Re: coal dust, I wonder if heat or pressure or a more aggressive solvent (like methanol) would help dissolve it. It may not be worth the extra challenge (we could focus on things like tarballs that are easier) but I'm thinking like a tiny "tar sands" double boiler or literally wrapping the coal dust in a coffee filter or tea bag and heating or frying it in a thick layer of oil. Or like a pressure cooker. Let's not get too nuts here though, i guess.
