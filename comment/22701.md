Talking with [@wmacfarl](/profile/wmacfarl), [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1), [@bmela](/profile/bmela) and [@partsandcrafts](/profile/partsandcrafts), you can get a card pre-installed with "NOOBS" -- the simplest starting operating system for the Raspberry Pi:

on Amazon (don't pay more than $10-15!!): https://www.amazon.com/s/?tag=duc0c-20&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=noobs%20sd%20card

or from Adafruit: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1583

You can also download the card image from Raspberry Pi: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/

And install using this really nice program, Etcher: https://etcher.io/
