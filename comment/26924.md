It is likely that the library that you do not want to use will provide the functionality that you are seeking.

Adding these lines (and installing the library) will probably allow your code to work.


     `#include <RTClib.h>  // https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib/   

.   
also:

      RTC_DS3231 RTC;   // RTC will be the RTC_DS3231 object  
.   
and in setup()


      RTC.begin();                  // initialize the RTC    

 .  
The compiler needs to know what hardware (DS3231) is being used, and that hardware must be initialized. I don't know how to make this work without using a library, but you can inspect the library and maybe find the answer.
