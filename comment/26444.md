The Adafruit VOC sensor module uses a CCS-811 VOC sensor. Modules with these sensors cost about half as much when purchased on eBay from sellers in Asia. 

These modules seem to produce meaningful results. My experience with them is limited (only two research notes: https://publiclab.org/tag/ccs811-gas-sensor/author/cfastie).
