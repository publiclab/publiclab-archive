I did this with a Lighter and a Public Lab card, thanks to Stevie.  Set the Public Lab card on a tiny fire, put it out, let it smoke up the sensor, and the light changes rapidly from green to red. 

you can show the air clearing in about 1-2 min, while you describe the parts.  

Stevie put two of these units in a box for me, and i got three requests for meetings in three pitches.  go stevie. two units is interesting, too, showing some variability, but overall the same pattern. Science!
