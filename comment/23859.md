 Definitely. Two things: 

1. I'm trying to find a difference between using an Arduino Mini Pro or an ATmega328, because they seem to be fairly the same (I found the same costs online for both). I made a purchase of both and will try to make tests on manufacturing takinig into account cost, easiness of making the sensor and quality. 

2. The display is definitely something that will make sense for a user. Maybe a seven-segment display is cheap and simple enough for showing the results, like old designs. I'm thinking of a very, very simple interface for people to make use of, perhaps to input their perception, and see how good they are at forecasting weather (rain, heat) in an effort to gamify it. I became inspired after this edX course: https://www.edx.org/course/backyard-meteorology-the-science-of-weather
