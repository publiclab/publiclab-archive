I like the general flow... but it seems targeted towards a general audience (people getting their first spectrometer, intro to spectrometry) I'd mention that there are other DIY spectrometers out there, that you were inspired by them, and over the past two years, you've done the hard work of calibrating this one.

it's mentioned briefly that people getting these kits will help with the tool development, but I think it's worth going deeper there-- like, "we did the hard first steps of calibration, and now we need your help to build a database of spectra.  With your help we can scale up and begin tackling tougher spectra, like the oil contamination that inspired us to start researching spectrometry." 

that kind of forward-looking call for assistance can give it a bigger context beyond just "hey this spectrometer is fun around the house" to "have fun around your house and contribute to an EJ-focused civic science initiative."
