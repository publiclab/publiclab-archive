Absorbance is a chemical definition of how well a dissolved substance attenuates light at a particular wavelength as light passes through a solution of the substance dissolved in water. 
  I assume you will plot voltage or some function of it versus wavelength and find the maximum at which your analysis will be the highest or most sensitive.  To determine absorbance you must derive a ratio of the ordinate versus wavelength for water and the substance being evaluated and then do a log function of the ratio at the maximum wavelength.  This calculated value is absorbance and the reason it is used in the lab is that it is proportional to concentration (Beerâ€™s Law !!) and a quick measurement in a spec can give concentration.
