I'm trying to figure out what this flat spot is, its just soo flat!  I associate it with a blow out.  

Digging in to the spectra themselves on your user profile, I'm not finding a blown out blue channel, its just very high.  

I think you did everything right on the collection end. I want to see if this is a camera issue-- not sure.  It could be the right shape.
