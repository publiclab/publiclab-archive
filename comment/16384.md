Hi, so on number 1, would that run in our chatroom, or where exactly? Do you have some ideas on one to run on submitted questions, for example? Maybe [@stevie](/profile/stevie) has thoughts on the kinds of helpful things a bot might ask someone for (like, if a photo is missing, or tags are missing, or something?)
