[@seankmcginnis](/profile/seankmcginnis) also shared these helpful links today - how to get the data for Purple Air. 

API for PurpleAir
https://api.purpleair.com/

Looks like the API is calling a REST end point - not collecting it from the sensor itself

This API documentation could be difficult in some geographic circumstances. He's going to look at other sensors that can connect to get the fields of information that communities would need to make it [the data] useful!
