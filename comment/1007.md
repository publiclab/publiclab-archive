I got 504 gateway errors while posting this both times.

I posted a new note <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/7-12-2012/shutter-timer-upgrade">describing the successful modification of the MK111 timer</a> following Randy's instructions. This seems to be a very good solution.

I was prompted to do the modification by <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/7-3-2012/timer-battery-disappoints">disappointing performance of the unmodified timer</a> with two 4LR44 batteries.
