Hi wmacfarl,

Just some information about 3 analytical parameters that indicate the "organic load" in water.
By "organic load" I mean the "sum" of organic compounds.

But it makes no distinction between compounds of mineral origin (eg petroleum and derivatives) or vegetable (vegetable oils and fats).

The original material is in Portuguese:
http://www.c2o.pro.br/analise_agua/ar01s09.html

but Google translation helps to understand.
