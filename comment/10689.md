That candle protector is a great way to picture how this sensor works! I think the tiny grate on top of the sensor itself does something similar.   I hadn't really thought of the little grate as being an airflow control device too. 

I'm not sure how the two-plate housing is really slowing down flow, except through laminar friction.  I'm guessing it somehow slows the particles down enough to normalize the flow through the grate on the top of the sensor.
