Some of the attendees of the Galveston Barnraising had talked about a similar project-- you might be interested in this post about [Bio Climatic Housing Monitoring](https://publiclab.org/notes/dbsnp/04-09-2019/bio-climatic-housing-monitoring) from [@dbsnp](/profile/dbsnp) and some of the comments in the thread that followed-- [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) shared examples of some sensors that could be a good fit!
