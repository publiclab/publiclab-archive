Thanks so much Cindy!  you gave me many links. It was a little idea I had since a long while ago to take picture from above...  I had read an arcticle on a magazine in the past about kap...  but last time in Perugia you showed us that's all so easy -  to make a picavet on your own and to attach it to the string of the kite...  it's extremely simple!
I have the picavet now, and I hope to have a kite next! 
About the picavet, I have made mine of plywood, too - one of poplar plywood, the other of birch plywood - the two kind of plywood more widespread in Italy. I've noticed that poplar is much lighter then birch (wich is sturdier) - you know that very well since a while...
Have a good staying in switzerland! Cheers!
