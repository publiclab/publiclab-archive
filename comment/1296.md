A photo of the optical bench or of a spectrum?

No I haven't uploaded things yet - mostly because I am working on the calibration problem and this is getting more and more difficult. (Even translating all this stuff for a non native english speaker is quite demanding.)
Maybe using a more computer based approach would be wise but I keep this as a last resort or for a desperate later.
So far the choosen angle is the current simplified variant to get a more linear spectrum to ease measurements and to calibrate the device with just 2 known points of a somehow known spectrum. (Maybe using a Sodium-vapor lamp of a crosswalk lighting as common reference or the mercury lines of a energy saving lamp)

Sorry, but I have not tried outside the visual spectrum yet - the reasons are: the sensor of the cam is not modded and the slit is build with razor blades on a thin glass plate - so transmission and sensing of longer wavelenghts could be a problem.

Maybe as diffraction grating expand (in opposite to a prism) a light beam into 2 equal but contrary refracted "spectra" and the straight residual ray, it could be possible to sense them under different angles and try to compensate with this information for higher-order maxima.
