Thanks for the response, I’ll upload tve image tomorrow. But aa far as I remember even if I leave only the camera inside the box the moment lid closed - it’s complete darkness. I saw somewhere on PublicLab that cameras were out of stock and then new ones arrived. Could it be that the model is slightly different? Could it be that the camera you use has AutoFocus off by default and the one I have AutoFocus on without an option to turn it off?
