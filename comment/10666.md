Lifting two cameras with a Public Lab balloon requires that you fill the balloon to just about its capacity. I think it should be 5.5 feet in diameter when full, so you just need to figure out some way to measure that. We had the balloon pretty full at Warner Lake last year. When it is that full, only a few to several flights are possible before it becomes likely that the balloon will pop during the next filling. So really the balloon kit should include an endless supply of new balloons! 

When flying a single camera, a much lighter rig is possible and no electronics are required. I just redesigned the Titan 2 Rig so the upper frame fits the single camera trays of the Redstone Rig, and I am going to start including a single camera tray with each Titan Rig. 

If you buy another A590, it will work with the SD card you have only if you happen to get one with the exact same firmware version (there is really no way to know in advance). But it is not that hard to start fresh and prepare an SD card for any new camera. Get the program [STICK](http://zenoshrdlu.com/stick/stick.html) and follow the instructions. However, you will then have to configure CHDK for remote synchronous operation. That is easy too, but only after you figure out how to do it. 

I have an A590 here that I can sell (I will replace it on ebay at my leisure), and I can install CHDK and configure it. I can also print a single camera tray that will fit your upper frame (no extra charge) and drill it for the A590 tripod socket. If I mail it on Thursday you should get it Friday or Saturday (or sooner if you need it).
