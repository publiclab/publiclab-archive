There are a lot of options for cameras to do this type of timelapse recording:

- Trail cams (smart battery power management, limited preprogrammed routines, weatherproof)  
- Dashcams (most need USB power, limited preprogrammed routines)  
- Mobius (a keychain/dashcam hybrid with good battery power management, limited preprogrammed routines)  
- PowerShots (short battery life, some have wall power adapters, CHDK allows custom programmed routines)  
- Microcontroller cameras (RPi or Arduino, mostly need USB power, any routine is programmable)  
- Action cameras (easy to weatherproof, power? programmability?)  

There is a creek, a stream, a pond, and a spring house at LEAFFEST HQ. It always rains at LEAFFEST, so these water bodies will change during the weekend and could provide an interesting test. I have temporary power near the stream (for another project) so that increases the options.

LEAFFEST HQ is on an unpaved road which is very dusty when it has not rained for a day or two. So air particulate monitoring is also relevant if the weather makes stream monitoring boring.

Trail cams (if no power is available) and dashcams (if power is available) vary in the preprogrammed routines. So some models will be better than others for a particular monitoring task. Some research is needed prior to purchase. Or the purchase can be considered part of the research (hooray for external funding organizations).
