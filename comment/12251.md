Oh, I think I now get the vocab. So the template merely consists of the steps, it may (then it would be the first procedure run) or may not have data associated with it. In that case, every non-cloned (or something that hasn't been run from existing template) procedure would be a template. Is that right?

I guess we can just listen to window.close() and resume the procedure? But, I was thinking of the redirection to be a good thing when browsers have the popup blocking issues.

Yes, a spectrum "belongs to" a procedure run, agreed. But having a foreign key to the spectrum would only lets me identify the procedure run. But I wanted to keep a track of all the spectrums that belong to the procedure run at various steps. Probably, the other way round is a better DB design?
