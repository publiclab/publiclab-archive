[@stoft](/profile/stoft) not to worry dave, I am experimenting with how to use the integration aspect of spekwin32, I'm trying to see if I can measure the minimum integration time that cmos supports and see how fast the detector can read out all of the pixel information.

I got the idea from another engineer on hackaday, although he built his own CCD ( you can check it out here if you want - http://hackaday.io/project/10738-ottervis-lgl-spectrophotometer/log/40940-recordings-of-laser-lines

This is just an excerpt from the help file from Spekwin32 on Integration menu:

"After calling this menu item, use the mouse to zoom into the x axis range to be integrated. Left and right border of the zoom box are the integral boundaries. For each spectrum a separate message window is shown, containing the boundaries, the integral value of the spectrum and the average value within the selected range.

Hint: The oscillatory strength will be shown additionally, if the axis types wavenumbers and absorption coefficient are selected. Of course, the value of the oscillatory strength makes sense only for selection of the first electronic transition for integration. The following formula is used to calculate the oscillatory strength:"

I'm still workin' on it!
