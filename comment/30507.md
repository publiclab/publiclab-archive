The south is like the natural habits as the native places that is why the Burmese python is population is exploding. It is a danger for the python population to explode here is because the snakes are taking over and taking over the alligator and crocodile population. The pythons have cased extinction in native species. There have been organizations that have came together to help with capturing the snakes so that they would could minimise the population. Thanks to public lab for everything I have learned form reading the other post from all over.
