That's a great question! The sensor unit (a PMS 7003) comes factory calibrated, and I'm not sure if/what recalibration happens within the unit. And with the set up I have, there's no further checking after the data comes off the sensor.  

This doesn't answer your question exactly, but this post by [@guolivar](/profile/guolivar) helped me understand some of the pros/cons with lower-cost AQ sensors: https://publiclab.org/notes/guolivar/01-08-2018/thoughts-on-low-cost-air-quality-sensors
