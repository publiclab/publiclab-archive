Hi [@ryzokuken](/profile/ryzokuken) this is fascinating! Will we need to write specific interactions, like [@jywarren](/profile/jywarren) started mocking up? I'm very interested in all the directions you laid out, and starting to answer [@stevie](/profile/stevie)'s questions. One thing i will hesitate on is the "brownie points" concept as other than signs of community appreciation (barnstars), we've been avoiding points, reputation, rank, and certification models. 

What are the next steps towards this idea? Maybe we could use this pad to write it up together? http://pad.publiclab.org/p/bot
