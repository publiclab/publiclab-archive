Sadly, the v4l2 upgrade did not fix the USB bandwidth problem for dual webcams; this issue probably isn't a bug but really a limitation of the cheap webcam hardware with the expected usage case of the drivers (full video streaming). The webcams have no on-board mjpeg encoder, which is one method of lowering the bandwidth requirements. The reason that Don's laptop works must be that his USB ports are on separate conrollers so are not fighting for the bandwidth - I don't think this is the case with the RPi's two USB ports. Short of finding (or writing!) a new driver that allows low FPS high res. capture, we are left with a semi-satisfactory work-around: force the stream data structure to unload after taking the capture, but before loading the other camera's stream; unfortunately, this introduces a ~0.5 second lag on my fast computer, which may be worse on the RPi. (Since this is one program, the timing can be done *in situ* by requesting timestamps from the OS [easier than it sounds].)  The lag would only be about 0.005 seconds or less if we didn't have to reload the stream every time.  I am going to muck around a bit more with the low-level stuff and see if we can't do better.
