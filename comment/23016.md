Very cool! i haven't but seems pretty straightforward just like the technique itself. If you have other uses for black and white rust resistant paint, or are building them in bulk buying the spray paint makes sense, but if only making one set buying secchi decals might be cheaper and have less waste ($7) https://pentairaes.com/secchi-disk-and-decals.html?gclid=CjwKCAjw4sLVBRAlEiwASblR--wjmo4Ho96FnH-z1trGBpQa-cN4gzCKNzD9RJ-e4Uxu1QZAcOtocBoCQmgQAvD_BwE
