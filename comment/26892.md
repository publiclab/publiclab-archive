Hi,
The resolution is the number that you enter when you initiate the export.

The label says: `"Choose a scale in 'centimeters per pixel' (where a smaller 50cm pixel is higher resolution - comparable to Google Maps - or a larger 200cm pixel is lower resolution)".`

By default it offers 73 for me. Try a higher number until it works. I'm sorry there's nothing you can do about those failed exports until the development community adds better error reporting to the user interface.
