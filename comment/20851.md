Hi, [@kelv](/profile/kelv) - ok i get what you're saying -- this interface -- 

[![Screenshot_2018-05-02_at_9.49.02_AM.png](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/024/809/large/Screenshot_2018-05-02_at_9.49.02_AM.png)](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/024/809/original/Screenshot_2018-05-02_at_9.49.02_AM.png)

So in this mockup, the ? is supposed to represent the number of questions, the wrench is the number of activities, and the person is the number of collaborators, kind of as it's listed at https://publiclab.org/methods. Having these listed on the page is important, but they don't have to be displayed in this way. You could come up with another design if you like. 

I'd love to see a sketch for the top of this page -- do you have anything you can share?
