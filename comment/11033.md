I'm not at all sure you can measure what you seem to be talking about, or at least not in the way you seem to be going about it. As far I know the effect of the perceived colour of an object being modified by surrounding colours in the visual field is a feature of the human visual system, including processing in the visual centres of the brain. It is a visual illusion.
