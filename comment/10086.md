[@mathew](/profile/mathew) I've had some issues fixing the map to the correct zoom level, so if you are uploading from a very high altitude your image might get lost. 

Currently you can try doing the following.

1. When creating a new map from the home page, try using the "Use Image" button so the the map is centered to the correct location using GPS data from the image.
2. At the mapknitter interface zoom in from the "centered" location to the approximate zoom level of the image so that the images might be visible.
3. Upload images and close modal when done. For some reason sometimes after uploading and closing, the images are not displayed on map, the images appears on the map when the mouse is moved.

Certain issues with the UI and others need a fix, will be looking into these later.
