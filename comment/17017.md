These two sets of equations do not do the same thing.

Set 1.
      var ndvi = 255 * (b - r) / (1.00 * b + r);

Set 2.
      var ndvi = (b - r) / (b + r);
      var x = 255 * (ndvi+1) / 2;

For example Set 1 can produce negative values.  I assume you want all values between 0 and 255 and not between -255 and +255 as Set 1 seems to do.
But the display of Set 1 seems to be correct, and the display of Set 2 seems to be wrong. I don't know anything about how these values get displayed.

However, the test photo I recommended is a weird one. It produces only positive NDVI values. They are all between 0 and 1 instead of between -1 and +1. So maybe try this photo instead:
