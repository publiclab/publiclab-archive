Hi [@samr](/profile/samr)!
So great to hear from you. Just to get everyone on the same starting point with this question,  I looked up the datasheet for the pms5003 and found it on the website of South Coast Air Quality Management District: http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/aq-spec/resources-page/plantower-pms5003-manual_v2-3.pdf. On page 13 i found the following information: 

* Data1 refers to PM1.0 concentration unit μ g/m3（CF=1，standard particle）*
* Data2 refers to PM2.5 concentration unit μ g/m3（CF=1，standard particle）
* Data3 refers to PM10 concentration unit μ g/m3（CF=1，standard particle）
* Data4 refers to PM1.0 concentration unit * μ g/m3（under atmospheric environment）
* Data 5 refers to PM2.5 concentration unit μ g/m3（under atmospheric environment）
* Data 6 refers to concentration unit (under atmospheric environment) μ g/m3
* Data7 indicates the number of particles with diameter beyond 0.3 um in 0.1 L of air. 
* Data 8 indicates the number of particles with diameter beyond 0.5 um in 0.1 L of air.
* Data 9 indicates the number of particles with diameter beyond 1.0 um in 0.1 L of air.
* Data10 indicates the number of particles with diameter beyond 2.5 um in 0.1 L of air.
* Data11 indicates the number of particles with diameter beyond 5.0 um in 0.1 L of air.
* Data12 indicates the number of particles with diameter beyond 10 um in 0.1 L of air
  
The Asterisk on Data1 and Data4 is defined on the same page as "Note: CF=1 should be used in the factory environment"  

**There are two questions in your original post that i'd like to direct more people's attention to:** 

**1. What do these measure and how do the "standard" ones differ from the "atmospheric environment" ones?**

**2. how would one take the quantitative readings from the sensor and translate them into some qualitative air quality index scale (like good aq, moderate pollution/acceptable aq, unhealthy for sensitive groups, unhealthy, very unhealthy, hazardous).**

  
The first i cannot answer, but i'm hoping someone else can. 
  
For the second, let me attempt the start of an answer. An AQI is an Air Quality Index set by a government agency, as stated on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index, "Different countries have their own air quality indices, corresponding to different national air quality standards." From the US EPA site https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi : 

>The AQI is an index for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you. The AQI focuses on health effects you may experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air. EPA calculates the AQI for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particle pollution (also known as particulate matter), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. For each of these pollutants, EPA has established national air quality standards to protect public health .Ground-level ozone and airborne particles are the two pollutants that pose the greatest threat to human health in this country.

> **How Does the AQI Work?**
>Think of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 represents good air quality with little potential to affect public health, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.

>An AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to the national air quality standard for the pollutant, which is the level EPA has set to protect public health. AQI values below 100 are generally thought of as satisfactory. When AQI values are above 100, air quality is considered to be unhealthy-at first for certain sensitive groups of people, then for everyone as AQI values get higher.

Here's a way to begin interactively exploring what generates an AQI reading under the USEPA AQI standards: if you visit this EPA page https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.calculator, and choose the second tab "concentration to AQI" you can experiment with entering your PM2.5 data averaged over 24 hours as shown in my screencapture below or, for other pollutants over other periods of time as specified in the dropdown menu:
