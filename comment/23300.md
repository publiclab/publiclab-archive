 Hi Sja- Sorry for the frustration. The instructions for all variants can be found on the [Community Microscope Wiki](https://publiclab.org/wiki/micro). If you're using the basic webcam version, you'll want to look at the [Microscope Webcam Conversion](https://publiclab.org/notes/bronwen/05-07-2018/microscope-webcam-conversion) tutorial. If you've got a kit with the coroplast (white corrugated plastic) stages, the assembly of the stages is printed on the kit itself. If you have stages made from a different material, you might also find [this image](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/027/269/large/preview.png) (also on the wiki page) helpful. Let us know if this helps!
