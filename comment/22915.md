Near the top of this page is a tag labelled "spectrometer".  Tap on that to start.

Once you are in that spectrometer info, you will see a link " the new spectrometry page", highlighted in blue. Tap on that.  It will give information more related to analysis by spectrometer ( industrially, you will sometimes hear this called uv/vis or vis).  Reading this should keep you busy for a while.  Good luck.
