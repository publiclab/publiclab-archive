For anyone wishing to know in the future this kit is not adequate for this task. I purchased the Desktop Spectrometry 3.0 Kit after not receiving a satisfactory answer from anyone. The camera's sensitivity to light is nowhere near great enough with even my most powerful UV sources. In my case it did not register fluorescent reactions of calcite from a 20W LED source right next to the specimen.
