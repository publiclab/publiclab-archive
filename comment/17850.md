It's really good to see these flight trajectories. I think it's an important way to document a flight. 

I have not been able to figure out how to make a KML file that displays each segment of a route with a color determined by a variable like temperature or humidity. It would be great to learn how to do that so Google Earth can display our flight trajectories with environmental data. I have lots of data from the SkyPod Data Logger with lat, lon, alt, temp, humidity, and pressure in a csv file with timestamps. Let me know if you figure out how to display one of those variables as colors in Google Earth.
