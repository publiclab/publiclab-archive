Hey [@wajeehamushtaq1](/profile/wajeehamushtaq1) Great proposal! Love the depth with which you have described the handling of the iOS compatibility and image resolution issue ❤️  Covers almost everything to be done!! Thank you for drafting this 🙌 

Was wondering if we can discuss points 6 & 7 in a little more detail as to how we can approach them. Also another thing that we might consider adding here is the geocoding feature that was present in the previous workbench version under adjustments (refer the image here the leftmost button in adjustments https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/issues/265). Another interesting thing in terms of testing that needs a rework is fake camera feed refer https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/issues/710 ✌️
