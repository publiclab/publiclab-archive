Related, I found [this post](http://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/03-02-2015/plab-3-spectrometer-upgrade-prototype), discussing in part the asymmetry in the current desktop spectrometer design. I'm designing a symmetrical layout similar to what is discussed in the post. From a practical point of view the symmetrical design is far easier to implement.
