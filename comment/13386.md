Update:

What I'd observed was that the previous version of the riffle -- 0.96 -- seemed to allow for USB programming even when a battery wasn't plugged in.  (There were a lot of odd parts of the self-assembly process, so I can't be sure that this was always the case ... but recently, for boards that were working, this seems to be mostly true).  

In contrast, the latest version of the riffle -- 0.1.1 (yes, the numbering scheme reset -- but nevermind that for now) didn't seem to allow for programming over USB when the battery wasn't present.

It'd be nice not to need a battery when testing / programming the boards.  

The initial response on the part of colleagues I've asked -- that this is an instability on the part of the lithium battery charger IC (which is providing all of the current to the Atmel328p) -- seems increasingly likely to be correct.

I found a discussion online -- http://www.microchip.com/forums/m/tm.aspx?m=670010 -- of precisely the same issue, with precisely the same chip.  The solution that worked for one of the posters was to place a ~ 10 uF capacitor on the power line connecting the charger chip to the LDO.  The thinking is that this capacitor smooths out any power fluctuations between the two chips.  

When I examined my schematics and board layouts, I found that on both versions, I have a 10uF capacitor (C5) that is intended to be between the charger chip and the LDO. (I'd copied a schematic from rayshobby.net -- Rui knows what he's doing, but I myself hadn't yet understood the rationale for every capacitor in his schematic:)). 

However, on version 0.96, C5 was very close to the LDO (and far away from the charger chip):

[![power_0.96_annotated_fixed.png](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/791/medium/power_0.96_annotated_fixed.png)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/791/original/power_0.96_annotated_fixed.png)

In the above picture, I've tried to annotate the relevant chips with ragged white circles.  The LDO and C5 are on the right, close together.

.... whereas on version 0.1.1, I'd moved C5 relatively far away from both the charger chip and the LDO:

[![power_0.1.1_annotated.png](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/792/medium/power_0.1.1_annotated.png)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/013/792/original/power_0.1.1_annotated.png)

You can see (if you can parse my annotation) that on 0.1.1, all three parts -- the charger chip, the LDO, and C5 -- are relatively far away from one another on the board. 

I'm going to experiment with manually placing a 10uF capacitor on the 0.1.1 version between the power and ground of the LDO, and see whether I can program the board without a battery plugged in.

-------------

Additionally, I found a [blog post](http://blog.zakkemble.co.uk/a-lithium-battery-charger-with-load-sharing/) by someone who relied on a a Microchip [application note](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/01149c.pdf) design to build a simple circuit (with the same lithium charging chip that we're using) that handles "load balancing" between USB power and the battery in a more robust way than is possible with the charging chip alone.  The design apparently improves the dynamics of battery charging while also solidly enabling programming via USB without a battery present.  It only requires two or three extra components, all of which I think I already have elsewhere in my design -- so I'm going to look into making my own version of this design.  

So, progress:  we have an explanation for the odd behavior, and perhaps we'll find that simply moving a capacitor on the board in the previous 0.1.1 design will allow for USB programming without a battery; and we also have a simple design modification that might make this feature more robust, and allow for improved battery charging.
