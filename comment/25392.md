Just a few suggestions for making the toolbox more cool:

- Change of snack bar text color to white for good visibility
- I saw that, we still have public lab and plots specific data in code. But, using config.json and JS you are trying to make project generic. But, let's try to aim at removing all the plots2/publiclab data from code, as others will be less reluctant in using this project then.
- let's show name with user pic. So, like a user card. Copy button can be still there with hover title copy user names.
