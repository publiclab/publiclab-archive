Hi [@SCG](/profile/SCG)!

I realize this post is two years old, but would you be willing to share links to hardware and software documentation?

I'm looking at a few approaches to DIY thermal imaging systems, especially those that use arduino or other microcontrollers and would love a link to project documentation if it's open source!

Thanks!
