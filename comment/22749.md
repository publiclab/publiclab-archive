For the [infrared cameras](http://www.flir.com/ogi/display/?id=55671), it looks like some of the cameras detects some of the chemicals listed below with this note: 

"Gases Detected and Minimum Detected leak rate (MDLR)
Independent laboratory (third party) testing confirms that the GasFindIR cameras can see the following gases at the minimum detected leak rate (MDLR):

1-Pentene - 5.6g/hr
Benzene - 3.5g/hr
Butane -0.4g/hr
Ethane - 0.6g/hr
Ethanol - 0.7g/hr
Ethylbenzene - 1.5g/hr
Ethylene - 4.4g/hr
Heptane - 1.8g/hr
Hexane - 1.7g/hr
Isoprene - 8.1g/hr
MEK - 3.5g/hr
Methane - 0.8g/hr
Methanol - 3.8g/hr
MIBK - 2.1g/hr
Octane - 1.2g/hr
Pentane - 3.0g/hr
Propane - 0.4g/hr
Propylene - 2.9g/hr
Toluene - 3.8g/hr
Xylene - 1.9g/hr"
