This demo is amazing! I just "test drove" it. 

The auto-updating readout of the text description of the place is amazing, at least around my neighborhood in brooklyn. I like that it prints a selection of street names with the result that it sounds general: "Williamsburg Bridge & Havemeyer St & S 5th St, Brooklyn, NY 11211, USA". I see that on most other quadrants over Brooklyn it prints out an actual street address, such as "20 Mauer Street". When we're working with the checkbox checked for "blur my location", is there a way to *not* print an exact building number?

I noticed that the map can be zoomed in quite far. This is an amazing feature that also makes me wonder if the precision of saved coordinates depends on the zoom level, and if so, will people understand that it is their choice of where the map is zoomed that will set the level of precision VS blurring?

I am really impressed with everything you have done here!!!!
Thank you so much.
