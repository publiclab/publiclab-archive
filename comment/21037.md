If you look at the Microscope page, you'll see some teardowns of the webcam - the lens is small, but not a pinhole! https://publiclab.org/micro

I think my main worry is that the IR cut filter may be somewhere in the lens cylinder, stacked between other lens bits and pieces. It's not clearly visible from either end of the lens screw. But if you're careful about disassembling it and not losing or flipping or reordering any of the parts, it might be removable! I'd love to know more if you try it out -- and we do sell just the webcams in the store if you damage yours. 

Please post pictures if you do this!
