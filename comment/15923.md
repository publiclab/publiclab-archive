Wooow [@mathew](/profile/mathew) thanks a lot! It looks great! I understand this is a crowdsourced app to collectively create a map isn't it? (I'm downloading right now ;) I refer to the GoogleEarth feature not to upload the images but to check the existing ones in "sauron's database" as they constantly update geographic-satellite images.
Download complete... ;)
