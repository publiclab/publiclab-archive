Found this via the CouchDB blog (http://blog.couchdb.org/2014/07/11/couchdb-weekly-news-july-10-2014/) rather than the homepage — this is something that I've been mulling over and trying to build apps for for many years. (I actually used to think of this idea as "CouchOS", basically a platform that took care of sync/security/scaling for apps the way it once looked like CouchDB would.)

Anyway, this is something that really interests me. Taking the *architecture* of what Tim O'Reilly calls [the internet operating system](http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/03/state-of-internet-operating-system.html) but putting it in the hands (or rather: apartments, toolsheds, backpacks, outposts…) of users.

It's an uphill battle and I've all-but given up on commercializing it. ("HEY YOU'LL LIKE THIS — it's kind of like some of the things Google/Apple already gives you for free, but doesn't come preinstalled, has to stay plugged in to the correct port on your router — yeah that important box with the blinking lights you aren't supposed to mess with. Since we skimped on the graphic and industrial design, we were able to keep the price down to a mere $350. What? No, sorry, it doesn't run Facebook but there's this federated cryptographic peer-to-peer overlay mesh topology used for messaging; Homeland Security wants to make it illegal for civilians to use but the EFF is — hey where are you going?")

I think a sandboxed approach like you're talking with VMs/LXC is reasonable, gives the most flexibility for running legacy stuff [WordPress/MediaWiki/etc.] and could help protect some core auth/storage/etc. processes from malicious apps.

I've mostly been focused on higher levels though, tinkering with some apps (e.g. [ShutterStem](https://github.com/natevw/ShutterStem), [LocLog](https://github.com/natevw/LocLog)/[Metakaolin](https://github.com/natevw/Metakaolin), and a handful of [small](https://github.com/natevw/chickening) [tools](https://github.com/natevw/twas]…) while keeping an ear to the ground for technology that could help make this usable (everything from mDNS to Telehash, Tahoe-LAFS to CRDTs, from OpenID to BrowserID to OpenID Connect…).

I'm rambling and am supposed to be catching up on "pay the bills" work, but hope to read through more of what you've already got here and start a real conversation at some point :-)
