That is some really useful/interesting stuff your revealing there!

Interestingly enough I know a fair bit about this from personal experience.

I grew up on the coast of Great Britain & where I live this kind of stuff is all really relevant to managing the ground & coastal erosion today.

(The undocumented streams are usually the spots where the cliff weakens and falls into the ocean quickest)

We used to get a lot of flooding down the bottom of one of the hills - turns out its an old stream bed.
The Victorians had buried all of the streams to turn my hometown into a seaside resort & build on top of it.
I heard that they also planted trees along streams so that the roots would soak up any excess water (might be worth considering for identifying streams).
Eventually our local water company dug up one of the local parks and stuck huge shipping container sized tanks in it.
The idea being - when it rains - to stop flooding by filling the tanks with water instead. They practically destroyed the local park though...

Would you like me to post more details about it?
