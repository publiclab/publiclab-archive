[@liz](/profile/liz) This was our fist time using the community microscope. We gifted a different microscope to our oldest child when she turned 5, but it was very difficult for her to use. In this photo we were looking at some prepared slides from the other microscope kit (apple peel, pollen, potato skin, etc.).

I am planning to write a grant for my middle school science classroom in the spring to purchase a class set of the community microscopes. Looking to do some microscopic crystallography with some polarized lenses. I'll write it up if the project is realized.
