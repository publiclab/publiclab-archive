Yes, i also don't know much about this, and if the airflow from the pump is enough to make it a concern... i guess any negative pressure is better than any positive pressure, though! I think it could be especially bad if the plant dries out. 

What about putting the growth medium and/or carbon in some kind of cloth bag? Just wondering about exploratory, outside the box (pot?) possibilities. Thanks for thinking through this with me, and great to digitally meet you too!

Yes, please do post a question about active carbon, if you could -- i'm interested as well.
