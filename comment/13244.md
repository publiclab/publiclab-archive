I am really impressed with the new tutorial. Thanks for that great effort. This definitely lowers the barrier for me to try this. I just dove into eBay for a while and have these items in a shopping cart. Does this collection look like it can be assembled into a working logger? The total cost with shipping is $20.00 (without wires or sensors).

Arduino Uno clone $3.61

Breadboard $1.50

Real time clock module $4.60

LEDs 20 for $1.67

8 GB micro SD card $2.99

Could an Arduino Nano replace the Uno for this build or are some features missing from the Nano? It might be cool to design a shield for a Nano to connect all the other components to. That could make a tidy package.

Below are some more or less random sensors. I am not sure these sensors operate at the correct voltage, so I'm not sure these will work:

AM2301 DHT21 humidity and temperature sensor $3.41
http://www.ebay.com/itm/301410138124

BMP180 Barometric pressure sensor $1.09
http://www.ebay.com/itm/371449104171

Adafruit MCP9808 temperature sensor $6.68
http://www.ebay.com/itm/161886933708

Can you estimate how long a logger like this could operate on four AA or AAA batteries?
I really like the tidy way you wired the breadboard. Do you know what gauge wire is best for breadboarding?

Thanks again for your "educational" version. I'm thinking of trying this in parallel with a Riffle to learn what the Riffle is actually doing and highlight the clever things built into a Riffle like the fancy power management.
