[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie), I have those same questions too re: many tags, one wiki; one tag, many wikis. I'm hoping we can start creating primary wikis that are topic landing pages, which then could link to other wikis about similar topics or subtopics. That might start to solve the "many wikis, one tag" question with regards to how a wiki is selected to be the lead wiki for a "tag page."
