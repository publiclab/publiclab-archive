Hm, Dave, this is interesting, but I have a couple questions:

> each sample @ 3ml was dissolved in 5ml of regent, both samples allowed to separate naturally through gravity. The top opaque layer was removed using a disposable pipette, samples then transfered to cuvettes (1.5ml capacity each.)

Can you post a photo of what this separation process looks like? Why does it separate -- due to the reagent?

What is the NaOH reagent for, and where do you obtain it? I'm sorry, your posts are just too fast, and I can't keep up, so I wonder if you could try to link to a page explaining some of this, so that people can keep up with your work.
