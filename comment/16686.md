So I was hoping of upcycling containers from home. I was thinking of an inner container holding the plant and materials, while an outside container would be any beautiful pot or basket (that would also have room to hold the pump). However, that was before seeing the above note of normal set-up with having a separate basket for the plant/material, which does make sense. So, technically my set-up would now be three containers :D. 


###Ideas for Outer Container:###

The top of a plastic bottle may be used as an inner basket if holes are added.

You would have to add holes to this:
