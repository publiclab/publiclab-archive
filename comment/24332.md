 Thanks for the feedback, and for the equation. That's super helpful. I asked the PublicLab when I ordered my kit regarding the diffraction lines/inch and they didn't have the information. But based on looking online for diffraction grating films, I haven't seen grating film commonly available other than 500 - 1000 lines/in, so it's probably safe to assume it's within that range.

I'm almost done with the slit, and then before I permanently install the diffraction grating I think I'll do a comparison between the DVD and the film, since I have both handy anyways.

I'm also trying to think if there's a better way to mount the diffraction film, because I don't like seeing the warpage and I'm thinking that scotch tape is not really a sturdy solution for long term.

I am leaning towards the holographic film because it probably has less stray light and probably absorbs less UV due to it being so thin. But still it will be great to have an actual side by side comparison.
