I don't think the arduino can interface with a webcam.  It would need to run a USB bus natively.  A few of the newer arduinos and teensy's can do this. not sure if a webcam would work.

There are some Arduino projects to get a camera onto it.  check out this [list of hackable cameras](/notes/mathew/3-12-2013/open-sourcehackable-camera-platforms)
