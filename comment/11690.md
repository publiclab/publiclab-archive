I just checked the float image I created earlier this week and it seems that all negative values are clipped on my float images as well, leaving them black (this is when outputting as a jpg). So yes, some data seems to be lost in the process if saving as a jpeg as floats are not supported.

Using the tiff format I do not have this problem as tiff images can be floats, so they are reported correctly. However, applying the LUT to this images generates bad results. All negative values are also black and it's hard to stretch the colours into the negative space. 

In short, make sure that whatever output format you use supports float values to begin with! Fiji is fickle about the LUT so loading it in something like QGIS or R will make interpretation easier.
