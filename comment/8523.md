While Gina Wirth's ArcGIS work looks excellent, that software is very expensive. A bit more in line with PublicLab's accessible and open community model might be QGIS (qgis.org), a free and open source alternative for a robust GIS suite. I use both ArcGIS and QGIS and prefer the latter for most things. While it does have pro capabilities, you can ignore a lot of the advanced analysis tools and do things like georeferencing, overlays, image manipulation, mapping with annotation, and so on to produce some great maps without too terribly steep a learning curve (some examples on Flickr here: https://www.flickr.com/groups/qgis/pool/). Historically its map composition and annotation engines have been a bit weak, but with recent releases are getting a lot better and easier to use. Some folks use Inkscape as a free alternative to Adobe tools to polish up maps. And last on the little FOSS mapping plug: QGIS also plays well with OpenStreetMap, OpenLayers, Google Maps Engine, and others.
