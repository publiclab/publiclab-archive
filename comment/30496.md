A carnivore is a meat eater.  

Atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, biosphere make up our planet earth.  

An omnivore is something that eats both meat and plants. 

Decomposers, predators, prey, and producers. 

A biome is a living space that a community of unusual species resides in. 

The Burmese python can thrive in our southern states; becoming an invasive species. 

When there is an introduction to an invasive species, native species become extinct. The alligators used to be on top of the food chain, but the Burmese Pythons changed that. They keep consuming too many resources that should be used for native species. 
There are 7,969,883,595 people in the world right now. There are 779,667,833 people without safe drinking water.
