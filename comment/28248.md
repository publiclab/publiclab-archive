Some of the early lamps for hplc detectors used mercury lamps, which could cover both visible and uv wavelengths- granted only specific ones.  But those have gone the way of the west. Agilent has an app note"phar maceutical analysis with USP<857..... "  That was a quick glance, so you may have to dig a little more. You should be able to find it on their web page.  But it probably won't help.  They talk about didymium solutions, holmium chloride solutions, holmium oxide glass, etc. Some of these can only be used in UV and from past experience, they were all expensive. 
How about using the leds that glow in 3 colors?  You need to switch voltages ( polarity and AC, if memory serves me right).  But could these be used for calibration?
