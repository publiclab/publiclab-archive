Thank you so much [@warren](/profile/warren)  for a detailed feedback! :) 

1. Yes, you’re right. Information in the footer improves a website’s overall usability, it makes navigation easy especially for a website which has a lot of content. But I totally agree that for an image analysis tool like the infragram, removing the footer will provide room for the main editing screen and toolbar which serves as the main purpose of the infragarm tool. As already the footer which exists is very minimal, we can move some of its components to the Navbar such as ‘Report bugs’ and Public Lab socials. The scrolling would be restricted and the ‘Connect to infragram camera’ button would be stuck at the bottom. 

I have added the updated mockups in the proposal but attaching it here for your convenience.

2. Regarding the mobile view, the toolbar would move to the top and a responsive hamburger menu would be used for navigation. Here’s how it would look like:
