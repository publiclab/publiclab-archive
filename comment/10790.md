Hi Mark,
Glad to hear that you think this will be helpful to you.  
The GUI was written in Processing and the microcontroller software is in Energia.  Both can be downloaded for free.  The hardware was designed using Eagle freeware.  I am not the best GitHub user but I got most of the GUI code at:  https://github.com/SmokyMountainScientific/DataLogger2_GUI
One problem is that the file extensions did not show up on the file names.  They are all supposed to be .pde.  Second problem; there is supposed to be a data file that contains little graphics like a logo, the run button, and the checkbox images.  I will see if I can get to some of this tomorrow, but it might be next week.  right now we are getting toward the end of the semester and I have a whole lot of stuff going on.
Jack
