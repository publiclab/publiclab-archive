 Yes you can...but only if your working in Civil 3d or Autocad. You need to download the lisp from autodesk first.
Import image to 0,0 then type the command "GEOREF" click on the border of image then wait for the image to be sent to its proper coordinates...now you can label the corners or item in image to verify coordinates.
