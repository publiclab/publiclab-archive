[@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) true, calibrating before a measurement (or series of) helps assure the measurement data is referenced.  As per wavelength references, while there are better standards, the bandwidth of web-cam / DVD spectrometers is, at best, about 1nm (while the 'typical' paper/velcro build might be no better than 5nm repeatability) so using 3 spectral lines from the simple CFL is generally sufficient.
