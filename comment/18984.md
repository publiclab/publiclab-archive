<blockquote>Instead of email_reply let's add a source to the comment model. Then we can in the future think about other sources too -- maybe Twitter!</blockquote>
Great idea! 

<blockquote>What if the user sends from the wrong email?</blockquote>
This might be the case when user exactly knows the node_id to which it is replying. In our case, user will reply (on an email thread) with a pre-filled subject. We need to find out a way with which the subject of the reply mail would be auto-filled with node_id (like [#23](/n/23)).
However, for safety sake we could implement the solution you gave (storing email as a hidden user tag). Your thoughts??

<blockquote>
receive_mail might be named Comment.from_email maybe? I like your idea there!
</blockquote>
That's great. Or something like `Comment.generate_from(email)` ?

<blockquote>One more -- send_digest -- could that just be a method of User? So, user.send_digest(nodes) maybe?
</blockquote>
How about having a `user.send_digest(nodes)` method which would internally call a method (of subscription mailer) to deliver the mails ?
