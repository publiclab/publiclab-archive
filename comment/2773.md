Hi Babu,

My limited experience with these techniques leads me to suggest that it will be quite difficult to separate the red and near infrared bands if your new filter passes all wavelengths greater than 600 nm. This is because the red channel in the camera is now sensitive to NIR and will generally record a lot of NIR in addition to the red. The blue channel will probably include no blue, very little red, and some NIR, so it might be suitable for a source of NIR data but it will be a weak signal (the blue Bayer filter is often somewhat opaque to NIR). The green channel will record some NIR and a little red, so is probably not helpful.

It is more common to replace the cameraâ€™s IR block filter with a filter that BLOCKS all red light and passes NIR and also blue and green.  Then the red channel is used as a source of NIR data and the blue channel is used as a source of blue data, assuming that there is not very much NIR included. The blue data is appropriate as a substitute for red in the calculation of NDVI because healthy foliage absorbs it for photosynthesis just as it absorbs red.
