A biome is a habitat within a habitat. Ecosystem is where all organisms interact. 7,969,431,664 is the current world population. 779,719,474 is the current number of people who does not have access to a safe drinking water source. The four sphere includes the stratosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, and the biosphere. Earth’s surface is covered with 71% water.  Only 3 percent of the earth’s water is fresh water while 69% of it is salt water. The present death of the world that resulted from diseases that came from contaminated water is 540,445. Two things that were abiotic that I observed from the video was the sun and the water. Two things that were biotic that I observed from the video was the lion and the horses. Biosphere is when I saw the thick rainforest. Hydrosphere is when I saw huge oceans, rivers, lakes and ponds. Geosphere is when I saw huge mountains and different land formations. Stratosphere is when I saw the sky.
