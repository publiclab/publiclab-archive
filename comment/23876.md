 Wow, great work Peter! Have you not included the non-filtered image used to generate the single channel NDVI? or are you doing 'single image' NDVI using a special blue filter?

I'm working on a similar project, using python, rPi, a NoIR cam and I'm even targeting the propagation stage as my primary use case!

Thanks for uploading the single channel image! Now I can do some simple tests while I wait for my camera equipment to arrive (without having to reverse engineer the colormap lol)

I'd love to talk about implementation, possible improvements, and more.
