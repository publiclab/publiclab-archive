Jeff - It's *awesome* that you ported MapKnitter to Rails 3!  Like, *so* awesome.

FYI the annotation branch isn't ready for production or even beta use yet.  Right now, it only allows map annotation - it doesn't allow for images to be warped.  I substantially (say, 80%) integrated Vidun's work on file uploads, but I didn't have time to integrate Anish's image distortion project.  That integration is key before my annotation branch is ready for the merge.  Unfortunately, the old image distortion code can't be used because it was designed for OpenLayers, which has a completely different API.  (As a side note, check out this recent Leaflet plugin: [ScanEx/Leaflet.imageTransform](https://github.com/ScanEx/Leaflet.imageTransform) - it may provide something close to what we're looking for.  I haven't looked through the code, so I don't know what the quality is, but it may be worth looking in to).

I am still actively working on MapKnitter.  Haven't done any work directly on the mapknitter codebase in a while, but I am actively working on a toolbar extension to enable the kind of map annotation editing (i.e. editing polylines by clicking on them and having the ability to modify annotation colors and styles on the fly) that we spoke about the last time I talked with you and [@mathew](/profile/mathew).  See: [manleyjster/Leaflet.Toolbar](https://github.com/manleyjster/Leaflet.Toolbar/tree/actions-as-handlers).

The only modifications that I made to the database were to add a few fields to the schema - I didn't remove or rename any tables or fields, so I expect that, once the desired features are added in to the codebase, the new version should play nicely with existing data.
