Haha, lots of fun stuff is possible. Try JavaScript math functions: `R:Math.pow(R,2) G:Math.pow(G,2) B:Math.pow(B,2)`

I'm making a docs page here: http://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram-sandbox

Note: For now we are using the letter "S" to represent this value, but in the future, any string represented as {mystring} could generate a slider called "mystring". We could have other interfaces as well.
