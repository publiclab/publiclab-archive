[@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) Hi Nick! Four different balloons. Note of interest, the highest flying balloon cord length was  double the other ones. In the future we could tie trajectory color variation to a magnitude like temperature or air quality like [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) has done here: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/06-02-2016/soaring-riffle
