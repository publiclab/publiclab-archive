We've been doing everything right in my opinion, and that's perhaps exactly why we're having sp many new contributors already (I'm one of them :P). Anyway, a few more things we could learn from hoodie are:

1) Include a motivation section -- Why does this bug need to be fixed? How does it fit into the bigger picture? What must've caused this to happen in the first place? This could then be followed by the actual solution and then a list of specific list of steps to be followed. 

2) Prerequisites -- Most of the time, there will be none, but this might help reinforce the fact that the issue is super-easy to solve and anyone can give it a try.

3) We need a contact/help section. Again, I don't know how to emphasise more on a better chat solution. Although one tends to incline towards Gitter for software-related chats, we could very well work on an alternate platform. Slack, for instance, is what Hoodie uses as well, and it could be used as a complete solution compared to just developer's chat. Looking forward to discussing this in this OpenHour, I suppose?

For now, we could ask the newcomer to ask on the issue discussion itself.

4) Emojis? I really don't know if they're really required, but Hoodie uses a lot of them, and they do help make the issue look a little more friendly. Need input regarding this one.
