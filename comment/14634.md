Hi ggallant. I'm definitely interested in what you have put together. I'll check out openscad to see what you have. 

As for the pipe and air bubble vent, I'll try and take some more pictures so its clearer whats going on. The chamber with the LED and phototransistor is supposed to stay dry. The initial idea was to put the amplifier board inside the chamber, but right now I have my amplifying circuit external to everything. Not sure which is better...

The 45 degree angle for the LED and phototransistor makes them 90 degrees from each other. I don't think having them exactly 90 degrees is essential, but you want to prevent the phototransistor from "seeing" the LED when there is nothing to reflect the light.
