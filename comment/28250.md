Amazon has tricolor, four lead, LEDs.  So all of the different color LEDs are in the same package. I'm this case, they give off red, green and blue light. 

 I'm not sure the Amazon LEDs are the ones to use. Some of the remarks make you wonder.  But at least it proves that multicolor LEDs still exist.
