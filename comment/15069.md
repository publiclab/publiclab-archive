This is a really helpful report. You broke some new ground (but no cameras) and added lots of good information.

You might be right that the line jerking flipped the line windings off the wire. I don't think that would happen with a typical 150 gram camera, but the little Mobius does not add much mass to keep the windings taught. I should do some experiments. Even though you had the line correctly wrapped in a continuous spiral, this is a good opportunity to remind everyone how important that is. The kite has to be pulling very hard, but if the line is wrapped wrong the entire rig can fall off the line.

It looks like your carabiner fix uses a full coil of the stiff wire. That coil itself might be all that is needed to secure the line. Maybe a coil at each end of the wire, and the line can be tucked into the coils. It might be that if the ends of the stiff wire are bent more so that they almost close instead of forming a "J," that could prevent the line windings from getting flipped off one by one. Even a rubber band would probably have kept the line wrapped on during your flight. I guess one lesson is that more wrappings are better than fewer. More observations are needed.

It's good to see that you found the 1/4" holes in the Aerobee frame and used them for the tripod screw in lieu of the articulated camera tray. Those three 1/4" holes are a remnant of an earlier design which did not include the camera tray, but I retained them just for you. Removing the camera tray saves some weight, but I decided that the 25 grams was worth it for the convenience and flexibility. 

I experimented with a separate plate to do the job of your washers and also snug up against the camera back to prevent rotation around the tripod screw and possible screw loosening. A piece of bicycle inner tube is glued to one side of the plate to allow a secure mount.

.  
Of course you need one of these plates with a hole for the tripod screw in exactly the right place for each different camera, so it doesn't scale well.

Your panoramas look very cool. With different projections you should be able to get some nice tidy panoramas out of those wrap-around versions. Sometimes if you remove a few of the photos ICE produces fewer stitching artifacts, but it takes lots of trial and error to find the best combination. 

Your results suggest that with a camera as lightweight as the Mobius, you could fly two of them with one pointed straight down. That one would capture enough nadir photos to fill in the center of the panoramas. Or when you fly a PowerShot in oblique portrait mode for JerkPan panoramas, you could also attach a Mobius in nadir position. Maybe the Aerobee should have a special mounting arrangement for that.

Thanks for this report,
