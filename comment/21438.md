 Hi, Darren - thanks, great questions!

1 & 2. any tape should do - it is to avoid any possibility of electrical contact, yes. Sorry, should have mentioned it! But given the option, some kind of plastic (insulating) tape would be appropriate. This was just some red masking tape.

2) The dust protecting tape can be removed as the last step before snapping it into the case cover and closing the Pi case. I just hate the idea of dust getting in there, as I can't think of a good way to clean it off -- compressed air? So I left it on until the last possible moment. Think of the first Mars probe photo 😃 🤖 📸 

Thank you too, and we'd love to see pics of your build! 🎉 🛠
