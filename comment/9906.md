Hey guys i have been offline for a while, with a lot of work and other projects, but now I want to continue with this!

Im having a lot of issues with the focus of the cameras, on the ground seems to works just fine,,, but on the copter the focus is still a big issue. The manual focus option of the CHDK dont seems to work at all... I have a friend who is selling a Sony Nex 3 with a broken LCD...  good news is that using the HDMI cable I can access to the menu to set the camera,,, and he is giving me a verrry good price!... Acording to what i read, it seems to have the same sensor as the Sony Nex 5,,, and this camera is the one used on the GateWingx100... 

My question is,,, do I need to get a new rosco filter to try ndvi with 1 camera only? I followed this tutorial http://event38.wikispaces.com/NDVI+Processing+in+Fiji using one of the Ir pictures that I took on the previews examples  and I did't get anything similar . I would like to be sure to have the right filters and workflow and then i will see if I can afford that camera.

On the other hand, still with a very bad focus I was able to achieve nice 3d model of a field, here is the results
