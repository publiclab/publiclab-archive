Hmm, interesting. Do you feel that's much easier than using [the smartphone-friendly posting form](/post)? 

Did you know you can use "Add to home screen" on most phones to make [the posting form](/post) into an app-like icon? I understand that it's not "the same" as just emailing in. But do you think it's more of an issue of people not knowing they can do this, or that it's really a fundamentally different interaction, or is this more about your specific smartphone interaction preferences? 

If we wrapped just the post function up into an app, we could probably make it an Intent, so that people could "Share to Public Lab.org" from the photos app, for example. But this would only work on Android - Apple doesn't allow it.
