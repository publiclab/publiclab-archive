It's a common artifact to get higher NDVI values from the darker areas of foliage in DIY infrared photos. The computation of NDVI depends not only on the difference between the NIR and red light reflected from foliage (the NIR-red part), but on the absolute value of the NIR and red values (the divide by NIR+red part). Darker areas of foliage (e.g., shaded) could have the same difference between NIR and red, but a much lower sum of NIR and red. That would result in higher NDVI values. For example, (200-100)/(200+100) computes to NDVI=0.33, but (150-50)/(150+50) computes to NDVI=0.50. There are probably some other similarly devious artifacts that cause unrealistic results when deriving NDVI from DIY infrared photos.

So sometimes the results can be better on cloudy bright days when there are no distinct shadows. It's also important to capture photos that are well exposed. Overexposure shifts the histograms to the right, and underexposure shifts them to the left. Either shift will probably result in different NDVI values. This is one reason that it is difficult to compare the NDVI results from two different photos -- they must be exposed exactly the same (light quality and angle must also be the same).

Above is an NDVI image made in Fiji. No adjustments were made. The NDVI values for foliage are around 1.5 to 2.5, and more typical values might be 4 to 6. A custom white balance which uses a color that floods the sensor with more reddish/purplish light could produce higher NDVI values. 

Cameras might differ a lot in their relative sensitivity to red and NIR. So that critical relationship between the brightness of the red and NIR will vary depending on the camera used.
