This is so encouraging. I wonder if the cameras are moving rather quickly, how much displacement (at ground level) could even occur in 1/100 of a second. A few inches? A meter? Probably not much. This will be fun to test. 

I'm planning to put together some wiki pages documenting the steps to build, install, and set up the dual camera rigs (on my way home to Boston tonight). I'm sure I'll rely heavily on this research note, but if you're interested in coordinating/collaborating just say the word!
