NOAA and Coast Guard made this guide "[Job Aid](http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/OWJA_2012.pdf)" to observing oil slicks from the air. It's state of the art for government. 

[OWJA 2012](http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/OWJA_2012.pdf)

Here's some write up of the method with a [helpful form](http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/aerial-observations-oil-at-sea.pdf)!

This would be useful for oil slicks from the ground, just for the terminology.  often it's difficult to see the extent of spills from up close, though, which is why govt usually will send up a heli during oil response for larger spills.
