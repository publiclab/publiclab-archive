Hi [@jjcreedon](/profile/jjcreedon) I personally think this will be a very important contribution for affected communities. At [@Imvec](/profile/Imvec) we're working on a slime and sludge sampling toolkit, toghether with the Hirikilabs project in Donosti. Working also with some experts from the Vasque Country University. As soon as we have a draft of the documentation we'll post it here. Thanks a lot! Both toolkits will combine like a charm ;D
