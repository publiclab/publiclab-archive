The thermal power plants at the proximity of 2km that produces more gases and mixes in the air we breathe. BC, BrC, CO emissions are also slightly higher at times based on weather.
**Velachery Res. Area & Alandur bus depot:**
 Comparatively, it has a lower spike of PM2.5 post lockdown, but vehicle movement still happens that slightly increases in the particulates.
