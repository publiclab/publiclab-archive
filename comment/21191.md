ah, good point. I guess both are relevant. We could distribute them in a dark envelope or folder, perhaps.&nbsp;
  

Yes, i also wondered about this -- both very white and very dark surfaces may be using sensors at levels where there is a fall-off of dynamic range resolution... i'm probably using the wrong words, but like low-light sensitivity or blowout/clipping might affect the use of only a white/black surface as a reference. Have you found this to be a problem, like in the linear regression are the very highest and lowest points further from the norm?&nbsp;

  

Perhaps 25% and 75% grey values or something like that might be a better choice... any insight on this, anyone? Of course, finding some consistent source of 25/75 grey material might be much harder, even if we do get it scanned with a spectrometer.&nbsp;

  

Here's 18% grey and 90% white, for $11:&nbsp;[https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Balance-Exposure-Digital-Photography/dp/B00CJ59AKK/](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Balance-Exposure-Digital-Photography/dp/B00CJ59AKK/)

  

Maybe we could cut that up into smaller squares to make a kit.&nbsp;

  

Thanks for thinking through this with me!

> Hi Jeff - I wasn't sure if you mean varying over time or over the surface. Over time both will vary but from my experience they seem fairly stable over time if protected from light. Archive (low acid?) paper might be more stable. As far as being consistent over the surface I think both are reasonably consistent. Lens distortions or uneven illumination will likely be the biggest causes of varying pixel values over the surface. Keep in mind I haven't tested these claims. One issue you will need to deal with if you are calibrating with a black and white target is to make sure the bright pixels are not saturating (e.g., pixel value of 255).
