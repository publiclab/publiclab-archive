Thanks that is exactly what I wanted to know.

I am going to modify one camera, and wanted to test different filters, but was unsure if I could do it in front of the lens or only on the inside.

You are using them outside which is great (although I just bought a wratten 25A today) and the 720nm I already have...

Anyway thanks, that was just what I needed to know.

Best regards,
Rita
