After 3D printing the battery clip, you may need to press the battery arms together while snapping it onto the Riffle board. I uploaded the [battery clip source file](https://github.com/BobStevens/riffle/blob/master/RiffleBattery.123dx), so you can modify it using 123D Design.
I flipped the 2x7 header on the protoboard using a hot-air rework tool. I also replaced the ATmega328P because the original chip stopped responding - I suspect accidental overvoltage destroyed it.
