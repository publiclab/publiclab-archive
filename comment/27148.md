Great post! TRI has gotten so much better in the past 10 years. There are a lot more helpful ways to explore the data now, and new ways to overlay it with other important information. But it's still has Many gaps! To me, it  feels more like a historic, self reporting record than a modern account of releases. The most recent data is always at least 2 years old (it used to be 3, so we're slowly improving there). Even the industries that are required to report to it, self report this material. So I always take it with a grain of salt.  Also, not everyone is subject to report, even if they release harmful chemicals and pollutants that the TRI tracks:

Anyway, not to say it's not a good and useful data source, it is! It's helpful for tracking bad actors, to find geographic pollution hot spots,  and for relating human environmental health, but it's limited.    For more recent release tracking the National Response Center (NRC) reports are useful because rather than collecting and publishing releases on a preset schedule, polluters are required to file a report "when the amount reaches a federally-determined limit."   It is the designated federal point of contact for reporting all oil, chemical, radiological, biological and etiological discharges into the environment, anywhere in the United States and its territories. 

SkyTruth Alerts is a helpful way to get updates on NRC reports within a geographic area. They're also great about adding other known reporting data sets to their maps - for example, if your state publishes spill data somewhere.
