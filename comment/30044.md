Thank you for your proposal [@abhishekchauhan1509](/profile/abhishekchauhan1509)! I'll add some feedback here:

First, thanks for the detailed mockups, they look great! I'm curious, i see some blue area around the main image work area in one, and i wasn't sure exactly how wide the image will extend. Would it be like this:


[![Screen_Shot_2022-04-18_at_8.20.59_PM_copy.png](/i/46091)](/i/46091?s=o)

Or truly edge-to-edge like this:


[![Screen_Shot_2022-04-18_at_8.20.59_PM.png](/i/46092)](/i/46092?s=o)


(forgive the rough images)

We want to use all the pixels we can on the screen, so i feel like it should be the second one, but does that affect your design?

Also, I see that on the page with the editor, you also included a footer. The current design does have this, but I was hoping a redesign would also have a fixed height, and not scroll vertically. It would be a little bit more like this interface: https://photopea.com/ -- really like a full screen edge-to-edge app, vertically and horizontally. Does that make sense? Would you like to adjust your designs to accommodate that? 

That said, I do really like how you've reorganized information on the page - with save buttons below, and the drag or select in the middle. That makes a lot of sense and when you've selected an image, you don't need to see that prompt anymore! That'll save space and keep the remaining tools simpler as well, kind of like this page: https://jywarren.github.io/bookletize.js/

As to the code, thanks for the snippets you've shared. Do you have thoughts or anticipate challenges with some of the coding tasks, like refactoring the WebRTC library, or have you thought about exactly where (in what file) the changes for resolution will need to be made in the current codebase? I like the way you've used the existing model for creating functions... one last question is, how do you think we should determine what the available resolutions are from an incoming video feed?

Thank you so much!
