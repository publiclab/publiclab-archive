[@Thorsten](/profile/Thorsten) I have not tried using a chart like the color checker though I have used materials(plastic, felt, paper) in the shade of red on the chart and they didn't produce high enough values. The darker red seemed to work better. I have a suspicion the type of material made a difference as well. It would be interesting to see what the actual reflectance values are from this material from visible thru NIR.
The above method did not account for IR leakage, it just forced the jpeg values close to the correct range with the current camera settings. I used the usual NDVI formula (NIR-Red/NIR+Red) I wanted to see if I could get the jpegs to show NDVI values closer to the correct range without actually calibrating with known reflectance values.
