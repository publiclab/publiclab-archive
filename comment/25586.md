Hi [@vnourrit](/profile/vnourrit), when you write "tricky splitting process" are you referring to having to manually peel apart the flat layers of the DVD?   

If so, the answer if one is using a DVD as a diffraction grating, unfortunately, is no -- we need the light to pass through the finely ridged layer and be separated into wavelengths that can be analyzed. However, you can purchase a diffraction grating online for slightly more money that would be ready to use -- no splitting or peeling needed!
