Thinking about the newsletter comment above from [@MDizzia](/profile/MDizzia) and the in-progress longterm segue off of GoogleGroups, perhaps upon signup to the website we could:

* subscribe people to the newsletter (which is currently delivered through Campaign Monitor)
* subscribe people to the blog (a tag on the website, which could have supporting text on the email about subscribing to other topics of interest and managing current subscriptions)
* enroll people in a custom onboarding email series weekly-for-six-weeks (like The Engine Room offers: http://www.theengineroom.org/civil-society-digital-security-new-research/ _"You are receiving this email because you opted in to receive The Engine Room's research digest series on our report "The Ties that Bind" on digital security. You will receive only seven emails from us and we will only use your email address for this series (unless you sign up for our general mailing list)._"
* something about our consistent event schedule of open calls, open hours, and barnraisings.
