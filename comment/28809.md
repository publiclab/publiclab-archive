Hi [@gauravsingh2699](/profile/gauravsingh2699), I wanted to thank you again for your excellent proposal. It goes in-depth on the complex set of tasks needed for one of our key proposed ideas, and you worked to integrate our feedback as well. I really don't have very much to suggest and want to reiterate that we simply aren't able to select all the strong proposals we receive each year. 

If I had to mention something, it might be that we place a very high value on cooperative skills and teamwork, and that we always love to see applicants thinking about how to post issues which welcome others into the work, specifically the "first-timers-only" issues you can read more about at https://code.publiclab.org. Seeing applicants who apply this set of skills to support others and help build a team is a very positive sign for us. 

In any case we hope you'll apply with us again and once again thank you for your time and efforts, for which we're very grateful!
