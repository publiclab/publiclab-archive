I did indeed remove the IR lens from this! Thats why I bought the GoPro 3+ Silver because that's the only GoPro 3 that has an easily removable lens with do deconstruction needed. Originally I just broke the filter out of the back of the replacement lenses; later I found some replacement lenses for FOXEER FPV camera lenses that came without an IR filter and were much cheaper, although the FOV is much higher at 170 degrees, so you can see the lens housing around the edge of the screen.

As far as the White Balance issue goes, you cannot adjust the white balance on the GoPro 3+ Silver at all from what I've seen, so I think this may be the end of the road for these cameras. I'm gonna see about doing some post processing magic to get workable results because in the blue-tinted image you can clearly see that the trees and organic material are correctly reflecting IR light and appear beige-red, it's just a matter of processing and colorizing that data.
