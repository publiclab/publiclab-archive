Hello! By instinct, I was doing what was recommended already.  I think it has worked.

We've had experiences where companies will send people to mess up / unplug the sensors, so people are justifiably concerned about achieving as much privacy as possible.  

If you saw where people are living, it would make a lot of sense.  There are no fences, and the plant workers up on a tower could probably see over a privacy fence and into your front window with a good set of scopes.

There's also the racism factor, people have very different access to and experience with lawyers, and so lack suit as recourse, and feel differently in their ability to call on the police if the company trespasses.
