Hi Jeff ([@Warren](/profile/Warren)), I think these transitions are governed by cost, convenience and accuracy. As you know, we're moving in the opposite direction, having used expensive and time-consuming federal reference method (FRM) instruments and now moving towards inexpensive consumer monitors. Although the Wisconsin DNR is beginning testing with Purple Air monitors, they are wary of such instruments that are not EPA approved, tested and calibrated. As such, I believe every new instrument consideration should be questioned: 1)Are the data produced reasonable? 2)Does the instrument respond to positive (i.e. high particulate) and negative (low particulate) testing? and 3)How close are the data from this new instrument and a known instrument (e.g., FRM) when co-located?
