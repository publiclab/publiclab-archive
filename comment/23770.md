  [@jywarren](/profile/jywarren) I have added calorimetric demonstration use-case to my proposal.

  [This](https://publiclab.org/notes/lit2017001/04-01-2019/soc-proposal-image-sequencer-v3-boosting-the-performance#Colorimetry:+Detection+of+indoor+formaldehyde+levels) is the implementation.

[This](https://publiclab.org/notes/lit2017001/04-01-2019/soc-proposal-image-sequencer-v3-boosting-the-performance#Week+11+(Aug+5+-+Aug+12)) is the part added to the timeline.

I have also added the [test-coverage part](https://publiclab.org/notes/lit2017001/04-01-2019/soc-proposal-image-sequencer-v3-boosting-the-performance#Adding+tests,+code-coverage+and+documentation) which is added in the timeline to the community bonding time [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/lit2017001/04-01-2019/soc-proposal-image-sequencer-v3-boosting-the-performance#Timeline/milestones+(May+6+-+Aug+26)).

Please provide your valuable feedback.
