Hello [@stefq1111](/profile/stefq1111) thank you for your proposal! It's looking great. I like the detailed thought you've put into things like where "help" links go, and the layout and sequencing of the page, and use of icons in limited space. A small note is that it looks like your page layout has vertical scrolling and I wonder if there's a benefit to having vertical full-screen as well, so an edge-to-edge vertical interface which is always 100% height? I know the current design doesn't have this but consider a page like https://photopea.com/ where it's more like using a desktop app.

It'll be interesting to see if you can get the horizontal toolbar to reflow vertically, or if you'll have to have 2 different toolbars, with CSS or JS causing only one to be shown. Do you think there could be a steeper learning curve to have 2 different layouts depending on screen size, or do you think the benefits of the vertical layout (which i agree make more sense for step-by-step layout of tools) outweigh the risks?

Ah, i see you get into some of these questions and issues in https://github.com/stephaniequintana/Infragram-Bootstrap-Mockup -- excellent. In that mockup, i'm also wondering if the horizontally centered buttons on the left sidebar should be full-width, rather than varying in widths. It could make it a little easier to visually scan, or maybe it's just a sign of my design obsessiveness we can ignore ðŸ˜… 

I also really like your emphasis on "more inviting, less technical, language throughout" and agree completely. 

Finally i like how you've labeled optional steps. I do think of Colorize as coming after Analyze, though, so i wonder if those should be swapped?

Thanks for a great proposal!
