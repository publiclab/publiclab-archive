Hi Warren, I will send you the two samples asap.
The blurry picture is taken using a filter made from a piece of film that I pulled out fresh directly from a new roll of film, so, out of the box, not used - just placed under light. I will take the two pieces and label them accordingly and send them over. Thanks!
