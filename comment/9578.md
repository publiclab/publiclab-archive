[@btbonval](/profile/btbonval) is probably right, the best short-term solution is to try to read the IR serial signal coming off of the HOBO devices.  That seems to be the point of greatest cost savings immediately and without calibration. 

That said, I don't think the weatherproofing is really that tough. [Rick Shory's Greenlogger] is just painted with a coat of clear nail polish. Its a problem that is being addressed by [@donblair](/profile/donblair) and [the Riffle team](/search/riffle)-- we can bake'em (evaporate all the moisture) and then brick'em (pot them in epoxy)  its very effective.  You can always pour silica desiccant into the box if necessary.  

For temperature, at least, the [NIST calibration looks pretty doable](http://www.nist.gov/pml/mercury_traceability.cfm). I could
