I would stick with the aluminum.  It's probably the most commonly used material for PM monitoring because as you stated non-conducting materials are prone to static attenuation.  It needs to be anodized aluminum though. 

Make a detailed drawing, find a machine shop that works in aluminum and if you order enough the price per unit will drop dramatically.  Anodizing can be nearly any color of the rainbow!
