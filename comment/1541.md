Luckily film strips are easy to mail around :-)

Just a couple thoughts: 

> I would expect a black and white type of image with all color channels appearing more or less the same. The reason the “better” image has a violet hue is because the white balance is not set up for dealing with NIR light. 

Ned i wonder if the Bayer filter R,G,B dyes are also differently transparent to IR, and that accounts for some of the purple color as well. For example, the strong blue in the images could be because the blue filter only blocks visible green and red, and they didn't bother choosing a material which blocks infrared because it's far enough away from blue and the IR-block filter would get rid of it? 

> post there reports to a web page dedicated to that? Maybe PLOTS could help with that. 

Josh's suggestion is good; also though Research notes are a bit more structured and visible to others so we could agree to tag notes with "irpass" or "infraredfilters" or something? For example all "NDVI" tagged notes show up at http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/ndvi
