Hi [@bronwen](/profile/bronwen), Thanks for the comments and connections. Our testing locations are also crowdsourced by our testers, and we'd love to have a more geographically diverse group that included more fountains near the superfund areas. I'll definitely look into events out that way. I agree with you about wanting to put more nitty gritty details about testing process as well as more big picture info for the uninitiated to understand the issue with lead in drinking water, how it got there, and what the health effects are. We _just_ finished the website, webforms, and backend infrastructure with a small group of us working nights and weekends since about this time last year, but we certainly have improvements and goals for the future. In brief, our testing utilizes a standard 2-bottle [1st draw - flush - 2nd draw] sample collection that is then tested by a lab certified by the NYC DEP. Thanks again for your comments and looking forward to learning more about your lead testing work.
