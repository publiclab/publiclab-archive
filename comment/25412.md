With the school year beginning we have some new instructors spinning up their own courses around the classroom logger released earlier this year.  Some of them are more focused on biology than we are so we did some noodling around to come up with a bio-monitoring idea that could be done just about anywhere with as few resources as possible.

[https://thecavepearlproject.org/2019/08/30/creating-a-normalized-vegetation-index-sensor-with-two-leds/](https://thecavepearlproject.org/2019/08/30/creating-a-normalized-vegetation-index-sensor-with-two-leds/)

The result was a ‘Leaf Transmittance Index’ based on readings from an IR LED and the red channel of the indicator LED already on the logger. Although using garden variety LED’s with no real spec introduced several non-optimal aspects wrt frequency & bandwidth, the trial successfully distinguished ‘healthy’ vs ‘unhealthy’ plant leaves where a simple visual inspection could not.  

Now, before all the bio folks jump on us for all the hand-wavy unknowns, and creating a pseudo NDVI with transmittance, rather than reflectance: keep in mind this was meant from the start to be a conceptual proof of concept, rather than a rigorous tool. From a teaching point of view, students would have to create "custom calibrations" for their one-of-a-kind builds & for each plant species - but that's actually a useful teaching exercise in and of itself. This fun little hack really has legs in that educational context, and it wouldn't take much to tune the idea to any specific application with better led selection.
