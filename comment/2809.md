You're like a combination Lucius Fox (Batman) / Q (Bond) / Merlin (Arthur)!  But, in addition, you actually *employ in the field* the tools you create, so you're also, e.g., the Bond to your own Q.  The most parsimonious explanation I can think of is that, like Merlin, you are living backwards in time and delivering us the fruits of your future research.

Incredibly helpful post.  I'm going to share all of your info -- circuits, parts lists, datasheets -- with Ben, and have a sit-down with him when I return to Amherst on the 28th. Will also look into the Yahoo Charge Controller Group.

And I'm going to want to hear the bank robber story at the next meetup.
