Yes it does have a filter! But if you use the Lego spectrometer at [#lego](/tag/lego), you can use a Raspberry Pi Noir camera with the Raspberry Pi version and it will not have a filter.&nbsp;

> I am investigating the possibility of using the spectrometer to measure THC and CBD content in cannabis. The idea is to use a dye like Fast Blue BB to couple to the THC and CBD. They produce slightly different colors so I am hoping to at least get a measure of the THC:CBD ratio. The colors are in the deep red spectrum, plus there may be some absorption lines in the NIR (unknown at this point). Hence my question regarding the webcam that is currently part of the spectrometer kit.

However, the procedure requires additional consumables, one of which is a mixture of chlorinated hydrocarbons (chloroform and 1,2-dichloroethane). Chlorinated hydrocarbons are health and environmental hazards so I want an alternative. In addition, the chromatography approach is pretty subjective -- you're looking at the size of the color spots -- so there's a lot of room for error.
