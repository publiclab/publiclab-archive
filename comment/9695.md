It's nearly impossible to separate the effects of irrigation hi-cap wells from the silica wash plants.
Also, withdrawing large amounts of water for sand mining or industrial farming
increases the flow of groundwater, both speed and quantity, and so, groundwater under these conditions is much more likely to pick up bacteria, nitrates, atrazine, and, worst of all, arsenic.
The St. Peter sandstone has spots of concentration of arsenic; there's a lot more in Eastern Wisconsin.  Nevertheless, arsenic is showing up in some places-anecdotal evidence.
