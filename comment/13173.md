HI Mary, I am not 100% familiar with methods of collecting oil from soil. I think [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) might know better. I saw he had some diluted soil samples with him at the Barnraising. Anyways I would approach it in two separate ways: 
1. I think collecting samples from frozen soil would be pretty much same process as collecting samples from not frozen soil. I would say just defrost the sample in a room temperature. Do not add more water to it. I would even try to dry the sample in the room temp, to get rid of as much water as possible. After that I will use the mineral oil which should attract the oil from the targeted sample. I would try to purify the sample to get rid of the soil remains and than try to measure the spectra. 
2. The other way around might be actually (as you are saying) defrost the soil and mixing it with more water. I would wait until the mixture settles down and than I would try to freeze it and collect oil from the surface with a cotton swab.
... another way might be adding a centrifugation process to help the filtering / settling of the soil particles.
