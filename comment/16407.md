Hi, Mridul - i was also thinking about how, if we standardize the way of storing the location information, we could then (to some degree) separate the code for displaying locations from that of selecting locations. Some code might be shared, like the grid display code. But other code might be quite separate -- maybe not a completely separate library, but at least written and stored separately. Maybe that's a good way to think about the two different lists of features I wrote above. 

Have you had a chance to try downloading and "building" one of the modules I mentioned above? I'd love to accept a pull request for one of them if you want to give it a try.
