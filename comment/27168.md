Hi Sashae,

I built my QFH using 5mm micro bore copper tubing. I noticed many build instructions on the net used elbow joints but I didn't fancy soldering those. Mine is made with two continuous lengths of copper pipe threaded through a length of plastic water pipe. I worked out the lengths of each section including the elbows and just bent the copper where needed. 

Love that image of yours. As most of our weather systems come from the Atlantic it is more interesting to see what is on the way.  I don't get a clear enough line of sight to get N Africa included. I will probably set the QFH permanently higher up now I know it all works. 

It's a shame the old Russian polar orbiters are no longer operational. They gave a bit wider view on each pass, though only in daylight if I remember correctly. 

Hope to see more people writing about their experiences setting this up.
