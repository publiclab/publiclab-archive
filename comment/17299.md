Hi, [@stella](/profile/stella) - i agree with Ujitha, perhaps you can add a bit more detail, for example linking to each of your PR urls, and talking about some of the challenges you faced. 

Another thing you can do is to copy in more from your planning issue in terms of the remaining tasks. After doing that, some of them can be made into new issues for others (or yourself) to solve later. Thanks!
