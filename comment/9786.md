Ok I managed to integrate the "booth" with the box for the rigid bench, and in theory they could both be made from the same sheet as the rest of the frame, although that'd make for a pretty large unfolded size. The laser hole may need to be doubled or something to support the laser while there's a bottle in there, or if we make the whole thing of corrugated cardboard maybe it'll be thick enough to form a shelf.
