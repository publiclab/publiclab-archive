Oh, that's great to be able to disable AWB.  I don't really know what manual setting would be best for your use.

If you are going to be swapping filters, some other opportunities arise. Neither a red nor blue filter allows both a pure visible and pure NIR channel to be captured. If you can take two photos every time you want to compute NDVI, then you can take one photo that captures only red and another that captures only NIR. If the IR block filter has been removed from the camera, an IR pass filter like Wratten 87 can allow only NIR to be captured. Then use a filter that passes only red to take another photo. Those two photos can be aligned and used to compute NDVI with two channels that are not cross contaminated.
