Hi folks, to keep this community bonding period going I propose we all get on a video call! Over in Gitter, we've been working on a proposed time of Tuesday May 23 at 10A NYC+Boston time / 7P India+Sri Lanka time. 

I'm looking to hear from all students: [@ryzokuken](/profile/ryzokuken), [@stella](/profile/stella), [@ccpandhare](/profile/ccpandhare), (thanks [@mridulnagpal](/profile/mridulnagpal), [@Ashan](/profile/Ashan) for already responding in Gitter) and all mentors:  [@david-days](/profile/david-days), [@Ujitha](/profile/Ujitha), ([@stevie](/profile/stevie), who is on vacation) and [@warren](/profile/warren). 

Also please check in advance if you'll be able to use zoom.us for both video and audio. Thanks!
