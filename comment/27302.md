This is a bit off-topic to the thread, but I want to give credit to [@stoft](/profile/stoft) for contributions from this thread to a project I've been working on for about six months on measuring cameras' spectral sensitivity.  Particularly, making the spectrum splay symetrically on the camera sensor is important, and what [@stoft](/profile/stoft) wrote here was instrumental to modifying my lightbox design accordingly.  I wrote about the whole project in a series of threads at discuss.pixls.us; the specific post describing the symmetry quest is here:  https://discuss.pixls.us/t/the-quest-for-good-color-4-the-diffraction-grating-shootout/19984/

Thanks!!
