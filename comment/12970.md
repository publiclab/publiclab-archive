Thanks [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) ... So, are you saying this would be a matter of using one camera with the blue filter and one camera with the Rosco [#19](/n/19) "Fire" filter ... and then overlaying and processing those images together similar to as described in this video? Or do you mean trying the blue and trying the red and comparing the results to see which works best?  

One particular aspect of this that I am interested in is whether it might be possible to think of this in a different way ... not just trying to get the best individual image at one point in time, but rather taking a series of images over time and processing them in a way that might bring smaller changes to the forefront by building upon subtle changes in the images from one picture to the next in a series. I'm not sure if that is possible, but would be interested in playing with the idea if it might be viable.
