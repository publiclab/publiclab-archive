Hi [@edie_blues](/profile/edie_blues) -- It is always exciting to see design refreshes being done and I appreciate the mock-ups + community engagement + iteration approach to this work that you appear to be taking. 

FYI: I am fairly new to Public Lab (only been involved for a couple months), so consider me that type of user. 

I have not put much thoughts to the dashboard except to say that it could use a lift, and I'm not currently confident that the most relevant materials/notes/conversations are being surfaced to me. Though, I did find this post via my dashboard! So I guess it's doing something right. 

BUT... A concrete reaction to your 3 options: My default is to lean towards facebook style layouts. People are just used to it. 

I'm curious if you happen to have data (site metrics and/or crazy egg type of thing) at your disposal. Would be interesting to see what the top user tasks are, or even how long they stay on the page (do people go there just to check it out, like facebook? Or do people log in with a task in mind). And then if you're conducting user interviews, I'm happy to volunteer time to that. Just let me know!

Thanks again for engaging us, and for the opportunity to react.
