Hi Jeff - I'm not sure what math you are looking for. For the gamma correction I use:

The first step is to remove the effect of the gamma correction
blueBand = blueBand ^ (1/blueGamma) [#Where](/tag/Where) blueGamma is a user defined variable - I used 0.8
redBand = redBand ^ (1/redGamma) ##Where redGamma is a user defined variable - I used 0.8

The get the value from the test target I take the mean of the pixels in a rectangle that is drawn by a user

Next I remove the effect of NIR recorded in the red channel I use red = red - blue * percentBlue # Where percentBlue is the percentage of the blue band pixel value to subtract. I used 0.8

The last step before NDVI is to calculate the formula for the line (slope and y intercept) between the two points defined by the white and dark targets - y=the reference reflectance for the targets and x = pixel value after gamma correction and subtracting blue form the red. If there are more than two colored targets you could use a linear regression to get the formula for the line. The formula for the line is then used to predict reflectance and the result is used to calculate NDVI. 

Does that make any sense? I can post my R script if that helps. 

Ned
