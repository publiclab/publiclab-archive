Hi Chris, what do you mean by a standard lycopene extraction? 

The UV spec of lycopene in ether can be found here http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00217-006-0541-4 with three distinctive peaks at 503, 472, 445 and another at 363. My peaks are at 502, 470, 444 and 366. My sample seems to have something else in there too, perhaps another carotene. 

I'm using a CFL and have calibrated to it. I wanted to use a halogen lamp but couldn't work out how to then calibrate it wrt the CFL spectrum provided. Is it explained somewhere?

I tried using water and alcohol initially - but lycopene does not dissolve in alcohol, and the UV spectrum in the lab showed it wasn't present in a filtered sample (using the methodology above). I'm looking into the quantification - someone at my lab is meant to be an expert in UV quant so I was going to ask him. If not, then perhaps trying to purify and crystallise and weigh is the best way. I've got more details of the protocol I'm going to try here https://diychemistry_food.pads.ccc.de/

Thanks,

Kat
