The current world population is 7,968,318,480. There are over 779,846,720 with no access to safe drinking water. Environmental science is a multi-branch field of study, its interdisciplinary. Environmental science is an important field of study because of the knowledge and studies we need from our water, air, and food considering we depend and rely on these things from our environment to survive. We should all take environmental science in consideration seeing as our future needs our help. If we don’t join the cause to help prevent unsafe water, toxic air, pollution prevention, and animal extinction we won’t have many options in the future and will be left with an overpopulated world and not enough sources to keep it going. It doesn’t take a degree or study in environmental science to help, doing the smallest things count and will make a difference. Our environment needs it.
