[@stoft](/profile/stoft): I support the idea of a review committee. Not for ranking but for advice. Makes much more sense in promoting the quality stuff and in advising the others how to improve their work. A gentle push here and there and an open talk about ideas and concepts let's things flow better than any ranking could do. For me the human factor is much more important than mathematical expressions of the quality or weighing of a paper. I remember the movie "Dead poet's society" where a teacher wanted to rank poetry for "importance" and "language quality" and put poems into a diagram. That's what I fear might happen here, too.
