Another thing that 1995 paper could tell us is why they chose 30nm as the offset to discard above the excitation wavelength, and more about the light sources they used (laser?). ResearchGate has a copy you have to log in (free) to see: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248337600_Visible_and_Near-Infrared_Fluorescence_of_Crude_Oils
