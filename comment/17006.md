The algorithm looks good. I guess the next question is does Infragram use the exact same algorithm? (only coders know for sure) 

The test image you are using has very similar histograms for blue and red which might be more likely to produce artifacts. You might want to use an RGN photo instead so most blue values are higher than red values. There is a good one here: https://publiclab.org/notes/Claytonb/08-13-2016/plant-health-ndvi-white-balance

Too bad I can't drag a photo into this comment.
