Environmental Science Stimuli That Can Adversely Impact Life in The Future
	There are several factors that can adversely affect life in the future. Those things consist of population, births, deaths, water, food, and health. The current world population is 7,968,543,900. The current birth of this year is 88,382,125. The total deaths this year is 37,105,021. The amount of water used this year is 2,847,218,647 liters. The amount of people that doesn’t have access to food is 863,056,807 and amount of people that doesn’t have access to health care is approximately 120,000,000.
	With, there are two major forms of the impact of so many humans on the environment. They are utilization of assets such as land, food, water, air, fossil fuels and minerals and waste products as a result of utilization such as discuss and water toxins, poisonous materials and greenhouse gasses, therefore births and death ties into population. Food can impact life in the future because according to my knowledge the birth rate is approximately three times as large as the death rate, which means that more land would be taken up and this could contribute to less food production, therefor food would become less natural and more processed, and this has been scientifically proven to cause cancer and other sickness due to radiation of gmo(genetically modified) foods. Lastly, water impacting earth, its quite simple, water is need for everything, to grow food, to harvest fish and livestock, and to survive. There are tons and millions of people that doesn’t have access to safe water sources, and we have already used 2,847,218,647 liters this year. It’s important to have water to survive but it’s more important to have clean/pure water to substantially survive.
