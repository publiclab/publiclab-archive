I think you are just right [@warren](/profile/warren). possibly one of the outputs of the initial planning phase should be a list of functions (and objects?) which could then be mapped out and divided in a logical way, maybe even some state machine flows?
Calling functions and objects from other Python libraries is not a problem and should be desired, basically, you just write a .py file and import it to another one.
