Hello Again! I'd like to thank you for getting back to me on my compiling problems with the 
Wheestat5_0 energia sketch;I've followed the instructions that you provided;I now have 
the following errors;      In file included from Wheestat5_0.ino:11:0:
    C:\energia-0101E0011\hardware\lm4f\libraries\SPI/SPI.h:58:11:error:extra
    qualification 'SPIClass::'on member 'trans2ByteA'[-fpermissive]
    C:\energia-0101E0011\hardware\lm4f\libraries\SPI/SPI.h:60:11:error:extra
    qualification 'SPIClass::'on member 'trans2ByteB'[-fpermissive]

 note: I added the definitions to the new renamed SPI.h file; I'm wondering if perhaps I've 
put them in the wrong place? Yeah,I know ...pretty pathetic for me not being very versed
in the coding end of things.....I'm at least willing to learn.My strong suite happens to be
hardware design...30 years worth and counting.Anyway,if you have time for some more
suggestions,I'd be very grateful! If I don't hear from you before this year ends, Have a safe
and very Happy New Year!!!  Regards, Mark
