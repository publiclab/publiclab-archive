Zorn,  
If you remove the IR block filter, the camera will take very strange photos because all three color channels (RGB) will have lots of NIR light in them. The colors will be very strange, and plant leaves will look bright. If you replace the IR block filter with a visible light block filter, the camera will take pure NIR photos. These have very bright leaves and can be sharp night vision photos under IR illumination. If you replace the IR block filter with an Infragram filter, you will maybe get photos that can be used for plant health information. See the note J. Warren mentioned above. Let us know what you find.
Chris
