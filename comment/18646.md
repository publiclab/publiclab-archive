Hi! Do you think you could flesh out (in smaller pieces) exactly what you'd be working on in a checklist of sorts? You could copy in stuff from the relevant Github issues, and link to them -- that'd be really helpful!

Remember: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-18-2018/software-outreach-modularity-is-great-for-collaboration

Thanks!!
