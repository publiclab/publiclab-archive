Observation of some basic system parameters will help define the limits.

1) A single stable source (Solux and CFL) plus the PLab-class spectrometer will allow determining the measurement limits.

2) 2D mapping of an example plant light source (testing a range of mapping resolutions) will find the measurement limits of 2D mapping.

3) Repeat and long-time measurements (spectrometer +Solux, +CFL, +PlantLight, +attenuatedSolar, +etc) will uncover measurement error limits

4) Monitoring a stable source while inducing mechanical stress to the spectrometer adds another error limit.

Identifying the various measurement errors, then allows making a set of measurements relative to a transfer standard (eg. a Solux) which means the data will have a known reference so future data sets can be accurately compared.

The smaller Solux run on 24VDC so power modules and achieve 0.5% stability
[ https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/04-14-2016/spectrometer-stability ]. PLab-class spectrometer mechanical stability is often worse.

Just a hint - Mechanical rigidity of a PLab-class spectrometer cannot be over-stressed and 'fixing it' later by averaging data generally throws away a lot of useful information.

Deciding how much data to collect is likely dependent on the above observations. If the plant light sources are variable, additional data might be warranted to allow finding additional correlations in the data. Look for repeatability, drift, synchronous and asynchronous noise and stability-related errors.
