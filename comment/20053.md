Chris, thanks so much for your input. That information about memory usage is invaluable. I will plan on the non-wireless route for now. Maybe with a Mayfly, I would have enough memory to integrate a wireless solution.

Thanks for the information on the TDS sensor! Some of the DF Robots stuff came up in my search! But I couldn't exactly figure out how to buy just the sensor and not the whole Know Flow. So thank you, and thanks for your insights about the TDS units vs. Conductivity measurement. If what we're doing is just detecting events (which is consistent with how the EPA has allowed conductivity measurements to be used) that's all I would really need.

Jeff, thank you SO MUCH for that list! I was hoping to find something like that. I did a cursory search of Public Lab, and read some wiki pages, but I did not turn up anything like that. I will let you all know what happens with this experiment!
