Fiberglas tubes are a better solution for most kites and don't cost much if any more than those solid rods. http://www.kitesandfunthings.com/Products/Fiberglass-Tubes-and-Rods__FGTUBEROD.aspx
Carbon tubes are best and cost twice as much. http://www.kitesandfunthings.com/Products/Pultruded-Carbon-Tubes-36__CFPULTTUBE36.aspx
