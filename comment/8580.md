I think most small Powershots use an IR block filter that is 8.9 x 7.9 mm. That's the advertised size of the BG3 glass filter I put into an A2200 and it fit fine.  I measured the filter I removed from an old A590 and it was essentially the same: 8 x 9 mm. The BG3 filter was advertised as 0.55 mm thick, and I measured the A590 filter with cheap calipers as 0.36 mm. 

I did a request for quotation at Alibaba for AR coated BK7 glass in that size and got some quotes, but they were mostly unintelligible and unhelpful. There is a [piece on ebay for $49 that he will cut to size](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Sheet-of-BK7-Coated-Glass-for-Optics-Work-New-Unused-/331039271512?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4d137a6a58).
