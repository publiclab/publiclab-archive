Great colormap! I am using MATLAB to calculate and create images based on the Infragram Point and Shoot (modified Mobius). When I compare my images to those generated using the "Fastie" colormap on the infragram.org page, I noticed that there is a small but subtle difference. Attached are two images comparing the website:

and my MATLAB script:

It looks like there may be some image processing being done on the website. Are you using histogram stretching, or a modified NDVI calculation? Currently, I am just using NDVI = (B-R) / (B+R).

Thanks!
