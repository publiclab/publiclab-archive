Hi Charlie,

The better we can represent the variability of the feature we are trying to classify the more accurate the result should be. In general. the more training data the better. 
I forgot to mention in my previous post that running a smoothing filter (I've been using a Gaussian filter) over the image before classifying it seems to help a bit. 
Now that we have a few (at least three?) people playing with classification approaches it would be good to set up a way to coordinate the work. I requested a web share from the Museum although that's probably not ideal since it seems people generally have an aversion to using them. The idea is to have a set of images that we can all work with and then we can post our results and methods to compare and build upon. Does anyone know of a better platform for doing this sort of shared/open research? I think a shared research platform has a lot of potential to produce great work.
