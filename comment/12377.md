The standard lens on the Mobius might be too wide to allow good analytical photos. But other lenses are available: http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/08-01-2015/mobius-non-fish-eye-lens-conversion

A red filter is probably going to offer better results than a Rosco blue filter for the reasons in this note: http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/11-01-2013/why-a-red-filter-should-work-well-for-ndvi

You will probably notice the critical error in that ELPH 130 conversion video when you get to the point where you remove the IR block filter. Pay attention to how you remove the filter so you know how to replace it.
