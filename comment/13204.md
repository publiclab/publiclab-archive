I hate to be pessimistic, but even a medium efficiency supply air filter is probably more effective in removing the dangerous particles (respirable, < 4 µm). You need both a high flow (0.5 to 2 times the room volume per hour) and a high collection efficiency in the range 0.2 - 4 µm. Bubblers tend to be quite inefficient under 1 - 2 µm. An additional problem is that there are many indoor particle sources that could confound your experiment (candles, cooking, vacuuming etc). However, the bubbler might remove water soluble VOCs which might be a good thing! I also think that the diatoms will have a hard time to digest the crystalline quarz, for the same reasons the substance is dangerous to mammals. Really sorry but I wish you good luck with future projects!
