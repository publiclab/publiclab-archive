Hey Warren, been working on some stuff for fetching data from your database and placing it on the cards so that we can now sort or rather filter...  with the view I had on the cards.. it would have worked, but then when we need to filter, it becomes hard... So I had to rewrite the code again... but it will be up soon... sorry for the delays... thanks!
