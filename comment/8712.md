Very nice.  
I suspect that the limitation on accessible wavelengths is due to UV due to absorbance by the plastic optics and will not be improved by using a photodiode array.  Starna cells (www.starnacells.com, a manufacturer of optical cells) only recommends optical glass down to 334 nm.  They have a special glass that they claim can be used down to 320 nm.  Below that, you need to use quartz.  Typically, manufaturers of uv capable spectrometers get around the absorbance issues by using metal mirrors and reflection gratings (instead of transmission gratings, like the piece of dvd).
Nice job.
