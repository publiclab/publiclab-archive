[@danbeavers](/profile/danbeavers) I am interested in making our data usable in court, but I'm also trying to be budget-sensitive.  we're looking to mail these around from house to house, and over the long-term our biggest costs will be related to logistics, not the upfront costs of hardware.  The automation option I'm looking at adds probably ~20 bucks to the finished cost. A solid case will add another $30.  While optional, these things potentially make packing, shipping, and operations more seamless. 

While a solid case and automation will add about a $50 to the equipment, if it prevents 10 or so mistakes over the pump's lifetime we'll have saved money:
Every time someone screws up and decides to either re-run a test with a tube reserved for the next user, or holds onto the pump waiting to re-run an test is going to result in a bunch of logistical rejiggering over here. It is also easy for someone to miss-pack a box and break something, or disconnect stuff that will need to be plugged in, potentially introducing more logistical issues. 

I'm not thinking about negligence so much as everyday carelessness-- no matter what we do even the best of users are going to screw up sooner or later and give us a headache, but we can design to minimize the chances of that happening.  If it makes our data look more legally admissible, all the better.
