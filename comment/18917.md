Hi [@tech4gt](/profile/tech4gt) ... i guess in the portal in 

Step 1 => you have to provide a Public link to Google docs . 

Step 2 => Provide some information on the proposal .
 
Step 3 => Here if you click `Share` , then only the PublicLab Team can view it (you can edit again !).

Step 4 => Here you can submit final proposal in PDF format .

I hope this helps . Thanks !
