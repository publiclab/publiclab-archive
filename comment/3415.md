It's good to know about the stacking process.  Thanks for describing this. I wonder whether another way to avoid the averaging of the grayscale image is to use the red channel for the red part of the spectrum (600-700 nm), the green channel for the green, and so on.

I don't know how Spectral Workbench combines the RGB channels into one to make the spectrograph, but I suspect it makes a grayscale image. This set from Spectral Workbench includes spectrographs from a color jpg and grayscale tif of the same spectrum. The two spectra are very similar.
