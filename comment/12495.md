What an eerie, apocalyptic place. This is what happens to golf courses when maintenance ceases. I hope someone is documenting the succession.

I have not experienced the "missing every other shot" with the same camera and SkyShield version you have. The first thing I would check is the CHDK remote settings. They should be something like:  
Enable Remote [ÔÅ¨] (selected)  
Switch Type [OnePush]  
Control Mode [Quick]  
Enable Synch [ ] (not selected)  

When Synch is enabled, the camera shoots on every other pulse, so that is suspect.

The mesh looks good in Meshlab. Did you sort the photos that went into the mesh so only the ones aimed downward were used? Did you also remove near duplicates? I'm just curious because I wonder what the best protocol is for capturing photos sets most appropriate for structure from motion. The SkyShield needs a mode for sfm to capture just the downward angles. But I don't know what angles are best for sfm.

How much helium does the helikite require? Any problem lifting the rig?

Cool result despite the missed photos.
