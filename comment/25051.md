I tend to use bright pink/orange rope because we find a lot of rope fragments in our samples here in fishing-land, most of which is white, green, blue, and black. Microplastics can come from the rope when it moves against against the side of a boat, wharf, etc, so taping/melting the ends is only one (major!) source of plastic contamination. 
Our lab is currently doing research into types of ropes that fragment more/less. I'll let you know more when we know more!
