[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) What do you mean with 'stretching the histogram of the infrablue photo'? Because if it means to reduce blue levels (increase NDVI levels), why doesn't appear the pinky zone in the streched image with respect to the non-streched?

Another doubt: What's the difference between an Infrablue photo and a NGB photo? I thought they were the same. I say it because of the bottom left image (in the text you explain that's a NBG photo obtained from the Infrablue photo).

Thanks!
