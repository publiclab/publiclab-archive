Posted updated designs on a paper insert for a conduit box design. I was looking carefully at your design in the process. Have you been able to test the film grating? I have some and would love to give it a try -- we are debating shipping slices of DVD in the kits vs. slices of the grating material. The kits to date have included a DVD slice.
