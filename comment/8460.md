This is a great draft proposal, thanks Anish! One note: the OpenLayers.Layer.Image class is not used in the current implentation; actually the "Cartagen" framework is used to place a region **on top** of an OpenLayers map, and actually intercepts all the mouse events. The Cartagen layer displays the polygons and warped images ("warpables", though in the revised version we should not use that confusing name) and passes on drag interactions to OpenLayers. 

However, this system is a cobbled-together Frankenstein and your Leaflet implementation should allow us to make a *much* simpler version. Ideally we stop using Cartagen as well as OpenLayers. The warping/distortion code you'll be porting will mostly be from Cartagen, though. 

Did you not want to include some notes on advanced tasks you might attempt if you make a lot of progress and have time left? Also, perhaps you should link to the relevant code on Github that we've been posting in the discussion list and the ideas page, so people reading over this description can see what Matrix and other code you're referring to.

Great work so far!
