OK, I apparently burned out my Trinket somehow, because I can't re-upload; but i have a 2nd one. I uploaded the latest version of the sketch (which should be at the link above) and it uploaded properly. But now I have to de-solder the LED and knob from the old one and move them to the new one. Tomorrow! Or Tuesday.

Excited -- i re-tested the full-brightness of the LED and it's mega bright. This is going to be really nice. One note, though, is that the cuvette in the current version is not up against the window, nor is the LED up against the cuvette. I think:

* the LED should be integrated more closely into the "stack" and up against the cuvette
* the cuvette should either be up against the window, or there should be a mask or "tunnel" so stray UV light doesn't go through the window -- just light from the sample. 

Anyhow, even at low brightness it's cool to see working --  check it out, [@tonyc](/profile/tonyc), [@matej](/profile/matej), [@liz](/profile/liz)! 

Thanks again Cort, this is rad.
