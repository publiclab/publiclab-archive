Hey Matt - well, not free, but as you can see the cost is going to be pretty darn low. 

[@Paquicamus](/profile/Paquicamus) - sounds awesome! Could you link to some of the methods you mention? Perhaps they'll influence the ones we're developing. In particular I'm interested in the nitrate method, though it's unrelated to the oil detection.
