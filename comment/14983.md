An update on the project. I tried using a piece of red tissue paper as a reference for setting the white balance, and it really helped. Here's the picture:
[![color_index_with_red_card_for_white_balance.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/142/large/color_index_with_red_card_for_white_balance.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/142/original/color_index_with_red_card_for_white_balance.jpg)

I think it will work for my needs since I can use the same tissue paper for all the images, but long-term something more reproducible would be good... too many hues of red in the world :-)
