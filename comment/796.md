Hi, Catherine - just so you don't get left out, some folks are continuing conversation over on the GitHub issue. I wasn't sure if you were subscribed there. Ug, the continual fragmentation of online commenting...

https://github.com/jywarren/plots/issues/131#issuecomment-5990177

A couple possible case study sites (as per your suggestion) came up today in conversation -- that of an unidentified "plume" at the Gowanus Canal where there's been some debate over what can be asserted and how the investigation should play out -- and that of last week's FarmHack mapping, where Dorn (the farmer/soil scientist) has some very specific ideas about what he'd like to be able to prove about the plot based on the map. 

* "plume" - http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/liz/8-3-2011/infrared-balloon-image-reveals-gowanus-plume
* Farm Hack mapping: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/5-29-2012/lee-nh-plotsfarmhack-meetup

I'm happy to make introductions to folks involved with those mapmaking efforts.
