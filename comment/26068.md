Hi I'm wondering does anyone know if you can stack the Adafruit Feather M0 Bluefruit LE with the Adalogger featherwing? My reason for wanting to do this is so that I can log data from a sensor and be able to view the data via bluetooth from a mobile device. Can I achieve this by stacking these 2 devices or is there a better, more optimized way to do it?
