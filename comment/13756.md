I used Everclear 180 proof (ethanol) and the point of a sharp Exacto knife to both tease the layers apart and remove all the dye.  The ethanol seemed to assist the separation of the plastic layers significantly (Vodka worked also but was quite a bit slower.)  Then to eliminate the aluminum I just added a few drops of dish detergent or Prell shampoo, and rubbed between my fingers,  The detergent just lifted the aluminum off and flaked it away.  Result was complete use of the whole DVD-R for making multiple gratings.  I also constructed a prototype spectrometer using the front surface reflector grating from the aluminum itself.  Seemed to work even better in the UV than the trasmission grating approach.
