We typically use the cloudy white balance or AWB. With this generation of filters it's not as sensitive to white balance issues as our previous formulations were, not sure about Public Labs' or other filters.

Ah I see, yes that could certainly add to the poppy look! Cloudy WB works well for NDVI with these filters.
