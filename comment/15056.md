Hi Chris,

Glad you've found the UDEMY course helpful! Actually, there's been a very exciting new update for Fusion that lets you directly edit .stl's without having to first open them in MeshMixer. I haven't gotten a chance to try it yet, but if you're familiar with MeshMixer that may be a good place to start.
