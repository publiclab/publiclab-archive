@ david-days, Hello, this is dhaffnersr, thank you for such a detailed and informative post. I am really interested to know what are some of your specific thoughts on some of the analytical work that I have done, all my procedures are derived from national laboratory standard practices, and I try to use as many lab grade reagents and compounds in my work whenever possible.

Thanks, David H Haffner Sr
