Thank you so excited to see Search Improvements beginning!
I search frequently, and i just tried the term `epa`

I see these Autosuggest results: 

[![Screen_Shot_2018-09-14_at_2.14.50_PM.png](/i/26547)](/i/26547)

What i like about these results is that it is much more clear than before how the different types of results are indicated. The header in the context menu is very helpful. Instantly i ask myself, why are only two users mentioned? I know that more then those two people have posted about EPA (see https://publiclab.org/contributors/epa). Why is is these two that are shown? Could the context menu explain `2 of X` users shown?
