Thank you [@warren](/profile/warren), this definitely looks like an awesome task [@tech4gt](/profile/tech4gt). In the past I experienced with using an AWS EC2 running python for image analysis so I could provide some perspective there if needed. I think that the most important thing would be to search for your bottleneck, if it's the algorithms and not the network transport then doing some cloud-based image analysis is definitely relevant, otherwise not so much. If, on th other hand you need it to run where there is little to no cell reception or to be standalone - you might not want to go there.
Have you considered using a single board computer with a GPU? there are even cameras with GPUs for <100$ see https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1602548140/jevois-open-source-quad-core-smart-machine-vision
I have no idea which libraries are available for image processing for Java, but be sure to scope that out.
Best of luck!
