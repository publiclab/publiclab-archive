In order to function and create proteins needed to survive nitrogen is needed. Even though it cannot be assimilated in its natural state, nitrogen and its different forms are all essential to life on Earth. When talking about nitrogen theyâ€™re different forms. Nitrogen in its natural state is a gas. Nitrates and Nitrites which are polyatomic ions consists of nitrogen and oxygen atoms. Ammonium is another polyatomic ion. While Ammonia is a molecular compound. But both ammonium and ammonia consist of nitrogen and hydrogen atoms instead. And in this PowerPoint, we will be going more in depth about each compound and their relevance in the ecosystem.
