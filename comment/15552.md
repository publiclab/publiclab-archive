Those are great answers [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) ! I think we should write both of them up as activities to be replicated in the Open Air initiative. The replication in GA was all three activities (making, device testing, body as sensor testing). I wonder about the ethics of inviting over a friend as a control though. 

I'm less concerned about the placebo effect because 1) for subclinical symptoms abatement is subclinical symptom abatement. "Side effects" are still effects. 2) people who will try this will have likely tried a million other things first without success--could we capture that as a way to stave off placebo effect critiques? and 3) because the assumption of placebo effect is part of the expert dismissal of self assessments when studies indicate lay individuals are better at assessing changes to their own health better than MDs. 

Do you want me to draft up two research notes to be set as activities on that and run them by you?
