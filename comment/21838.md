Hi, all! I just wanted to start by chiming in in response to [@joyofsoy](/profile/joyofsoy)'s input - i think we could very easily start out with one of your categories: `stories, issues, methods/technology/kits, regions, events`, and begin collecting them on a 'holding' page. [@joyofsoy](/profile/joyofsoy), can you start using a unique tag, like `story:frac-sand` to tag a collection of pages? 

Here's an example you can build on: https://publiclab.org/wiki/sandbox-4

Distinctly, we can also further develop the "card ui", here even. Joe, you had a sketch for a card UI from a while back and I wanted to see if you'd share a link or image? I think there's a lot we can dig into in the individual card designs. [@edie_blues](/profile/edie_blues) just for thoroughness would you link us to other places you've tried a specific cards design? 

I also wonder what the map would look like -- would it display a set of projects near where you're currently searching? Or near your current position? Would people browse using the map, like searching on AirBNB?

Thanks a lot everyone!
