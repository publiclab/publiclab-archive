Also, in case of FB, GitHub and google if we are wishing to have signed up directly with the providers we need to make usernames. I believe that asking the user about username and then about password (via temporary password email sent to the user via email as Sagar reported) is as same as getting the user registered through traditional /signup. That is why I am considering the user can register first and then link up through different providers.
