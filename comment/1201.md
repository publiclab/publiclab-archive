I'm just curious, why violacein instead of any other reporters optimized for yeast expression?

I've been using violacein biobrick as part of high school student synthetic biology curriculum, and it actually covers the weird kinks (slow growth, unexpected behavior and etc etc) you need to be prepared for when working with such a huge (7~kb) part, that's actually an operon, even among similar chassis selection (like different strains of e.coli).
