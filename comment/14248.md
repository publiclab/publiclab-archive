An inexpensive microbalance also changes the costs of running filter-based PM monitors, some of which are Federal Reference Methods for PM2.5/10. Currently its $15-20 a filter to do lab measurement + blanks for mailing, etc. 

Having a balance on site can potentially cut transport out of the equation and speed local analysis.   Making a DIY filter system still requires designing low cost impactors (or cyclones) and a smooth, consistent pump running off DC power, both of which are non-trivial tech developments, but the most expensive component is the balance.
