Yes, the Solux4700KSpectrum file contains Solux's 4700K lamp output spectrum, after a 3-5min warm-up period +/-200K on the center color temperature. In my related research note, I show that this +/-200K uncertainty equates to <10% intensity error in the curve data. So, any re-measurement of a Solux lamp would have to be made with a spectrometer that could significantly exceed this accuracy spec.

Yes, but not quite. The correction data is roughly 1x at 500nm so you would just multiply measured webcam spectrum data by the correction data to get the result. (With some spectra it might be necessary to re-scale due to the ~2x correction out around 600nm) However, because the webcam's sensitivity drops off rapidly below 400 and above 650, while the Solux lamp's spectra is broader, the webcam correction error becomes excessive (and also unrealistic because the noise exceeds the signal). To prevent the application of the .CSV correction data from creating horrible (and noisy) plots at each end, the calculated correction data has been arbitrarily "rolled off" using a cosine function. Doing so, results in a nice response plot for CFL spectra which then doesn't "explode" with noise at the ends. It also means it is best to indicate the 400 - 650nm valid region for the resulting plot. (The webcam data's valid range for intensity is really this limited anyway even though you might see some noise and signals beyond those limits.) These effects are all explained in the other note: https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/03-06-2015/plab-3-gain-correction
