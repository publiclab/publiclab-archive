Hey Glenn! Shooting word over from the Traverse City area. I'd love to collaborate and do some spatial/statistical analysis and get some quantitative results on Sargent's operation in Ludington. I'm guessing I'd use GIS as well as OpenStreetMap/Google Earth input. 

I'd be doing this as work for an independent study that I'm taking, so bear in mind that I'm currently studying & learning the methodology and such that's involved. Let me know your thoughts! Hope all's coming along well.
