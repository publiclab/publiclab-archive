Caleb Hall- 3/31/2022 MicroPlastics in the Blood- Three Points from the article and videos 

Article: 

        1: Out of a study of 22 people, 17 have been found to have microplastics in their blood. Some of which have been found to have 3 different types of plastics 

        2: In the future, the amount of microplastics in our blood will only increase as our production of plastic is also rapidly increasing.   

        3: Babies and children are more susceptible 

 to this particle and chemical exposure 

 

Video 1: 

             1: Microplastic has been detected in the blood for the first time, and about 80% of people tested positive for plastics in the study 

              2: The plastics can travel around the body and get lodged in organs, causing issues. 

                3: These plastics have been observed to cause damage and death to human cells. 

 

Video 2: 

           1: Microplastics have been found in placentas 

             2: These plastics come from everyday items like bottles, containers, and bags.  

                3: More study needs to be done to fully under their impact.  

 

Video 3: 

            1: Microplastics have been found in every part of the body, from the brain all the way to the excrement.  

               2: Recent used plastics can increase the number of plastics in the blood.  

                 3: These plastics can cause cell death and allergic reactions  

 

All 3 of the videos, and the one article, go over the same topic. Microplastics in the blood. The article is an overall piece that gives the most information. Video 1 and 3 both give us a bit of info about what the heath affects are, and video 2 is a quick overview done by a news channel. The article and video 1 seem to be the most informational pieces and explain everything there is needed to know.
