For regulatory purposes, the EPA doesn't actually measure the size of individual particles. Rather, they use a pump with an impactor. This pumps in particles of a range of sizes, and as the particles travel around the impactor, they crash out due to inertia based on their size. The particles that make it through the system (with a 50% cut point for particles of 10 um diameter or 2.5 um diameter for "PM10" and "PM2.5," respectively) are collected on a filter, and that filter is weighed. By weighing the filter and dividing it by the volume of air pumped into the system, you obtain a weight per volume concentration of particles of an operationally defined size category. A drawing of this method is included here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/pm#Regulation.
