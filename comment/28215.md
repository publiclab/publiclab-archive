Thank you so much for taking the time to share all this helpful info, [@DanielleS](/profile/DanielleS)! 

Totally makes sense that the more successful approaches often include different organisms that work together in a system like they would in the "wild."

Also thanks for specifically pointing out the importance of safely disposing of any living tissue that might have taken up contaminants. 

That bioremediation factsheet you linked--_WOW_! So fabulously comprehensive. I'm collecting resources on remediation of contaminated soils on an in-progress wiki, and will be sure to highlight this factsheet. (And I'll link the wiki here in case you want to add anything!)

Looking forward to seeing your work on myco-remediation approaches and applying remediation in communities. Thanks again!
