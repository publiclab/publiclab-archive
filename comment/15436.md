I think that for /wiki/riffle and /wiki/open-water, we should try for as much as we can appearing as activities, listed in the grids, as well as in questions, listed in a FAQ. Links to design files in Github sound fine, though -- but they might primarily have a home within an activity's "Materials" section (even if they're also listed in a convenient place on a kit-specific page like on the [Desktop Spectrometry Starter Kit page](https://publiclab.org/wiki/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0#Parts+List)

But I also like the early-draft approach Patrick's taking here! I've been prototyping an idea for including a FAQ entry at the end of each post in the [#evidence-project](/tag/evidence-project) blog series: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/08-18-2016/introducing-the-environmental-evidence-project-a-blog-series-from-public-lab#Questions
