That sort of worked: <a href="https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/4476">https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/4476</a>.  I cut out a 50 pixel tall horizontal slice of the Snowy Sky spectrogram and applied a Photoshop filter: Filter/Blur/Motion blur/angle=90/distance=50 pixels. The intensity graphs are somewhat smoother, which highlights the vertical pattern in the image. I assume the corduroy effect is some artifact of the lines on the diffraction grating.
