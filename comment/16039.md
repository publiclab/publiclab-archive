Some light passes through human skin, and near infrared light (especially around 800 nm) passes through more readily than visible light. Skin also scatters near infrared light after it has entered the skin, so near infrared photos of skin can appear whitish, waxy, glowing, and ghostly. Near infrared light is absorbed strongly by blood, so veins look dark in near infrared photos. So near infrared photos of skin can highlight veins that are not too deep under the skin. 

The best results for highlighting veins might be pure infrared photos. Such photos can be taken by either illuminating the scene with pure infrared light or by using a filter which passses only near infrared light. Cameras converted by replacing the IR cut filter with a blue filter will capture infrared and red light mixed in the red channel. Using a red filter instead will allow capture of rather pure infrared light in the blue channel. Using exposed developed color slide film or a Wratten 87 filter will allow all three channels to capture only near infrared light. Using a narrow band filter which passes only light near 850 nm might be best.
