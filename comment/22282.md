I added a comment; I think that at this abstract level, the assumption of conceptual mode is fairly implicit. The entire post is focused on proposing a way of approaching the issue; not the specific results for the product.

Yes, that is one of the values of a modular design. If the insides (the actual spectrometer design itself (slit,DVD,camera) is robust and well designed, the "housings" can be swapped easily.
