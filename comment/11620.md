OK, cool - i agree vertical orientation will probably work better, and OK, going to go for a letter-sized sheet; Nick, could you try to select final choices for thermometers (please feel free to order as many as you like, I'm assuming you're doing this with our research supplies budget?) balancing:

* small size
* high contrast
* adequate precision
* durability?
* good looks :-P

I'll start designing now based on the idea that the humidity gauge will be circular and the thermometer linear, and try to do a design that is a bit flexible. Which of the pictured ones are your preferences currently? I'm going to go with the combined therm/humidity sensor, and assume we can swap in smaller ones if we find them.
