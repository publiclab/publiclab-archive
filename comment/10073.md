I think the most basic would be a blue-red location-stamped color dot for temperature, just like [@WalkerJeffD](/profile/WalkerJeffD) put in his Kayak note, with some sort of legend option.

Most Riffle data is going to be interesting as an historical trend, and be fixed in a single point, so being able to scroll through data in some visuallly complelling manner would be great.  A labeled time slider with a numerical readout? Is that kind of interactive object too complex?
