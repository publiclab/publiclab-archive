node: Why do raw RGB values differ from calibrated RGB values? I thought calibration just set pixels to wavelength (nm)?

Hi again. I only had limited time to look at the code. I'm not great with Javascript. Two things stood out. First, it is a little odd that the original RGB pixel values (integer 0-255) were overwritten. I couldn't immediately work out where that happens. Second, I did see that only 4 digits are retained and used for the parameters. I'd have guessed that would be enough, but it would be interesting to see if the problem goes away if you increase this to ~6. Plus, it's probably easy to try?

Yes, legos are a great idea. Fixing the camera to the wood block and it to the velcro has quite a bit of give too. I'm in New Zealand, so I probably skip the international postage and push some wood (or plastic floor tiles) through a table saw for my next try.
