I am in Trinidad and Tobago. I have located the sensor outside, but sheltered from the weather. I am towards the eastern side of Trinidad and with the wind always blowing around easterly I will not be getting much in the way of pollution. It will be manly aerosols coming across the Atlantic, I feel (and maybe salt aerosols from the ocean).
