Hmm, how did you use the bike light to calibrate your spectra? If it's an LED, it doesn't have the characteristic peaks that the calibration procedure is designed to recognize. Are you doing a "custom calibration" as described on the spectral workbench calibration page? https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectral-workbench-calibration
