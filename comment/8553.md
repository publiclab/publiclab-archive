Nice use of reused materials in the steering jig.  I've done some limited off-wind flying with weighting the wing tips of my kites and attaching asymmetrical tails.

My techniques are based on [paul's fishing kites](http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/2-1-2013/how-pauls-fishing-kites-flys-wind) and rely on drag.  Shifting the lift of the kite is not just more elegant, it should be more efficient and have less effect on the flight angle of the kite.
