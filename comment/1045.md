the first print is rarely right-- I remember buying an expensive stereolithography part several years ago and having it arrive as a thin surface sloshing full of unpolymerized white goop (that I'd paid for!).

have you thought about posting it to [Thingaverse.com](http://www.thingaverse.com) and asking for help there?
