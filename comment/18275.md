Thanks for your reply. I am trying to measure the percent transmission of light as a measure of pigment concentration in the water. 

So if i capture screenshots using spectrometer using  different concentration then how will the graph tell me concentration. Is it the lower the value in the graphs for red is less concentration?

Thanks
