This article gives a good overview of the carbon footprint of electric vs gasoline/oil cars. https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-how-electric-vehicles-help-to-tackle-climate-change

The upshot is that electric vehicles have a lower carbon footprint than gasoline/oil vehicles, though how much lower depends on the power mix in your location.

Over time, power generation has been getting cleaner, and will continue to get cleaner as solar, wind and batteries become cheaper and older power plants are retired.

One more thing to consider: electric vehicles don't emit any pollution at the point of use (ignoring tire and road wear). So cities will get much cleaner as the mix of vehicles shift.
