<i>The quote is suspect. Unless the mine has been lined with clay or with plastic, internal drainage implies that the storm water and the wastewater ponds will be drained into the aquifer and/or ground water which continues to drain until it reaches the River. All water travels. All pits leak if not immediately they do later given expansion and contraction particularly during the winter months and when "freeze/thaw" occurs. Pollution knows no boundaries in the frac sand industry! Water (storm water and wastewater) travels, flocculants travel. fugitive dust travels. If mines are drained internally it doesn't prevent them from being "clogged".  "Waste" is really heavy industrial waste or sludge and should be deposited in a landfill specifically designed for that purpose. Monitoring wells must be critically placed around mines but even then when there are warnings, it might be too late to stop the interior drainage and mitigate the problem.</i>
