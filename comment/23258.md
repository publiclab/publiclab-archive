Hi [@BrandonFeenstra](/profile/BrandonFeenstra) ! 
I had a group asking me about the Dylos this morning, so I went to the AQMD website and found the report for it like the one you shared here (http://yourstory.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/evaluations/field <-- really useful link for anyone thinking about low cost PM monitoring!), but I was wondering if there's a report that does an overview of what was found on all of these?
