Hello! I like how you've looked to organize priority by "must" "should" and "could" -- a nice framework!

> Feature to replace an image with a newer one with a version number. (May 27-May 31)
> Allow multiple versions of an image to coexist ( Jun 1- Jun 10)

These are great. Do you have some ideas about how the interface for managing versions might look? Would it appear in a timeline on the sidebar? Some ideas could be riffing on GitHub's versioning of comments?

> Feature to select a time point and display images on the map corresponding to that time point. ( Jun 11 - Jun 18 )

Even better than a time point might be a time range! I think there are some Leaflet plugins for this kind of thing that could be good to reference and model on:  https://leafletjs.com/plugins.html#time--elevation

> Loading images on zooming to a region. (Markers replaced by Images on zooming) ( Jun 19 - Jun 24 )

👍

> Exporting a collection of images by multi-select ( June 28 - July 4 )
Ability to set the version of an image to be shown by default ( Latest version not default ) ( July 5 - July 10 )

This is a cool idea, and also i do wonder how we'd select the intended version in terms of UI. Thank you!

> Ability to create sets from groups of images. ( July 10-July 16 )

Yes... we have "maps" which are collections of images, but it's a `belongs_to` relationship, not a many-to-many. So, we need to think about how a Collections model in Rails might enable us to do many-to-many collections!

> Rearranging image order from the sidebar ( July 16 - July 22 )

Yes! There has recently been a reordering tool added to Leaflet.DistortableImage, and we are interested in how to pack in the various sub-tools 'bring to top' vs. 'push to bottom' and such -- into a compact UI, either in the toolbar itself or in the sidebar. Would be great to have your design thoughts on this too!

Thank you for your proposal, these are great directions to go in with regard to UI!
