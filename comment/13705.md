Hey Jeff, glad you found this useful, I believe the baseline noise is caused by the extra cell length (the glass test tubes are 2.05cm.) I am waiting for some quartz cuvettes I ordered to come in, which are the standard 1cm cell length, so I'll have to re-calibrate all my baselines when they arrive.

I'll see if I can find out the brand info on the UV flashlight LED's and the UV laser pointer, also this is the source I use to by a lot of parts, I like it because they give the tech docs on most of the parts you buy.

They have a good selection and it's cheap!!
