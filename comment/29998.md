The conductivity cell should take the place of Rx.  So disconnect the conductivity cell, disconnect Rx, leave the one of the conductivity cell connected as it is, and move the end that's connected to the intersection of r1 and  r2, and move it to the other end of r2 (the same one that goes to the coqui).  The detector needs to be the bridge that goes between the the intersection of r1 and r2 ( connection 1) and r3 and the conductivity cell ( connection 2).  The trick is- the detector needs to be high impedance.  This can be done with a number of meters- but you are detecting voltage at about 3000 hz.  Which is a bit of a trick.  You are also looking for a null, or zero.
