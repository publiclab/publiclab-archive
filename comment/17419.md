Firstly, thanks for elucidate my questions. 

Let me understand just 1 thing more. After purchase the components and to make "DustDuino" I would have to program the software and calibrate the sensor; or not, the "Shinyei PPD42" would be calibrate by the manufacturer? 

I ask because I know little about software programming. My graduation is in Social Science and Physiology, and now I'm interested to study environmental justice and active mobility in Sao Paulo.

Thank you again.
