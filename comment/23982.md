 Hi- I was able to make this work a year ago, but haven't tried since more recent updates (I think I was running 7.1 the last time I was connecting to my phone with Fi2). If the app isn't working as well with more recent versions we might need to start poking around for something else. Thanks for pointing out the issue!
