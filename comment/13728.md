> that continuous band on the blue spectrum gives poor calibration

Dave, I don't think it's quite accurate to say that they give poor calibration. They may result in a poor "fit" because they don't exactly match the intensities in the reference spectrum we use to calibrate. But the calibration itself will still be good -- it's the comparison with the reference that suffers.
