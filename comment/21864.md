 I definitely want to work on hacking the FEMA box of food that people receive in emergencies. Let's take the same box size and figure out what people in TX would put together. Also, I'd like to work on the DIY air purifier using a simple box fan and HEPA filter. This could be handy for people experiencing bad air quality from flooding. If we could either purchase the fan and filter out there, or even borrow someone's fan to hack, that would be great. We need to come up with an easier/less messy way to attach the filter beyond using duct tape. Maybe a roll of stick-on insulating foam strip to make a good seal and some bungies or velcro? Let's figure it out!
