Juan,

I only have a few minutes on the SX260 battery when gps is on (~16 minutes during test flight). I read the caution that if leave logger on, it sucks battery, even when camera is on. For my use, I can leave logger off, just have it geotag images when flying. I do want to see what one can expect for battery duration. I got a couple of 1600 mAhr batteries to complement the Canon 1000 mAhr that came with it.

Yes, the gps geotagged the images when using drone.bas, the chdk intervalometer script from conservationdrones.org. I ran it with their default 3 sec interval, but would like to see if it tags ok at 1 sec interval. As I noted, I learned that if shoot in continuous mode, the initial gps data is written to the subsequent images - so not useful.
