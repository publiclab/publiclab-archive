Week seven update: Almost finished with my research grant proposal! I discovered many new materials I can incorporate and worked with budgeting for them. I am exploring the idea of fluorescence microscopy for bacteria detection. I also came across the option to order Far UV-C LED light chips to incorporate in my project. After doing some research, I found that Far UV-C light has a smaller wavelength than regular UV-C light does. This makes it harmless to human skin and tissues and eliminates a component of my project that I was planning on factoring in!
