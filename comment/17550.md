[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) well isn't that NASA item a bit complicated. Here's an Instructable that mentions that process.  http://www.instructables.com/id/Low-Altitude-Environmental-Monitoring-with-an-Ardu/ As for your wind sensor, that is really cool to see close-up although I'm sorry it snapped. It does look precarious and I think you could create something better if you repair it. 

P.S. If you've violated any laws I'd love to follow in your footsteps. I suspect that is how the best inventions happen. :)
