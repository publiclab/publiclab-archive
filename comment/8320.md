I think it will be difficult to have a multi-thematic Spanish list. I guess people usually will go to the theme specific lists, even if they are in English. My second guess is that the laboratoriopublico list will be centered in balloon mapping and Spain, but I also agree that they can be a good introduction to Public Lab for non-english speakers.
It can also be a good chanel to present other non-balloon mapping projects to the Spanish (and Spanish speaking) community. I think other non balloon mapping projects are not that known.
