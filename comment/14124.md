The new filter can be put several different places:

1. stick it on the front of the lens.
2. Build a frame to hold it in front of the lens: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-18-2014/mobius-filter-o-matic
3. Stick it on the back of the lens where the IR cut filter was removed.
4. Put it in the square chamber between the back of the lens and the sensor. You can cut a square piece and glue it in there like in the photos here: https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/004/063/original/mobius_instructions.pdf
