[@warren](/profile/warren), nice to see a design from the West suddenly appear in the East! Sneaker-net variant of NC machining; hope the design actually works for you. If you can find some of the 'yellow' wood-workers glue you might consider a comparison test of handling and setup-times. Not meaning to push, but from your description, the yellow might help. I usually add a piece of black paper on the flat (between the slit mount and camera to help reduce reflections -- it's quick and easy with a bit of Scotch double-stick and does help. I mentioned it, but didn't show in in the photos.
