Thanks dhaffnersr, that dimension shouldn't be a problem.  Probably I will need to modify a bit the design, shifting the optics 5mm to the left should be sufficient and there is room for that inside the 7x7cm . Regarding the height, I will add a support for the webcam of the correct size in the final project.
