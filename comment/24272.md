 I wanted to share a set of graphs I made using a system called `hercules` -- https://github.com/src-d/hercules

It's designed for making a whole bunch of different types of graphs, but a few that interested me - here's one that shows the amount of code (i think measured in lines of code) colored by which person committed it -- here's the graph for `plots2`:

[![plots2-people.png](/i/32508)](/i/32508?s=o)

I don't like that, because it's by lines of code, a lot of the base framework code is credited to me --  which isn't really fair for a lot of reasons. Maybe i'd like one where the "influence" of old code wanes over time? I dunno.

Note that some of the biggest trends here - cliffs and drop-offs - are probably from generating and/or deleting 

Here's the same type of graph for `image-sequencer`:

[![image-sequencer-people.png](/i/32509)](/i/32509?s=o)



Here, i'll post more in a sec... and add annotations too!
