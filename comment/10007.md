Hey Don - I hadn't seen this for a while and it looks awesome!  We are just bringing our analysis system online at PhotosynQ which might be able to help you with the display and data storage end.  Contributing to the database is pretty straightforward, I'd be curious to see how much effort it'd take to get the riffle to connect to our backend.

Here's an example of a recent project where we took some data points around a bean field performing variety trials.  We were measuring stuff with our device the MultispeQ, but any device that sends the right kind of data to the right server will show up.  If this is useful let's see if we can connect!
