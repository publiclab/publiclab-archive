hi webjackologists,
i'd like to share our recent developments of another Audio based communication, and especially the bootloader for programming Attiny85. no more USB, no more drivers, just music...
the core of the bootloader is here:
https://github.com/ChrisMicro/TinyAudioBoot
developed by c. haberer and b. prakosa

and we have been heaviliy testing it for a synth-application, but i believe it can be very powerful for all kinda cheap and easy to use sensor applications.

greets from santiago,
