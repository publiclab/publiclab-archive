Loved reading this! You should have a Pinterest of programming quotes haha

`...Maybe in programming, like in life, we have to go through the swamp to learn something, and that's just inevitable...` is totally worth remembering when you go down a rabbit hole that leads to another rabbit hole!!!

This is a really cool way of thinking about asking for help! I hadn't thought about it...`"asking for help" is that it's just the process by which members of an organization teach and learn among themselves`

... I also feel like writing the blog slows me down sometimes but I am using it as a way to improve my writing which makes me feel like it's important! And you are not alone with the late blogs lol, I am writing the third one this week.
