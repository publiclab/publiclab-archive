So the Carstea paper is great for one particular reason - we've suspected that organic material could fluoresce and potentially interfere with our oil testing, and page 54 includes an overview of the organic material -- of which primarily proteins and humic substances fluoresce. Fluorescence from proteins is apparently an indicator of bacterial growth, while humic substances result from the breakdown of plant matter. Interestingly, Carstea cites research indicating that one fluorescence peak correlates with total organic carbon!
