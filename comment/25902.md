We usually get 2.5 flights out of our 80 cubic foot tank  (of 100% helium?) to lift the same type of balloon you're mentioning. It also lifts 1000 ft of line, and a point and shoot camera in a soda bottle housing rig. 

This means it's about 32cubic feet of helium per balloon if you're using a similar setup.
