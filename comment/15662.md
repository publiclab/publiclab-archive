There's been lots of talk of skipping the Velcro steps, and directly gluing/taping the blocks to the board. [@abdul](/profile/abdul) posted a build that uses [no wood and no velcro](https://publiclab.org/notes/abdul/08-11-2016/constructing-a-desktop-spectrometer-with-no-wood-and-no-velcro) but removing velcro would **increase** rigidity while removing the wood would **decrease** it. 

I wonder if we could explore a smaller change of just skipping the velcro, and perhaps another of knotting or otherwise trapping the cable to reduce the risk of [tugging on the camera](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-17-2016/stress-testing-the-desktop-spectrometry-starter-kit#5.+Tug+the+cable), which could throw off calibration.
