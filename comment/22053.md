 Hello to the entire PublicLab team,
I'm Álax Alves, a student from Brazil, I have just took notice of Public Lab through GSoC 2019 program. I have recently started to contribute with Public Lab's Mapknitter (https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/pull/363). I have great interest in working on the Mapknitter Rails upgrade, since I have experience in those types of migrations (https://gitlab.com/noosfero/noosfero/merge_requests/1438/diffs). I think I could be of great value to the Public Lab team. Along with that migration I plan on making improvements to the entire docker environments, CI configuration.
