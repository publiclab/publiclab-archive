It would be great to have a few paints that:

1. had reflectance spectra for 400 nm to 1000 nm,
2. were exterior paint,
3. were matte finish paint,
4. were available in small containers (pint),
5. were available from a national or global distributor (Home Depot?),
6. included very light gray, medium gray, and dark gray.

Colored paints have very interesting reflectivity curves:
