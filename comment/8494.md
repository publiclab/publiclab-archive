Anish - i'm going to paste in some questions and thoughts here related to how your project overlaps with [Vidun's proposal](/notes/xvidun/03-07-2014/gsoc-proposal-draft-mapknitter-enhancements). Some of these are for Vidun, some for you, but both projects will be related and it'll be important to figure out with Vidun where your work fits together, and how you'll each ensure that your work will function even if the other's does not yet work. And how they'll work together if both succeed.

  * Upload interface is a partial, which can be included in various places
  * Recent images also
  * Separate JS code files
  * Leaflet work contained in Leaflet plugin
  * Could upload function first be integrated with current system, but clearly mark where it would begin to work with Leaflet system once that's done? Via agreed-upon callback and/or constructor method?
  * Upload of each image to server completes with a callback like "imageUploaded()" which the Leaflet system can overwrite when it's ready?
  * Leaflet system, if completed, will need a) transparency, b) outlining, c) locking
  * new Bootstrap interface overhaul for MapKnitter could be part of Upload project.
