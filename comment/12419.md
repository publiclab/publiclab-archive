Hi Suiris, it good to see how filtering the tap water works. How do you take transmittance measurements using spectralworkbench? I am looking into taking transmittance measurements of a glass coated with a thin transparent layer. I would appreciate if anyone could give me a link to an instructional video. Thanks.
