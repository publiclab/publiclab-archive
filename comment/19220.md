Pollution comes in many forms and many of the worst contaminants will not alter the appearance so visible light spectrometers (i.e. PLab types) will not detect those chemicals. Measuring water conductivity and pH might provide a simpler and more sensitive measure. Note, none of these simple methods provides detection of specific contaminants or detection of contaminants which are toxic at very small concentrations.
