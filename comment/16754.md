Dear Chris & Mathew, 
                  Does the Rosco 19 Fire  allows the light spectrum from only 560 to 740 nm range? The Wratten 25 A transmission curves from 600 to 1000 nm, so i was wondering how these two filters are identical.
Also, i saw some literature discussed on the leakage of NIR into red channel after the modification. I suppose this is the reason we apply custom white balance.Am i right ?

I look forward to your reply.

Best Regards, 

Suman Ghimire
