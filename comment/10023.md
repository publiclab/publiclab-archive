Justin, this is ambitious and super duper. Thanks and I'm excited to see things progress! Commenting has been a need for some time, but do consider that if we make "publishing a note to PublicLab.org" an integral part of the process, i mean *really push* people to do so, then commenting would be built in. That's not to say it's the only approach, but could work. You know you can set up a draft with parameters: 

http://publiclab.org/post?title=foo&i=http://image/image.jpg&body=This is the post body

That could help in integration perhaps.

I agree supermap is a really big topic and outside the scope. We also don't need to decide all of that right now.

Keep up the great work and check out Anish's work! http://publiclab.org/notes/anishshah101/08-15-2014/gsoc-final-update-for-mapknitter-rotation-and-scaling
