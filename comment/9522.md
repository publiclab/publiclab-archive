OH, i see - you have NDVI running, but want to do NRG. Well, NRG is typically showing red and green in the green and blue channels, and in the current blue filter version of the webcam, you don't have a visible red channel. But you can kind of fake it by using your infrared as red, then blue as green and green as blue. [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) has demonstrated this here: http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/11-12-2013/red-filter-rising but I think there was another more clear explanation he did of how simulating NRG could be achieved with a blue-filtered camera. Chris, can you help?

Great lead image, btw, it's so clear to see!
