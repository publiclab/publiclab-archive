So glad you posted this -- i'm going to link heavily to it in the KS update I'm writing. 

By making the back plate a separate part, will we get to redesign it and remold it without the extra expense of redoing the whole thing?

Also -- chris, if you can definitively demonstrate that with a common-ish smartphone camera and an otherwise identical geometry, there is a much better but not 90Â° angle we should go for, i think there is still time to make modifications to the design before submitting it for molding. 

Brad - one more thing -- i was thinking the camera mount point might usefully be *extruded* and made parallel with the top, and notched on the inside to precisely fit a 1/4" bolt, such that the bolt would be held in place as you screwed the camera mount bolt in:

What do you think?
