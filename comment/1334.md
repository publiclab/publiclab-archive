Cool. i don't think there's a page yet but one like http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/uv-spectrometry or similar would be great. I've started tagging UV-related posts as "ultraviolet" so that should help.

Alex did some great work -- i wonder if the "cheap" solution of using the DVD-R reflective layer could be replaced with a purchased reflective grating -- i think they're called "holographic" gratings. Because the DVD material warps a bit. But it's worth a try either way!

My guess was that the lenses will absorb UV even after we've removed the IR block filter. So maybe a pinhole could work?
