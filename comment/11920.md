Super! Lots to think about here but one that floats to the top of my mind is: What would ODM need in terms of inputs to generate feature extraction and matching, and what would it return? Input might be just a collection of images, i guess? Would it return interest point matches via REST and perhaps therefore image pairings as well? MapKnitter could in theory submit a list of image URLs and get back a list of interest point pairings. 

Is there a standard way to checksum or identify interest points that have been found, so MK could store them itself?

If that could work, we could do it at low resolution and use it to organize images on the client side in MK. For example, we could do a rough placement, and/or we could auto-place new images which matched old interest points. 

Brain churning here... great stuff, Stephen! Thanks!
