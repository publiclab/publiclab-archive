Hi [@itm2017004](/profile/itm2017004) ! Thanks for a great proposal! Love your use of Wave and the recommendations, esp. for screen readers (aria).

Would you be willing to expand a bit on the "for printability" part? We had thought perhaps a separate template that's stripped down for print would be better than extensive CSS mods to the existing page. What do you think about that idea? It would still use custom print CSS but we wouldn't have to do as much hiding of non-print-relevant content, we could just have a simple page layout specifically for print. Thanks!

I did want to note this is user-generated content, so perhaps it's harder to enforce this kind of thing for assets/images that are not part of our core site code. But it's a good suggestion nonetheless!
