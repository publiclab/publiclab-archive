Justin, this is a great step you've taken.

From my own experience with companies that pay me for open source software, there tends to be this disconnect between in house development (which is paid for) and open source development (which requires practices like what you suggest).

Growing the number of developers is an important step. PL only has one paid developer and that's [@warren](/profile/warren). If you analyze the commits across GitHub for PL projects, you'll find probably 90% of all commits are his.

From my experience, there are three majors factors for getting open source assistance.

1. visibility: are people aware of the project?
2. passion: is the project worthy of devoting one's time to? are there yields that the contributers can make immediate use of?
3. learning curve: how much effort is required to get involved with the project?

I tend to address [#3](/n/3) by making portable virtual machines which carry the development environment, using deployment scripts to bootstrap systems (and VMs), and as you already mentioned, documentation. Documentation is helpful, but even the best instructions suck when the user has to spend 4 hours getting the software bootstrapped. Automation is key for complex setups. Almost all web service platforms I've worked with have complex setups.

For [#2](/n/2), we often see that open source projects that help programmers and software engineers tend to get a lot more attention; look at GCC, LLVM, and such. They are making dog food because they want to eat that dog food, they can make that dog food, and can't sit around waiting for someone else to make the dog food they want. The Public Laboratory community itself tends to attract a community with a very small percentage of people with programming skills. Even if they want tools and resources, they aren't well equipped to help on the software side. Some non-technical folk in the community have been learning to program and learning to use tools like GitHub. I applaud that effort!

For [#1](/n/1), that's just marketing. It is highly related to [#2](/n/2) at present. Most people who learn about Public Lab enough to pay attention are the kind of people who would be passionate about Public Lab in the first place. Those folks come with a low developer ratio to other skill sets. The GSoC projects market to developers who need experience and get us exactly that. The problem is those developers are not passionate about the project (#2), so there is little follow through after the GSoC program ends. There are, of course, some exceptions :)

As far as github and plots-dev integration, adding the noise from every GitHub project to the plots-dev list might dissuade people from being part of the list, choosing instead to subscribe only to the projects they care about on GitHub. That would seem to indicate that the list would serve no desirable function. Rather than use IFTTT to merge the two channels, it might be wise to specify why they are differentiated. I don't see any obvious differentiation right now, and I personally default to using GitHub exclusively unless I'm responding to someone else on plots-dev. The only advantage I see to plots-dev is that it is not project specific, so it could be used to discuss developer organizational issues exactly like this one.

Normal users don't interact with plots-dev at all. It is strictly for folks interested in development. When troubles come up, normal users email web@publiclab.org or post issues to GitHub. The good news is that we do see fresh GitHub accounts created to post issues to our projects, so some lay users are indeed creating GitHub accounts. Very cool!

It might be worth redirecting users to email plots-dev directly. Unfortunately plots-dev would start to get a lot of spam that is not actionable by developers, for example fixing this account or that research note. Many user requests require IT management (and access to the production systems) rather than software development. Subscribers to web@publiclab.org serve as curators who can and will create issues on GitHub where appropriate or deal with the IT problems as appropriate. I'm curious if this is something we should think about changing though. I like curation, but it's clear to me that how things work are not being made transparent.

To address one of your bullet points with respect for plots2, I think we need to drop a lot of custom code and replace it with external libraries that serve the same function. Our wiki features are an example of something mostly hand written that I suspect could be replaced by more comprehensive gems. I could be quite wrong though. I'm not familiar enough with the RoR space to decisively say what I'm saying. I know in other platforms, many of the features and functions we have already exist as external libraries with almost no integration work required. I do not get that sense for plots2.

I think it is very important to improve the state of the software paradigms raised in this note. Keep in mind, however, that the development community might not be small because of the software organization itself, but rather because the people with strong software skill just don't care enough about the cause. Regardless, lowering the barrier to entry reduces the need for that passion (although it is unlikely to breed any sort of long term engagement).
