Hi Suman - Using Analyze => Measure should work. It's not uncommon to have high pixel values for bright targets. In fact if the exposure isn't set well the brighter targets are easily saturated at 255. If you have calibration target images with a lot of pixels at 255 they have almost certainly saturated the sensor and it would be best to retake those photos with a lower exposure value to create a darker image using a faster shutter speed,  smaller aperture or lower ISO speed.
