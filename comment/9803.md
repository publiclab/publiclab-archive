1) yes
2) there's not enough light, so perhaps angling the laser a certain way, or shining it through at the right level would help, so that the camera -- slit -- fluoresence lines up. 

if this is the problem, perhaps it's a laser with low battery, or a slit that is too narrow.    i can work on those to see if that fixes things. 

perhaps it's a larger, camera problem, tho.  



3) i have had this problem before.  this is a question for jeff, because he got this all to work at parts and crafts. i'm not sure what is different.
