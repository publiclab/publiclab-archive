 This is great! Indeed, this is a good approach, although I found that not all computers could use an internet gadget either without drivers, it's so frustrating! In any case, would you be interested in writing an install script for this based on the tutorial you've cited? We could build it in automatically so that the Pi works over USB /and/ WiFi in our default image?

You can read more about our pre-made image workflow at https://publiclab.org/pi-builder, and if you're interested in contributing, we'd love your help!
