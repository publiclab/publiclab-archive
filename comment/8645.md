Jaco,

The fact that your camera now focuses only in certain ranges suggests that the sensor is the wrong distance from the lens. At the factory, the screws through the sensor plate were adjusted to hold the sensor plate a particular distance from the lens and perpendicular to its axis. You have to recreate that position when you replace the sensor plate. If there were springs under the sensor plate, this can be even more important. It is possible that tightening or loosening those last screws will fix the problem.
