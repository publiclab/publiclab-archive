Short answer is NO ... longer answer is still no but with some reasons behind.

In general the EPA (and any other regulatory body) needs A LOT of convincing to certify anything and it is usually left to the manufacturers to do that certification and that's why "low-cost" and "certified" tend to not go together.

Now, that's not to say that the PA (and many other similar tools) don't give useful information, they do and in my experience, the general public value more having "some" data than how many stickers the instrument has. This of course means that it is inevitable to have, at some point, a discussion (argument) with local regulators about the quality of the instruments being used by the community and the way we spin that is that "non-certified" data can be useful in identify potential problems that may require further investigation with "official" tools.

As I said, the answer is still no, but that hasn't really stopped anyone from using them to throw numbers at the authorities to get them to investigate a particular issue.

Disclaimer: I work in NZ so I don't have direct interactions with the US EPA but the issues are the same everywhere.
