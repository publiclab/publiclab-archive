This is a great question! Yes, to a certain extent you can trace contaminants back to the source. You can do this with a combination of approaches and both are typically needed if this is potentially a legal situation: 1] fate and transport modelling of releases from the source (ie- a plant or factory) to predict where the pollutants released from industrial emissions would end up  and 2] taking samples (air, water, soil depending) and analyzing them by GC/MS as [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) suggested. Finding black carbon, which is a by-product of burning diesel fuel, hints at pollution from big rigs and manufacturing whereas finding silica or chloride ions suggest natural sources, for example.
