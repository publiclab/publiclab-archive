I have recently bought Mobius Action Camera - Factory Modified Infrared from Public Lab store.....i have a DJI phantom 3 professional version..i have somewhat attached the camera to the drone through some straps (no gimbal attachment). When i fly the drone in the field i saw there are some distortions in the image....i suppose the camera is stable but how can i correct those distortions? 
I customized the action camera to take timelapse every 1 sec to take continuous photo of banana farm. My mission is to stich those multiple image using Agisoft and compute the NDVI...I tried to stich but the quality of stich is poor due to the distortion.Please suggest how can i minimize such image distortion.

Thanks in advance
