hi cfastie,

yeah, continuous forest, but really there's no such thing.  Plenty of gaps to work with, but really good to know the balloons don't put up with much abuse.  I'll pick up some extras.  I've been discussing the project with some of the ecosynth folks here: http://ecosynth.org/forum/topics/has-anyone-used-a-balloon-setup
