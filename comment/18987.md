<blockquote>I'm eager to see how we might test out scheduled-sending emails in a 'test mode' before bringing the entire system online. Maybe an email that's sent only to me, hard-coded in, or just to users who have a certain user tag? Then we can bring online the more complete system piece by piece.</blockquote>
For doing this in the actual app we first need to migrate to rails 4.2 so that actvejob functionality could work. After porting to rails 4.2 we could follow the exact steps as I did in the demo app to integrate activejob, resque and whenever. For testing purpose we could send mails to certain selected user (as suggested) with certain tags (e.g. tester). Currently the demo site (having activejob functionality) sends mails every minute(the testing could certainly be turned off by user).
