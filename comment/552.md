Now have my program fully working, seems to do what I want it to do.

Issue now is the fact that the 3 colour LED doesn't mix fully, if you have all three on then you have distinct spots of red, blue and green.  Looking around now for a lens that will mix them correctly, so that get the actual colour over the entire area, rather than just where the three colours happen to mix.
