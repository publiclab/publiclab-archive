SUMMARY

In class after picking out what we wanted to do on our project, we discussed how we wanted to pick up the trash around Lake Pontchartrain. After seeing how we wanted to find trash, we were divided into 5 groups and we picked different locations to start finding trash. We used Google Earth to map out our collection sites.  We used the measure tool in Google Earth to choose 0.25-mile collection distances along the shore of Lake Pontchartrain.  One person from each group went out to collect the trash and timed how long it took to collect trash at each site. After the person found the trash they brought it home, weighed it, sorted it by category (plastic, styrofoam, paper, glass, cardboard, metal, and rubber), and took pictures. After getting all the information the person who went out to find the trash wrote the information on a piece of paper and brought it to class. After each person brought their information to class, we remained in our groups and we were all given a task to complete. Some of the tasks were to create charts, write summaries, calculate average weight per mile, and propose solutions. We collected a total of 251 pieces of trash at the discussed locations and approximately 40% of them were plastic. Our goal was to find out how much trash is along the shoreline of Lake Pontchartrain. Based on our data, we estimate that 464.64 pounds of trash would be found along southshore of Lake Pontchartrain (24 miles).

ESTIMATES for Southshore of Lake Pontchartrain (based on collected data):
464.64 lbs of trash along 24 miles
4,819 pieces of trash along 24 miles





PROPOSED SOLUTIONS:

- Spread awareness
  - Make posters and hang them around Lake Pontchartrain to make a team of people that can collect the trash together. Then we could reuse the trash and make bracelets and other jewelry/clothes.
  - Make a petition to raise the fine for littering
- Recycle more
  -Add recycle bins along the popular areas of Lake Pontchartrain
