Dear Ned, 
              First of all i would like to appreciate and thank you for posting such an interesting research article. I am typically in dilemma regarding the spectral calibration of my mobius action cam (87 mm wide angle with Rosco 19 Fire red filter modified from Public Lab). I have scanned some Reflectance targets like (white A4 paper, green targets, red targets, packaging brown paper, foam for packaging) with Spectroradiometer (which has range 0-860 nm). 

By spectral calibration, as i have understood so far, its changing the white balance settings of my mobius action camera through the gain and offset that i would obtain from the regression equation. 
Also, the value you applied like Ref400, Ref900, how do you exactly find that. For my work ie.> using Red filter, i have Blue (NIR) and Red is collected in Red channel, so which reference wavelength should i potentially use for calibrating my Blue(NIR) and Red Channel.

 You mentioned in a comment above that using Sandbox is fairly easy, how exactly i do this. 

Thank you. I look forward to hear from you .

Best Regards, 

Suman
