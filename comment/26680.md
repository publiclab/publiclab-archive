Oh cool, i like this! Is this at the end of the built-in woofmark toolbar? 

Also imagine adding a zoom level to the map; and, could we see a preview of the map at that zoom level as you enter the coordinates? That's a pretty complex thing to set up, so it might be a "stretch goal" or something to aspire to late in the project, so to speak. Rather than being something to try to tackle early on. We could aim for a simple mapping between HTML and markdown first, and build on it once it's working in a basic mode. 

Thanks!
