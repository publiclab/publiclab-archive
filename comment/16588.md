Yes, we are going to change the pixel values in our photo. For each pixel in the photo we have taken of vegetation, we use the DN in the red channel to compute a new value using the regression in Figure 4. This becomes the value in the red channel of a new image. We do the same for the channel used for NIR. These new values should be an approximation of the radiance (energy) in specific wavelength bands (red and NIR) coming from each point in the scene  Then the values in those two channels can be used to compute NDVI for each pixel.
