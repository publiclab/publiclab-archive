Hola [@nanocastro](/profile/nanocastro)! üôå  I don't know so much about Open-Flexure, but I'll love to play with one üî¨ 
And the nitrate determinator looks very good! 
The activities of [@Co-Sensores](/profile/Co-Sensores) are incredible. It would be a pleasure to talk to you and contact the "Vigilantes del Agua"
   with reGOSH. ü§ù 
Thanks!!!
