 Good catch [@MaggPi](/profile/MaggPi) ! I've made a quick search on the topics you mentioned, I hope it helps.

-Environment Monitoring IoT: in terms of software, EdgeX Foundry Project (https://github.com/edgexfoundry/) by Linux Foundation might be interesting, since it is a unifying platform for several different kinds of IoT sensors, in which they only send a signal if a problem is detected, saving a lot of unnecessary data. In terms of hardware, it could be interesting to integrate a scalable platform with a strong open source support, such as Open Compute Project (https://github.com/opencomputeproject), by Facebook.

-Microscope: Since you mentioned SONYC, I tried to find something more focused on images. Tensorflow has a project called Inception-v3 (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/image_recognition and https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/inception) for image recognition using machine learning and training resources from ImageNet (http://www.image-net.org/). However, since it provides complicated classifications instead of a true/false based on certain parameters, it might require extensive work to adapt it.
