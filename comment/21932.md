I use RAW pixel values for calibration analysis and since white balance doesn't impact RAW values I don't usually worry about it. If you want to use the JPEG data then you can experiment with different white balance targets. I'm not sure what you mean by a red/white surface. To set white balance I would use a homogeneous surface like a red card. Chris Fastie (cfastie) is the king of white balance and he might have some better suggestion.
