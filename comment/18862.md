I also think some other tasks to consider might be:

* ensure multiple format access: json, rss, etc for legacy endpoints that have these
* consider refactoring more of the SearchService and Search endpoint to improve/standardize the web search function: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/master/app/api/srch/search.rb + https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/2421

Thanks!!
