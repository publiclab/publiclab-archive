I think the 405 nm ones may be enough -- this looks like fluorescence just like crude oil, so we'd only be measuring >400nm light anyways. The image in the paper from Scott's original post cites 517, 559 and 577nm as important wavelengths to watch - those are in the green range, actually the region our spectrometer does best!

Exciting!
