The settings I used for the above time lapse, from the config file for mobius camera:

    Photo Set Time Lapse Shooting=[8],0:off,1:0.25s,2:0.5s,3:1s,4:2s,5:5s,6:10s,7:30s,8:Custom
    Photo Time Lapse Shooting Customized Value=[6]    ; in minutes, values from 1 to 43,200 (30 days)
    When time lapse shooting set to 5Min or above, Mobius will work in power saving mode (auto turns on/off).
