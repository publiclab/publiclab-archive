[@Claytonb](/profile/Claytonb), This is a great post and comparison. I have a couple questions, I'm using the V2 NoIR Raspberry Pi camera and [#2007](/n/2007) filter they provide is a good place to start with this but really isn't ideal it seems if you want anything better than an estimation as it doesn't have great blue transmission. What is the advantage of using the red + IR bandpass rather than the BG3 Blue + IR filter other sites recommend and what would the small threadless filter cost me? Also, I understand why you would want to subtract the IR leakage in the red channel but is 40% a number you got from the reflectance calibration or just a rough estimate? I would be very interested in how you came up with that. Thanks for the post!
