Hi Jeff,
I plan to have some of my students make a few simple pcbs to introduce the eagle software and teach some quick and dirty fab methods.   I think that the breakout boards that you originally requested would be appropriate for this demonstration.  Are you still interested in such a thing?  If so, I could post eagle files and could send you the boards that the students make.
Also, the board layout in the eagle file that you link to does not look like the layout in the Fritzing diagram.  This is important if you want the jumpers to line up correctly.  Assuming the eagle file is correct, the jumper has four holes in a line on 0.2" centers.  The Fritzing diagram has five holes on 0.1" centers.  I am going to assume the eagle file is correct unless I hear otherwise.
