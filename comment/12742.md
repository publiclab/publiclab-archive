Here are some photos of another scale version. At the bottom is a new idea I want to create, but just parking for now.

This model has a narrow "nose" that would require the block be secured with tape to keep it from sliding around. It's also not at the right angle, etc. and was mainly made as proof of concept to see how strong it was.

Answer is, pretty darn strong, due to the triangular design. Definitely some thoughts to improve it as a box, as in tab placement, etc.

But the main design goal, that it fit on the dead space on our existing die, seems withing range.
