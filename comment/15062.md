I also had a chance to make some changes to the leg bracket, which I have updated in Thingiverse. The primary change I made was to the bulge in the sculpt mode, which you should be able to find in the timeline as a purple box. If you open the f3d document and right click the purple box then click edit form, you can go in and edit the shape of that bulge.
