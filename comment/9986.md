Thats good to know, and definitely something to keep an eye on.  Still, my concern is not that the FAA will suddenly start requiring kite licenses (although that would make for great late night comedy material), but rather that certain interests will take advantage of the rulemaking process to regulate *aerial photography* in any form regardless of the vehicle.  They would do this by narrowing the definition of "hobby" photography to a case by case basis, (only of your personal property, with signed release etc...) while everything else would be assumed to be commercial, requiring an expensive permitting process.  The result would be all but a few "professional" contractors could afford the legal fees,  would be left out of the process.
  Before I come off as sounding overly conspiratorial, I should add that I don't think there's necessarily an evil villain somewhere rubbing his palms in anticipation of the day he finally controls the lucrative aerial photography industry.  Rather it could be the result of various competing interests aliging in a way that leaves nobody satisfied.  Copyright law is a good example of such a scenario...
