Pat,
That's a nice series of the construction site. It will be good to see those lined up in a sequence of some kind.

That's the first time I have seen the Redstone fly! I can't tell from the video, but it looks like your two attachment points for the Picavet line are really close together. I generally attach the two hangups or clips about five to six feet apart along the kite line. 

Maybe your kite was the "highest obstacle" so the plane should have been 1000 higher than that.
