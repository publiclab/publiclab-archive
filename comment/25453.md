Hello, I thought I'd chime in after your shout-out of the work we're doing.  Our OpenFlexure eV software does attempt to get as close as we can to manual control over the Raspberry Pi camera.  A few things that might help clear up some confusion:

1. the picamera library does not yet support changing the analogue gain or lens shading correction.  However, I have a fork (and a merge request) that adds these features.  There are good reasons it's not been merged yet - but if you want to use them you can find them here:
https://github.com/rwb27/picamera/releases/tag/v1.13.1b0

2. the picamera.array submodule is great, but beware that anything except PiBayerArray is not actually raw data.  That is made clear in the docs, but it's easy to forget about.

I really should tidy up what we've done into some neat, easy-to-extract scripts along with the manuscript, and I hope this will be done soon.  I am working on the manuscript today, and it is finally getting there!
