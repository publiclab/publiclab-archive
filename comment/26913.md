Good question [@liz](/profile/liz) ! I did this and the order in which the images are selected does not make a difference, at least in this case the result is always the same, and not optimum as the two examples show above. I did notice though that there appears to be a default 'original' layout (see pic [#2](/n/2) above), and no matter if the images are locked in a different layering, as soon as I move between tabs (About, Images, Export, Chat) it reverts to the original layering. So it makes sense that it also reverts to that order when exporting. [@warren](/profile/warren) and others just put the layer button back into Mapknitter a few weeks ago, maybe it doesn't communicate with the lock command?
Also, the small vertical menu in the upper left corner that includes the download and trash buttons seems to have disappeared for me. It re-appears if I log out and shut mapknitter down, but after working a while it disappears again.
As always, thanks so much for everyone's help/guidance on these issues.
