This is the best story ever of jumping into a Public Lab tool and making it better. This great video should be embedded in the research note above: [http://thermalflashlight.weebly.com/our-story.html](http://thermalflashlight.weebly.com/our-story.html).

Really well done.

If you had to do three things to make your flashlight even better, what would you want to do?
