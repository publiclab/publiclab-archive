That looks cool. I will start a print when the current Aerobee Rig camera tray print is done. It looks like the walls on the outside of the angled tubes might be a little thin. I'm not sure why that is but maybe the leg tubes are splayed out more than they were? Although the footprint of the part should stay the same size, the part can get wider near the top. So more material could be added where it will strengthen the end of the tubes which is where cracks will start. Those tubes for the legs really need to be surrounded by a lot of plastic.

Also, the wall in front of the horizontal tube is so thin that a hole appears there after slicing:

In fact, two holes are needed in that horizontal tube. Note the set screws in that tube below. They are to prevent the inserted tubing from rotating (adds to the protective value). So the model should have those 1/16" holes. Note that they should be at an angle so the screw can be reached when the bracket is in the position shown. That will be tough with your current model.

Sorry for all the obsessive details. But while I'm at it, when the brackets are mounted back to back on the Aerobee Rig, there is not quite enough room for the heads of the screws at the arrows below. This could be fixed if each bracket had a small indent for each screw in the base along the horizontal bracket.

I'll stop now.
