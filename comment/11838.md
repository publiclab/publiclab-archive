Because I don't really know much about filters, I came across this company named Agribotix that do NDVI and below the next paragraph is their explanation  on how they do it
Does the software here at PublicLabs does this kind of analysis too ?  Can these be compared ? Any comment on the way this company is doing it ?
Thank you

How do we do NDVI?

We use the NIR and green channels. Traditional NDVI, developed by NASA for satellite images, used NIR and red. However, at lower altitudes there is no significant scattering of the shorter wavelength light so green works just fine. We usually use a variant of NDVI, called DVI, which we find stands up the better in ground truthing. In DVI, rather than normalizing by the sum of the NIR and green, we expand the histogram. It is sort of the same thing as normalizing, but from lots of hours spent walking through muddy fields we find the results are more representative of the crop on the ground. Of course we can process your images using the NDVI algorithm if youâ€™d prefer.
