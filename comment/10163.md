Hey Greg -- neat ideas!  

Re: compiling errors -- just to make double-sure:  are you using the version of the RTC library linked to here: https://github.com/walkerjeffd/riffle-ito-apps/ ?  We're using a particular fork of the RTC library, so maybe that's the issue?

I can't think of a good reason for the library not compiling on an UNO, unless we're running into some odd issue regarding Arduino IDE versions or something; I'm away from my main computer, but I'll let you know what version worked for me as soon as I can get to it, and make sure that I've described the proper libraries to use :)

Meanwhile, since the UNO doesn't have the requisite hardware for running the real time clock anyhow, you could simply drop all references to the RTC library in order to play with data formats.  As you say, what you're doing right now doesn't seem to require having the microcontroller sleep (you're plugged into USB, yeah?); maybe a simple first pass would simply be using e.g. the millis() command to get the elapsed time, and using that in lieu of a timestamp?

For further debugging convo, it might be good to switch over to the associated github repo, here:
https://github.com/OpenWaterProject/riffle/issues/1

(I created an issue by copy-pasting your text)

Hope to be able to send you an actual Riffle device soon!
