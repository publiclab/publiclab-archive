[@jjcreedon](/profile/jjcreedon), thank you!   Are you still using buckets today?  I'd love to hear more about your experiences.  I've been reading up on Tonawanda Coke and Citizen Science Community Resources, it's really inspiring to hear about success stories like this!  I'd also be interested to hear about follow-up soil testing and remediation work you've been doing since the plant closed. 

If you're open to talking to me about this project, I'd love to set up a time to chat.
