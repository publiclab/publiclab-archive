I would think that you should try to just use the grating (DVD) without the slit and see what it looks like. The image may be post processed to provide a usable spectrum.  Let us know what you come up with.

http://www.skyandtelescope.com/resources/proamcollab/3307266.html?page=2&c=y may give you some ideas on how to proceed.
