In 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act to remove toxic substances from water and to keep it clean which impacted the Camp Lejeune lawsuit because the marines and their families on the camp was given contaminated drinking water. Fuel was dumped in the drinking water in the community. At camp Lejeune testing found that the drinking water had benzene, trichlorethylene, perchloroethylene and more chemicals had been dumped into the water. These chemicals are carcinogenic which is more cancer prone when ingested. Such cancers that could have been cause by this drinking water is leukaemia, liver cancer, acute myeloid leukaemia, bladder cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, central nervous system cancer, cervical cancer and more.
