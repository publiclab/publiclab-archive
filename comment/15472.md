[@wmacfarl](/profile/wmacfarl) this is really, really helpful.  

1) we're working on how to document fails this week! We'll keep you posted.  

2) Is there a good example of written/recorded documentation that achieves this that you could point us at? I have to confess i'm really not sure how to do this because it could potentially go in so many different directions (at least with microelectronics, but maybe i should imagine a simpler example...)
