The clean water act was a law passed by the congress in 1972. The clean water act promised to remove toxic substances from water to keep it clean from carcinogens and make all drinking water safe. This law affected the Camp Lejeune case in the favor of the people because this law promised clean water which was passed by the congress or the government which the camp and or military is directly connected to. So, because of this the Camp is easily shown to be unlawful and was bound to fail the case because of the clean water actâ€™s promises.
