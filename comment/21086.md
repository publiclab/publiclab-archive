Whoa, very interesting! 

OK, one thing to consider is that the lens mount is an M12, or very close -- so the lenses you can buy here should fit in the same screw mount: https://store.publiclab.org/collections/diy-infrared-photography

as will many other lenses where removing the filter will be easier. Maybe this will help a bit?
