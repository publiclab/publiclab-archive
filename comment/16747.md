Hi, [@mridulnagpal](/profile/mridulnagpal)! I've looked through your plan in detail and wanted to propose some revisions and a way to break up the work into phases a bit more. I've posted my thoughts over in a new repository named as yours is -- but under the `publiclab` name: 

https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location/issues/1

Some things we'd like to de-prioritize, and others we'd like to do in a different order. Would you mind taking a look and telling me what you think? I hope it makes sense and I'm happy to help flesh it out further.
