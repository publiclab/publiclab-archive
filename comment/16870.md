Wooow!! Great [@warren](/profile/warren)! I'm having some troubles with the orange pi by now. This week we'll lift up a raspberry 2 with both a drone and a ballon. Let's see what happens. Orange pi is awesome. As soon as I got something I'll be back. The main issue by now with the orange one is low camera compatibilities and the one I got is just 2megapixels. Let's see what can we do ;)
