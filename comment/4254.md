Great write-up. Do you have any photos or links to spectra? 

I'm curious about white LEDs, because if we ever make a built-in light source for the mobile spectrometer, it's likely to be an LED. I wonder if it's a broad-spectrum enough source to take good readings. If it's more like the CFLs, it'll have gaps in the spectrum where we won't get any data.
