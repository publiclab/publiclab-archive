Hi [@icarito](/profile/icarito)! What we have done with our ANOIAcam in relation to the battery is to open a regular powerbank and extract the lipo battery inside. Powerbanks usually have a huge lipo battery and a pcb board to control charge. Using a RPI you can plug it directly to the battery using the mini USB or... òpen up the powerbank, extract the lipo (unplug the control board) and using a regular connector (like the adafruit's 6000mah battery) to attach it to the Witty2go. The witty to go can grab energy from a solar panel, recharge the lipo and provide energy to the pi. You could also do it without extracting the lipo and plugging direcly the powerbank to the Witty2go as one of the sources togheter with the solar panel.

Here some 30000 to 50000 mah lipo batteries:
