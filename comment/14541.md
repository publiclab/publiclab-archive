In Spectral Workbench the Y-axis on the spectrogram is "Intensity (%)." If you took the sum of all three channels and plotted them on the same graph, wouldn't it look exactly the same as the average which is plotted now? There is no more information in the sum than in the average. Unless you are capturing and using camera RAW images, the data in the photo files have been through a lot of processing and are a long way from counts of photons. It's just some massaged representation of brightness.
