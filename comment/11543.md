Hi Abaker,  You don't really run the Energia programs.  What you do is load them onto the microcontroller and they will be active for as long as the microcontroller is powered up.  The Energia programs are the instructions for what you want the microcontroller to do when it receives instructions from the GUI.  The different .ino files contain different parts of code that the overall program uses.  The main part of the code is the "Feb_9_2014_Stellaris_DA_Spec.ino" file.  This part of the code has lines that call other parts of the code.  For example, line 62 says: "D_array();" this calls for a bunch of code from the D_array.ino file.
That said, here are some suggestions;  I think that you need to have all the files in a folder called "Feb_9_2014_Stellaris_DA_Spec".  Then open the ino program with that name using Energia.  You should see the main part of the program in one tab and you should have other tabs for the other programs (D_array, etc).  Look for a button with a check mark that will allow you to see if the program compiles.  If it doesn't, read the error message at the bottom of the screen. If you get an error message like "D_array() not defined" it means that the file containing the D_array function did not get into the folder with the Energia code.   
At the top of the Energia window will be a button labeled tools.  Use that one to select the com port your board is attached to, and the type of LaunchPad you are using.  If there are more than one com ports listed, unplug your LaunchPad (or flip the power switch off) and see which one goes away.
There are a few screenshots of Energia programs, along with a little text on getting set up at this site: http://publiclab.org/notes/JSummers/07-04-2014/getting-your-wheestat-set-up
If you have trouble, just post another comment to this site.
Best,
Jack
