Hi KP55,  
I think that the first thing you will need to know is how much data you need to acquire between data retrievals.  That will determine how much memory you will need.  If you need to acquire a point every 10 ms and can't get back to your instrument more than once a month, that will require a lot more memory than if you can acquire every hour and retrieve the data daily.  If your data storage requirement is sufficiently low, then perhaps you can store the data in your Arduino's RAM.  I wrote a sketch a little while back in Energia (very similar to Arduino) that begins logging data when commanded to and continues to log until it either acquires a predetermined maximum, or is given the command to export the data.  In this research note (http://publiclab.org/notes/JSummers/09-23-2014/datalogger-part-2b-simpler-hardware-some-observations-about-ion-selective-electrodes-and-ram) I describe how more than 3000 pairs of integers can be stored in 32 kB RAM that comes with the TI Tiva LaunchPad.    I just put the Energia source code online.  It can be found here: https://github.com/SmokyMountainScientific/EnvDataLogger1.
Hope that helps.
