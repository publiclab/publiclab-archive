[@nedhorning](/profile/nedhorning) thank you so kindly for all of your work, the detail you have put into it has been a tremendous help to me! I have been lucky enough to get my hands on a few small sample spectralon targets which I would like to use to calibrate a raspberry pi based NDVI camera. Since I am using a blue bandpass filter, I am wondering if I need to plot a regression for both the blue channel and the red channel, or just the red channel? Furthermore, I have designed an incident light sensor which will sit on top of my drone to calculate exposure. Do you think there would be a way of measuring illuminance from the sensor, completely bypassing the target calibration process altogether?
