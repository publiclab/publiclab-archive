Thank you [@pablo](/profile/pablo) for the info.

May I know how/what technology that is able to create those 3d maps? 
What I mean, how does a software or hardware is able to turn images from a camera into a 3d map? 
If a camera has gps-location capabilities; it only tracks the location the image it took, and the image is flat. What gives the information of the height and depth of objects in the photo?
