[@Annchy1809](/profile/Annchy1809) there is also a step-by-step guide in youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFOHWaL7XsM&t=797s&list=WL&index=1 -- you can ignore the last part of the video and instead replace the glass filter in the camera with a blue filter: https://store.publiclab.org/collections/diy-infrared-photography/products/infragram-diy-filter-pack - hope this helps!
