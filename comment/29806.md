What a fantastic update! It's great to hear from you [@EdMallon](/profile/EdMallon). An underwater logger running for a year on a single coin cell battery?? COOL. Tagging in [@rebeccaMw](/profile/rebeccaMw) to see this hardware designed to be built and deployed in a remote learning educational context.
