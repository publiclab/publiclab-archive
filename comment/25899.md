These sensors are cheap because they have limited accuracy, they were designed for dish-washers and the like, not technical analysis.  However, I am using them on a project (capturing data to a Raspberry Pi) and they give some good 'ballpark' readings.
The best way is to calibrate them against a good turbidity meter.  I would suggest making up  some control samples and see if you can find an environmental group with a turbidity meter that can measure them for you.  Then use them to calibrate the DB Frost sensors.
I am with a group  that has a turbidity meter, so we did some parallel testing of samples with all the meters for comparison.
