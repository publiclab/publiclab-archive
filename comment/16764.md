I need to look through the archive.org API, but I wonder if it'd be possible to add some of the extra features, or really interfaces, that mapmill tries to provide. I'd been thinking about reworking and debugging mapmill, but the point of its 2.0 was to make it affordable for PL to host so many images. If we could do this via archive.org, that'd be so much better. 

So, I'm thinking:

* map view based on GPS Exif tags
* "Voting" or classification, maybe via the tagging system
* Really smooth and reliable bulk upload (though mapmill never quite got there :-/) with drag and drop
* lots of sorting methods, like sorting by untagged (unranked), by filesize -- these may exist already

Maybe even MapKnitter integration? MapKnitter can place images by GPS and compass and altitude, on a map for a first-pass placement.
