I was really excited to work on this at BarnRaising. As a group we constructed sensors by using tin snips to cut sheets of copper, which is a bit tricky as the snips are sharp. Since I work with copper tape doing circuits, I experimented with using pieces on cardboard. Not only is it fun looking, but it makes a great project for families. My next step is to try using larger copper tape to create a leaf just a bit smaller than someone's hand. I may even scribe some lines for decoration after the sanding. Anyway, the tape still needs to be tested to see if it stands up to weather and if the thickness is okay for sensing. As for waterproofing, perhaps the tape could be applied to pieces of upcycled milk cartons or jugs. Then, the sensor could be placed in an upside-down plastic bottle. That way air can enter without the sensor getting wet. Kind of like a modern ship in a bottle. Here's two pics--one of the sensors we made hanging at Barnraising, and also a close-up of my prototype.
