cool- the spars sound a little thin, I'd keep it only for light wind (sub 10mph), and add some sort of re-enforcement at the ends of the spreader spar, that's the most likely point of failure.  a piece of cloth or other puncture resistant material taped over the end will probably work.

trash bags will definitely work, if there are re-enforcement stripes of tape and a hem--just follow the dazzle delta's diagonal rainbow stripes with some cellophane tape, and tape along all the edges.  Mylar is the preferred material of super-light kite makers though.

plastics are non-porous materials, unlike ripstop, which lets some air through. changing materials will often result in a change in kite behavior because the lift/drag profile is changed.

there's no shame in flying with tail-- it compensates for little errors in construction, making kites way easier to make and flying more stable.  BUT-- if it'll fly without a tail you know you've nailed a truly aerodynamically stable design.
