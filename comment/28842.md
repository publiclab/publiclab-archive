EPA method TO-15 is a common method to test air grab samples for VOCs. There's a little more info about this method and other methods for detecting VOCs and sulfur compounds in the wiki section "[What methods does the lab use to test air samples?](https://publiclab.org/wiki/air-lab-testing#%3Cstrong%3EWhat+methods+does+the+lab+use+to+test+air+samples?%3C/strong%3E)"
