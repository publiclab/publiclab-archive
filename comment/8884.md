Thinking about this a bit further: when determining particle counts, is the  "% low pulse occupancy time" technique relatively insensitive to temperature?  Is the picture I'm supposed to have that regardless of actual air flow, the *relative* amount of time that the IR beam is interrupted by particles would be the same?  Or would it be help to calibrate the device by measuring the temperature inside the air chamber, with e.g. a thermistor?

Aside: if it would help to calibrate the sensor by measuring actual air flow through the device, a 'hot wire anemometer', built using a theristor, might be a neat approach -- there's an open source design for such a device, here:
