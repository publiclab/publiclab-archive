This is a really elegant project!  How do you address the differences in light temperature (RGB) and intensity throughout the day?  I wasn't sure if you would include a separate light sensor to adjust for that or if that's not necessary.  Is there any value in the hourly resolution data as compared to the yearly stuff?  I'm wondering if someone like Planet Labs (https://www.planet.com/) might be able to get daily level satellite data, but they definitely will not get hourly (plus of course that data will always be expensive to access).  

I also wonder if you've considered anything else you could measure if you're going to have a camera set up besides just greenness?  Not sure of ideas, just seems like if you've got the hardware sitting there may as well get the most out of it!
