On your note on phthalates- a question.  Were you talking about bis 2ethyl,hexyl phthalate  (DEHP) or bis n-octylphthalate (DnOP)?  A lot of medical companies have switched to TOTM, which still contains trace levels of DEHP.  How trace depends on the grade of DEHP they bought. As for the analysis,is it going to be based on indicator type sticks?  Or will indicator drops be used, instead?  Please excuse the questions. Been down this road with latex testing for latex allergens.  There were a lot of tests that didn't hold up to medical quality.  Any help is appreciated.
