While it continues to be an evolving prototype, the new Subtraction tools in Spectral Workbench 2.0 (preview) allow for subtraction of one spectrum from another. I'm curious if you might use this to attempt the correction you outline here. I noted a proposed process for a similar subtraction on the mailing lists a couple days ago:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plots-spectrometry/OAXxG40dSyo

* upload an image with two side-by-side cuvettes (hopefully you'll be able to distinguish the two spectra)
* calibrate it (using a calibration from the same setup)
* use the v2.0 interface (see the button along the bottom of the graph to switch into 2.0 preview)
* **clone** the spectrum so you have two copies
* use "set cross section" on each to choose your two different cross-sections of the spectrum, one for each cuvette, pressing "Apply" to accept the new cross-section
* use the "Subtract" tool to subtract one from the other

I'm VERY willing to help out in this process, as it's very much prototype code, and may still be buggy. Eventually, I'd like to use Sreyanth's Procedures code to help guide ppl through this process and automate some parts. 

Please, if someone wants to copy this procedure into a research note and try it out, and post results, that would be GREAT.
