Thanks Patrick, this is good to see. I guess the documentation says to use General because Liz was documenting what worked for her. There are two JST sockets, two switch positions, and USB can be connected or not. Plus a battery can be in General, Lithium, or none (ignore "both" for now). That is 12 (3x2x2) possible combinations of power options. Users will need to know which are to be used for what functions and whether any combinations can break things. That is a big chunk of documentation. 

A Quick Start Guide is a great idea. Then a separate Quick Start Guide to powering the Riffle. Then a Quick Start Guide to connecting your first sensor (that one might be 12 pages long).

The yellow LED at D1 you called the "charging light" I assumed was a "USB power" light. It flickers even when no battery is connected.

Sharing Arduino sketches is going to be an important element of this project. Each sensor will require its own sketch and every combination of sensors will require a new sketch. GitHub is not an option for mortals, but it would be great to have an annotated repository somewhere.
