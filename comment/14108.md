I work with scientific dust monitors and have written and published calibration protocols for them. I have been intrigued by these low cost sensors for a while and was wondering how exactly they work. I was intrigued by your description of the duration of the peak determining the size of the particles. For the instruments I work with the height of the peak is measured to determine the particle size instead. The peaks are approximately Gaussian because the light source is a laser and as the particle enters the dim edge of the beam they generate a low signal compared to when they are in the bright beam centre. I wondered if these low cost sensors cap the signal? This would mean that a bigger particle (which scatters more light) would saturate the signal for more time during its transit through the light source.
