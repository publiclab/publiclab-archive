I did this!

Here's a photo of my microscope in action (without the smartphone, because I needed it to take the photo...). The tiny yellow-ish specks on the plastic slide are grains of flower pollen.

And here's what the pollen grains look like under the microscope! These photos are from my smartphone fitted with the discarded lens. Some of the pollen grains have had their contents smushed out of them, so they appear lighter-colored and more transparent.
