I've just stumbled upon this, so sorry for the delay in responding. cfastie has pretty much nailed some of the difficulties you experienced, that with your own commentary on the difficulty of changing the concentration, which in turn changed the pH, which in turn changes the colour of the indicator. In fact, I can't think of a more difficult way of doing this ! But top marks for bravery and posting the note.

I've done a few of these and can recommend the following technique:

Use a broadband light source, such as a halogen, and don't move it in relation to the spectrometer. That baseline must be absolutely consistent.

From the halogen, pick a wavelength that shows good absorbance, green is a good choice. Using the halogen means you aren't confined to a point wavelength like you are with a CFL. The CFL often produces two green peaks very close and these are extremely sensitive in amplitude. A halogen just gives a smooth curve and lets you pick any convenient wavelength.

As you point out, the "thickness" of the solution that the light is passing through is critical. The cuvettes should work, that is what they are designed for, but they must be placed to completely cover the slit to the spectroscope and placed consistently.

The favourite chemical for this stuff is (green) nickel nitrate. Usually available in labs. It transmits green, so pick a red wavelength to measure the absorbance. Alternatives are food colouring (be careful though, green is actually a mixture of a variety of pigments, so red is again a good choice for the wavelength). Cordial, coffee, in fact anything is better than an indicator that is changing colour as you dilute it ! LoL.

If you are getting strange results looking at the total relative intensity, just pick one colour channel (Red, green or blue) and use the output from that sensor, at the desired wavelength. 

Good luck, I'm going to follow in your footsteps and do a side by side comparison of a commercial spectroscope (used as a spectrophotometer) and my version of the PLOTS design, using plastic cuvettes, nickel nitrate and green food colouring.

thanks again for taking the time to post your research note. Unlike cfastie though, I couldn't find the spectra you obtained. Can you point me towards them please ?
