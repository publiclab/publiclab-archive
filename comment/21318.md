OK, also just a note, i had trouble w the placement of the orange wire, which in Leslie's diagram goes to a spot one pin higher than in my version. Mine is a red wire and basically my circuit swapped the two circled wire endings in order to work.

I think it's almost identical because the top two rows could almost be swapped to counteract my change, but i need to test it to be sure.
