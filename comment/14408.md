[@viechdokter](/profile/viechdokter), perhaps even here, terminology can be problematic. Example: 'Ranking'. There really are many interpretations and implications of the word. So, I'm going to suggest that the process behind the term define the term. In this case, I'd suggest the process is primarily to "sort" documents which meet PLab requirements such as on-topic, clear, supportable, complete, factual, etc. Yes, some note may be much more professional than other notes, but that range of presentation can all still be "accepted" under the umbrella of a thoughtful scientific process. In parallel, when a note has value but is missing description (for example) then the feedback to the author should be suggestions for what to 'fill-in' to make the work both more usable, of greater value and meet PLab's goals. As I see it, PLab is dedicated to open and availability of science but that does not mean they cannot or should not maintain standards. I agree, "ranking" of art is a silly concept -- but here we're discussing quality of science.

One possible result of this process is the creation of a "charter" of how this 'filter' is to function and what the goals are. If that is open and transparent, and most agree it fits PLab's own charter, then the process may provide real value.
