Okay, you and I want the same thing, for different reasons.  I am looking for pure aluminium holographic foil, which is definitely being produced, but I am not sure of the quality.  On the other hand, you can get away with Pet, holographic film, which is almost as cheap as wrapping paper, and the quality is remarkably good.  How good it is, compared to a commercial grating, is unkown, but certainly better than using a DVD...
