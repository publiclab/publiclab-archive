Awesome! I just ordered my kit and feel like a kid waiting for Santa. I was resigned to buying an Ocean Optics unit for 50x the price when this one will be 50x more fun and will probably do what I want and more, while giving me a chance to help others. My goal is far off, but this is basically it: http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/36189/InTech-Optical_technologies_for_determination_of_pesticide_residue.pdf

I see several people mention that the led is a problem and they cover it. There is always the possibility light will leak. Just take it off the board. If you can't unsolder it snip it off, or the current limit resistor. It won't change anything about the camera function.
