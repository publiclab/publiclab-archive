Hi chmooze,
To identify trees in Winter is kind of advanced; when you are in a City, even more; but I would like to motivate you to have a look on the trees anyway. This could help you next Winter!! :) I'm from Berlin/Potsdam, too, and of course there are some experts you could contact; but I would offer you the use of an OpenSource Project (outsourced of an old EU-Project) I like pretty much! People from the Naturkundemuseum Berlin are actually working together with lots of experts and user; step by step to offer an online and open identification key for all species you can find in Germany (later other countries like Italy etc.). I would say especially for trees the Key is quite good and can give you even more links to other literature. I think this would be the best way to help your self. If you still have some questions feel free to contact me.
best
Bjorn
