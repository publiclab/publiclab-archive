Hmm. So I'm wondering if part of the fit problem is because we're simply comparing intensity at the 14 points and 13 troughs. Take this example:

Though I equalize the max heights of the two before running RMSE, I bet the baseline variation makes the match not great. I could try *not* measuring troughs? But that doesn't seem right.

Or, we could "search around" each of the 14 expected peaks for where peaks actually occur, find their exact real locations, and add up the error for each peak. This could fail if not every peak is found, but we could narrow it to fewer, more prominent peaks. 

I may simply have made some dumb mistakes in implementing RMSE, but if the approach has more fundamental flaws, maybe this is an alternative.
