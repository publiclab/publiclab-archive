Thanks a lot for your advice, sorry for my late reply. 
Since I regard myself as spectrometry-newbie reading the comments felt a bit like “biting off more than one can chew”, however the plan is complete / ready now: At first I'll learn about that colorimetric reagents  (which I hadn't in mind before, thinking measuring mere  reflection-effects  would work as well). Secondly I'll probably learn about Beer's law or similar concentration measurement principles. (The nutritients I'm interested in measuring at the moment are in particular:  Nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus but in the long run I'm eager to see which other nutritients can be spectrometrically measured).  
Of course I'll also have a detailed look at the elaborate ready to use devices  that  were mentioned above for they seem to be a good alternative.
Thanks again for sharing your knowledge and thus jump-starting my hobby-project.
