 Oh wow, thank you so much for the ideas and support. We would definitely follow the best approach in building the library and get in touch with [@rexagod](/profile/rexagod) and [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) for their suggestions on the same. I agree with you in moving the integration parts a little late in the timeline, that way we will be surer of what is that we want from plots2 and build a skeletal but functional system for starters. Thank you so much for offering us a sensor and we will definitely email you when we want to try it out, I have an Arduino kit at home anyways! Thanks a ton again!
