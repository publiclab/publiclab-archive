Hmmm, well the RAW data should have the same scale units which would be unsigned 8-bit integer from 000 to 255 -- so the Y axis should show noise having it's smallest vertical increment shown on the Yaxis scale as a unit of '1' -- so for a scale Y inc of 10, you should be able to see 10 steps of the smallest quantization of noise.

As for the CSV files from SWB, if it's raw data, it should not have interpolated values .... but, with that said, SWB does do some "scaling" and so, unfortunately, it can be very unclear if the CSV data someone exports has been scaled. (They also scale the X axis after CFL calibration which is the source of the "higher-precision" wavelength data which can be misleading as well). Assuming the '2.55' values are from a scaled plot, then they could make sense -- i.e. 2.55 is thus the scale factor which represents an 8-bit '1' value. (This does look to be the case as the next value up should be and 8-bit '2' which is 5.1 scaled ... which does appear in the list.) So, if you're dealing with SWB scaled data, you could 're-scale' that data back to 'raw' and then plot -- the y-axis should show 1 unit per noise quantization minimal value of 1.
