I am the kits fulfillment coordinator at PL, I don't have very much (any, really) scientific background but I do have a background in economics/business. My opinion should be taken lightly, but [@dhaffnersr](/profile/dhaffnersr) if youre hoping to find a low cost method but still want it to be accurate then I think you can choose either an LED or a laser, 405 nm lasers seem to be selling (and I don't know if they're the right ones) at between $10 and $50 (I'm sure they go up from there but those are the common market prices); and while that would make the user purchase price of the desktop spectrometer double, it would still only double to $100. For accurate, reproducible data I'm very, very, very confident that the PL spectrometer would be as popular or more popular than it currently is. I base this confidence off of the average ticket price of the other kits at the PL store, the volume of DSK 3.0's sold, and the expectations of our customers as derived from our brand image.

So feel free to use either source, whatever works. Don't let the cost be a determining factor in the search for good data if the laser might make your quest easier.
