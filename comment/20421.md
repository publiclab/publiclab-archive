Thanks :) Some bumps here as I learn the quirks of the platform... So I just did delete a couple of the comments to clean up this thread. 

One of those now deleted comments though had the following line in there, which I'll just restate here. After I added the questions:lead and notes:lead tags, I saw the questions appear on top of the page. I actually didn't like the presentation / location; it makes it harder to find the wiki itself and distracts the reader. So I removed those tags. I added a link to the top-line lead wiki at the bottom instead.

(I found the github repo where site issues can be posted. I hesitate to just jump into that stream blindly, but I'm checking it out now to get a sense as to what's going on there.)
