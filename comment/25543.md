I suppose to get agencies to respond. Often photos are not enough for TSS, but are for oil. If we only have one staff person for thousands of facilities, there's competition for attention. in this case, Hilcorp after Barry, we needed to be out there to photograph a sheen and email it in.  it would be better if we could make the company report on itself with a transparent sensor. 

Hilcorp, NRC reports 125 3034 and 125 3044
