Hi [@divyabaid16](/profile/divyabaid16) ! Thanks so much!!! ðŸŽ‰

I'm sorry to be repetitive, but I do think you may find a lot of helpful notes in the other proposals where I left comments yesterday: (all listed here: https://publiclab.org/notes/gauravano/03-12-2019/call-for-outreachy-2019-proposals)

One note in particular is that I've recommended Questions be moved earlier and Profiles a bit later in the timeline. 

I really appreciate that you've made changes/tweaks/additions to the mockups!  

One thing everyone might consider [@IshaGupta18](/profile/IshaGupta18) [@lekhidugtal](/profile/lekhidugtal) [@madeofhuman](/profile/madeofhuman) is the process of posting a new "shadow" interface that one can access by going to, for example `/dashboard2` instead of `/dashboard` -- allowing us to present the new designs to a limited audience first for feedback using https://Lookback.io. Perhaps it's good to factor this feedback process into the planning? 

Thank you!
