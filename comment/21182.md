As a system, the balloon and kite parts are definitely lifting more than dragging-- Airpup climbs to higher angles as the wind goes from 3 to12mph and the pull is fairly light, much less than I would expect from a spherical balloon of a similar size.

From those winds on up the pull starts to really take off.  I'm not sure which part is pulling the most.

One of the goals of the keels is to direct air into the low-pressure zone behind the balloon and increase air attachment on the back side. This is highly speculative though-- I have no proof this is what's happening, and need to do string and flow tests to verify.
