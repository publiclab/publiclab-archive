[@stevie](/profile/stevie) [@cherokeeconcernedcitizens](/profile/cherokeeconcernedcitizens). What kind of support are you looking for?

I would like to build skills at reading permitting documentation and have roughly two weeks available.  I could spend a day going through this document if you wanted to share it and do a quick phone call about what specifically you are looking to pull out.
