Blender looks to be quite capable. I have some questions about your 3 step process to make the color mapped image:

- What is the "A" in RGBA?
- You said you applied the color map to the image, but did you also compute NDVI for each pixel? Or apply a color map to the original photo?
- Does the blending in the third step explain why the color in the sky is not a color in the color gradient you used?

There seems to be great potential here.
