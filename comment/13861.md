Hi, Franky - great to read your proposal and I've added it as a response to this page: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/03-10-2016/google-summer-of-code-2016-draft-proposals

If you could go in and `**bold**` your headings, or use `### Markdown headings` for readability (see [formatting tips](https://publiclab.org/wiki/authoring-help#Formatting)), that'd be great. I cleaned up [the template page](/wiki/gsoc-application-template) in case that helps your formatting.

Also, best keep "through enhancing searching and sorting" in the title or it may sound too vague at first glance.

It sounds like you're referencing work from the Rich Profiles, Q&A, and Search and sorting ideas. This is all right, but if other students apply with more of a focus on one of those, you may want to narrow your scope and build out ideas in more detail that are focused on just one of those three. Your work plan indicates an initial project in profile tagging, so maybe that'd be the one? Anyhow, we'll have to see what other students post. 

+1 for your responses on working with non-technical users and your interest in environmental justice. 

Thanks, this is looking good!
