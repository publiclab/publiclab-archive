That's some excellent detective work. We know there is mercury in all fluorescent lamps, so all the big mercury peaks should be present in all good spectra of fluorescent lamps. If the 542-543 nm peak is missing in your spectrum of a long fluorescent tube, then that peak is probably not a mercury emission peak. That suggests the missing peak is terbium, just like the Wikipedia article says it is. Without really careful calibration, you can't know for sure which of the two green lines is missing, but the brighter peak at 546 nm is a well documented mercury peak. So we can assume that the single peak is the 546 nm mercury peak, and the peak at 542-543 nm in most CFL lamps is not mercury. It's still puzzling why there is such poor information about the wavelength and source of that bright green peak at 542-543 nm in all CFL lamps. 

I looked at a few of the cleaner CFL spectra at Spectral Workbench and the two big green peaks are always farther apart than the two green peaks in the reference spectrum displayed during calibration. That suggests that the reference spectrum being used is the one I corrected based on the Wikipedia information that the "terbium" peak was at 543 to 544 nm. It seems that CFLs actually have a peak closer to 542 nm, so the clean spectra at Spectral Workbench that show two peaks show them farther apart than in the reference spectrum. It might make sense to use another spectrum for the reference. This is one corrected for all the Wikipedia peaks but with the "terbium" peak at 542.5 nm: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/show2/58696.

Making that change will not matter to most users because there appear to be very few CFL spectra in which those two peaks can be discerned. But with the current reference spectrum, the best CFL spectra will never match all the major peaks in the reference.
