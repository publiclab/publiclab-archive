Michael, Take a look at this comparison study of different microscopes: https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/08-19-2019/microscope-calibration-with-image-sequencer

-To achieve full resolution with the picamera you need to adjust camera format  settings, this will result in > 5Mb file size.    

-Did not measure working distance but it was very very close, almost on top of the objective.  
- High magnifications adjustments are also difficult.
