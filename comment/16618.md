It seems that it might be straightforward to store arrays of data in the 32k of flash memory in a 328p chip. Flash memory is non-volatile and your data will persist if the device is powered down. The keyword [PROGMEM](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PROGMEM) will write data to flash memory. I don't know how one would retrieve the data, but a sketch can read the data from flash. So  your sketch could include code in the startup loop that read all the data from flash (one array element at a time?) and wrote it via serial (e.g., USB). So when you are finished logging data, connect via serial to a computer and the first thing that happens when the device is powered on is that all the data in flash memory is printed to the serial monitor.

Clock crystals which improve the precision of the arduino's millisecond counter [cost five cents apiece](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=aduino+clock+crystal&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xarduino+crystal.TRS0&_nkw=arduino+crystal&_sacat=0), so that could be a worthwhile addition to a $2.00 Pro Mini data logger.

So this concept is for a single Arduino Pro Mini with a little crystal soldered to it, period. Cost so far $2.05. Connect batteries and sensors to it and it logs data for a long time.

But the Pro Mini could be put to sleep between logging events. This requires a real time clock ([$1.00](http://www.ebay.com/itm/DS3231-Precision-RTC-Module-Memory-Module-for-Arduino-Raspberry-Pi-DIY-D-/112049307161?hash=item1a16a8be19:g:PYkAAOSwYIxX436N)) with alarms to wake it up for the next logging. I don't know whether this is worthwhile because there is no uart chip or SD card to waste current, so there might be nothing to put to sleep. 

If I had any real understanding of these things this would be a fun project to try.
