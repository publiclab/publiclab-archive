When the NIR cut filter is removed from a camera, all three color channels capture NIR light in addition to the color they originally captured (R, G, or B). So NIR is mixed with visible light in all channels in unknown proportions.

Adding certain colored filters can allow one of the color channels to capture only NIR light and another to capture mostly visible light.
