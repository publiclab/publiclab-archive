Marcelo, I thought Kanarinka was brave to put her Sony Nex 5N on a pole, but threatening to put a new US$750 Sony RX100 II on a balloon goes beyond courage.

The RX100 II has the same features as the Nex 5N, so you can try the "Continuous shooting" hack described above. Let us know if it doesn't work so I can stop recommending it. 

The RX100 also has two other features:

- WiFi: the range of the built in WiFi would limit the camera height, and I doubt it could be used to trigger the camera, although you might be able to use it to look at the photos being taken.
- NFC: [Near Field Communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Near_Field_Communication_simple-explantion_EN.webm) can apparently be used to trigger the camera from an adjacent smart phone. So if you fly a phone with the camera, an app on the phone could send signals to the camera to shoot. And maybe also to change focus, zoom, ISO, switch to video, etc. Also, the photos can be transferred to the phone and emailed to your other phone in real time or you could stream live video of what the phone was seeing. 

With this setup you could be the envy of the balloon mapping community.
