Going to have to wait a day or so before can do more, as I managed to short out the IR sensor while transferring things over to a small circuit board.

D'oh!!

And I have now found the diagram software you are using to make the nice circuit diagrams, so will shortly be able to do a bit better than the simple hack job of did of Jeff's original circuit.
