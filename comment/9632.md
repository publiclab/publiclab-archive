Check out my recent research note- http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/07-25-2014/grassroots-underwater-photography
I've been using floating camera platforms with the camera facing downward with decent results.  I'm interested in testing it with various LED/sensor combinations but I don't want to do anything without significant input from others who know more than I do regarding light and water...  Which would include just about everybody in that case...
