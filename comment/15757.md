Hi [@wward1400](/profile/wward1400) , I love this idea of seeing projects together! As a step toward that, Stevie and Sara are working on making project pages themselves better, check out https://publiclab.org/wiki/mapping-the-waste-stream-of-southern-california -- it's got sections for Who's Involved and How to Get Involved, Next Steps, Updates, Activities that are part of this project, Data, Questions, and general resources. 

Tagging up a bunch of projects to display them in a grid would be great, but many project pages are wikis which won't show up in the grids. The Geography project on Public Lab didn't quite get completed over the summer, although all the backend work is apparently ready to go -- there's a long term vision that PL would get to a map-based display so we can see what projects are happening where, along with what questions are being asked of where, and what data has been collected where.
