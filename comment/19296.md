Decided to make a custom QGIS profile.

Thank you all for the very valuable info. Ok so here's the result of my research:

- [uMap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/new/#8/8.725/-80.173) has a beautiful, modern user interface, the kind of thing we would ideally use. However it can't handle shapefile layers! So we can't use it. Also: needs to be online, forgot to say we need something that runs offline, like [Mapeo](https://www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo/), as we will be working in remote forest communities.

- The "[13 Free GIS Software Options](https://gisgeography.com/free-gis-software/)" article is an excellent source. I tested everything that runs on Linux and they basically all had the old fashioned GUI similar to the QGIS one, with a couple of exceptions.

- [GeoDa](http://geodacenter.github.io/) is a very interesting option, but can only display one layer at a time.

- [Whitebox GAT](http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/Whitebox/index.html) has an interesting UI, but not revolutionary enough in my mind to justify moving from QGIS

- So I've gone for the recommendation cited by alyd_vt: to use [QGIS' built-in UI customization tool](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/qgis_configuration.html#customization) and basically get rid of all menu options, toolbars and buttons that we won't be using for our introductory course and mapmaking work. I'm actually surprised I can't find any pre made QGIS .ini customisation files on the internet.

There seems to me to be a big unmet need for a general-purpose GIS with an UI more like OSM's iD and uMap. Maybe it can be done using a preexisting back end. Anyways, stay tuned for my custom QGIS 2.18 .ini file and the results of our field testing!
