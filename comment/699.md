I just noticed that MS ICE will save files as PNG and also as Photoshop.  When saved as Photoshop, the background is transparent. So it is easy to get rid of the black background.  

The stitched image can also be saved as a Deep Zoom tileset.

Also the three planar modes of stitching are 1) Rigid Scale, 2) Affine, and 3) Homography.

The most serious problem with making maps with ICE is that the stitched result is not georectified and may require extensive rubbersheeting to align with a basemap.  Maybe one of the planar modes will be better than others for reducing this problem.
