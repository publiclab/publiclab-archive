Off to great start. [@tonchuks](/profile/tonchuks) .
Your comment made me curious , so here I am  ðŸ˜ƒ   
Maybe you used different username in Github ðŸ¤” 

Walking into main topic, I liked everything being specified into points.  
Especially, all the work is divided along the timeline.

[@warren](/profile/warren) suggested in the proposal regarding the addition of search page. Maybe you can look into it. 
ðŸ¤”   
 There is another additional design for another section of dashboard in one of the comments of one of the notes. You can look into that.
It would be great to have those features added into your proposal.
