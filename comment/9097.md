the 555 is pretty simple.  There's not [that much inside of it](http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/tinykitlist/652).  If it simplifies the power circuitry issues you're facing then go with it.  I hadn't thought about the oscillations being important either, but I don't see how that solves the polarization issue-- the signal coming out will oscillate, but you're taking DC in.

I guess I'm wondering why the electrodes have to be 2cm apart, also remember that you're not measuring impedance of the water, you're measuring it in series.  By playing with the other side of the voltage divider you could probably adjust for this issue. 

I'd go for the capacitor method.  I think the power consistency issues you're facing will be almost identical with the 555.
