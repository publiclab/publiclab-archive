Safety first.  The problems you describe could be caused by a furnace not working correctly and generating carbon monoxide.  Please get a carbon monoxide detector, if you don't already have one, and get your furnace checked.

Environmental tests are very expensive.  It's better to eliminate any tests that have already been done or are unlikely.  For example, was a radon test done when you bought the property?  If so, unless there is overwhelming reason, don't repeat the test.  Was a lead paint test done (lead paint wasoutlawed in residences in 1978, so it could have been used in your house)? Unfortunately, that will probably take getting an M.D. Involved to tell you what environmental factors could cause the physical problems.
