There might be some math magic that will help, but that is beyond me. It will be important to check that whatever math is done, the resulting index does not just highlight the high reflection of NIR from foliage. Any IR image will make leaves look bright, but that effect has limited ability to reveal plant health for the reasons discussed here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plots-infrared/OJXWI2geBfw. 

In your set (IR+R, IR+G, and IR+B), IR is probably different in each channel, so there are really six variables, and you don't know what any of them are. Good luck.
