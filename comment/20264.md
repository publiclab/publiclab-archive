Oh hi [@rgardaphe](/profile/rgardaphe) - sorry, missed your comment! Is there a plan for hosted or web-based QRI options? We are looking for ways to enable folks to upload data without having to run their own server -- for example folks collecting sensor data who aren't programmers -- as easily as possible, and for that to be archived. I understand the interest in decentralized storage, but is there a use case where people would be able to find an accessible home for community-collected sensor data?
