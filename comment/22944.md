My thought, as a recent newcomer who was unfamiliar with Public Lab and Citizen Science, is that the How to Participate section in particular is what I was looking for before I started wondering about specific topics. With that in mind perhaps consider moving the How to Participate section up a notch... Also wondering what's going to happen with the Interests section...Just a few curated highlights, something more dynamic, a launchpad into a easy to browse index?  Bottom line is I love that you're sketching this out... Could make a huge difference in engaging newcomers. I like it!!
