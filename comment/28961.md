[@denissebn_06](/profile/denissebn_06) - Kriging is a type of spatial interpolation that can estimate values for unknown locations based on known values/locations.

This is a [good blog post](https://www.azavea.com/blog/2016/09/12/kriging-spatial-interpolation-desktop-gis/) on kriging from one of the previous Summer of Maps fellows at Azavea explaining it and different applications that can be used to perform the different types of kriging.
