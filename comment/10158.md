Hey Greg,

Wow, this is amazing!  Super cool to see you forging ahead with this.  My impression is that what's going on here is that the basic utility of the 'riffle' is to do with the RTC + the microSD -- that is, a design that's intended to be an easy-to-use, low-power datalogger. And then we're adding additional sensors to turn it into a water quality datalogger, an air quality datalogger, a plant health datalogger, etc ... is that how you're thinking about it?  Cool things to think about!

Anyhoo, I'm wondering if the problem you're running into is resulting simply from my poor documentation :)  I haven't consolidated everything I should, but as a first shot:  if you look at the 'Required Libraries' section here:

https://github.com/walkerjeffd/riffle-ito-apps/

are you using the same libraries? Maybe that's the issue? Lemme know ...
