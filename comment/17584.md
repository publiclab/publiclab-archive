Ah! That was an oversight, that there was no "check all that apply" -- do you think we should add to what's there or instead remove "multi-ethnic" in favor of this improvement?

The Community Survey did *not* say how the data would be used -- i believe that was an oversight. It was anonymous unless someone offered their contact information. Glad you will be including language around this and the All Community Survey will do so in the future.
