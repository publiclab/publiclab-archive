[@Ecta64](/profile/Ecta64) How do you feel about the Kite Anemometer section and lift calculations?   I really think a lookup chart of "I have X grams of stuff I need Y kite in Z wind to lift it" would be real helpful.   You don't need to be able to answer the question, but do you think you could frame it given some of the articles on kite anemometry?
