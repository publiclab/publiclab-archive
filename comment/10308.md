Hi MaikB85. Sorry for the late reply. I wired the TSL146RS CCD exactly how they suggest in the data sheet for serial operation. This requires a power, ground, two digital write, and one analog read pin. I believe the wiring diagram is on page 9 of the data sheet. If you need more info. then that just let me know.
