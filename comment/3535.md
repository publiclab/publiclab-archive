Hi Chris,
Two comments.
1) You might be overestimating Ebert's rigidity, so try deliberately stressing it to see how much change you get in the CFL spectrum.  Also try removing and re-mounting the camera a few times.  There could also be some geometry changes related to temperature changes.

2) Accurately measuring relative intensities of spectral lines could present a problem because of the rgb pixelation and the camera's attempt to make the scene look like what the human eye would see.  Try comparing the spectrum of a black-body radiator like a tungsten light to the calculated  black-body curve and you will likely see this effect.  An Excel black body calculator can be found here:
