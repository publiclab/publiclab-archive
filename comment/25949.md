Hi! I've noticed that the Pi runs /much/ faster when adequately cooled -- strange but true, because I think it throttles to reduce temperature. 

So, if you can add a heat sink, or otherwise cool it, it'll actually run faster.

Are you seeing the video framerate being slow, or just the webpage loading itself? Could it be WiFi related or is it definitely the processor speed? And, is it slow on the client device (where you're watching it) or on the Pi?

I've recently seen some slowness too, which is strange because we have not modified the software at all, so I wonder what is going on. But thanks for helping to troubleshoot. 

One more thing - if it's framerate slowness, is this true both in the Infragram app and the basic camera app?

Thanks!
