Hello [@stace](/profile/stace) - thank you so much for your proposal! I do want to note that we have a pretty well-developed design already and that we are aiming to stick to it for the big changes -- however your input and design thinking skills are very welcome on specifics that aren't covered by our mockups! You can see the mockups in, for example, the proposal by [@ruthnwaiganjo](/profile/ruthnwaiganjo) - https://publiclab.org/notes/ruthnwaiganjo/10-26-2020/outreachy-winter-proposal-new-dashboard-implementation-project

My apologies if this was unclear in our proposal posting. I like your ideas a lot and hope you'll find ways to put your creative thinking to work on the unresolved portions of the design! Also please see the style guide posting at https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/05-07-2019/introducing-a-draft-style-guide-for-public-lab for more on specific styling conventions we're planning to stick to. Thank you again!
