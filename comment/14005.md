Hey Jeff, I figured out what was wrong, I redesigned the cuvette holder and shot the laser through at a perpendicular angle here is a set I did with a green laser and here is a plot using a 405nm UV laser and clearly demonstrates fluorescence, I haven't processed it yet because I am still working out some kinks.
