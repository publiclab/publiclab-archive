Hi Chris,

I just had a look at the "ideal spectra" above. The ones with the 100% straight lines. Made me think about how light is created in the light source. Usually, natural radiation (from the stars for instance) is a kind of black body radiation. Something is "heated up", it's electrons get raised to a higher band and when they fall down they emit radiation. The highest peak of this radiation is related to the temperature of the black body. Here is a spectrum of our sun. (public domain)

The only way to get a straight curve (not necessarily 100%) would be to add loads of different curves from different sources with different temperatures. Something like that (just a crude drawing, don't mind the colours, they are just to distinguish between curves):

Should be interesting to think about how to construct such a light source physically. Anyone keen on a Nobel Prize???

(One way could be to use only one single curve and "shift" it constantly towards red or blue...)
