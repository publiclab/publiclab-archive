That's pretty neat. How airflow will be controlled, as I would expect a moving vehicle to increase particulate measurements as a matter of the airflow change.  

I think collecting data on travel speed to control for any effects is important. In Apte's research he used impellers to control airflow. I know [@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) has some low-cost impeller suggestions.
