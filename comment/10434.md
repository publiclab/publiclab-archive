Hi there, I'm yet another pirateship person.  Don pointed this thread out about rendering research notes from flatfiles maybe on github.  I'm very excited!  I'm working on similar rendering of markup to html and I thought I might mention some things I'd come across.

I have a book on github, [The Rime of the Ancient Mariner](https://github.com/sethwoodworth/The-Rime-of-the-Ancient-Mariner_151).  This was a Project Gutenberg book, so there was a text file with the entire text of _Rime_.  I converted the file to [asciidoc](http://asciidoctor.org/) (very-similar-to markdown).  You'll notice that when you view the [book's markup file on github](https://github.com/sethwoodworth/The-Rime-of-the-Ancient-Mariner_151/blob/gh-pages/151.adoc) that it is automatically rendered to html by github.

I rendered _Rime's_ markup file into html on my computer, and pushed to a github branch named `gh-pages`.  This turned on github pages and [renders the html file at this url](sethwoodworth.github.io/The-Rime-of-the-Ancient-Mariner_151/151.html).

Extending the plots2 repo (that runs this site) to poll github for updates and render a page (with caching) shouldn't be too hard.  I'd be happy to lend a hand.
