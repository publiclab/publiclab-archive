[@Artichoke23](/profile/Artichoke23) - What I have seen in testing is that a red filter will give you much greater contrast and sensitivity in crop vigor. A good example is corn. Stressed corn leaves will continue to absorb blue while reflecting much more red than healthy leaves. Ned Horning has a good note showing why red filters should work well with NDVI(https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/11-01-2013/why-a-red-filter-should-work-well-for-ndvi) I'm not certain on the cost of specific filters but MidOpt can do custom stuff too(http://midopt.com/filters/db660850/)
The 40% is what worked for specific settings on that Canon camera. I confirmed the NDVI of specific trees then adjusted the formula until I got the same value. The percentage of NIR in the blue channel to subtract from the red goes up dramatically if the images are not calibrated with reflectance targets.
