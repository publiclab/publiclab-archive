Thank you [@warren](/profile/warren) for this great project!

I am planning to use its basics to build a similar spectrometer and I want to ask you a few questions:

1. What type of diffraction grating I should choose for best results - 500, 530 or 1000 lines/mm?

2. The diffraction grating I can get will be only 35x24mm. Does it mean that the inside width of the "dark chamber" should be 35 mm as well?

3. Important question about the angle of diffraction grating positioned relative to bottom side in your model. Can you explain angle you choose and give some advice for right geometry of my own device?

Will appreciate your answers very much.
