I think the algorithm to convert a blue- or red-filtered NIR photo to color NDVI is something like this:

1. Start with a color photo in which one channel has captured NIR light and another has captured visible light.
2. Compute NDVI for each pixel.
3. Scale NDVI in each pixel (which ranges from -1.0 to +1.0) so instead it ranges from 0 to 255.
4. You now have a grayscale image (one color channel only) with brightness related to NDVI.
5. Produce a new image in which the NDVI value in each pixel is converted to a three channel color using a look up table.
6. You now have a color image in which color encodes values for NDVI.

The look up table used for the [Fastie colormap is here]( https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/146/original/NDVI_VGYRM-lut.txt).
This might not be the exact table used at infragram.org but it is the one used by that Fastie fellow.
