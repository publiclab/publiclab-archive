One of my high school teacher friends mentioned that he wanted add Arduino based projects to his science classroom, but after I posted those DIY guides he suggested that my logger build plans still had too much detail (and soldering...) for him to tackle with a class full of high school students. So I cobbled together a simpler Uno-based version that can be jumpered together quickly with a breadboard:

The code posted with the logger captures the temp register from the DS3231 RTC, which has low 0.25C resolution but has actually proven to be pretty accurate compared to other dedicated temp sensors. Hopefully that starter script is simple enough that people don't have too much trouble modifying it for the sensors they want to add.
