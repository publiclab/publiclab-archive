This is an AWESOME article, and it's just a perfect compilation of all the work you've done. I really like how you put it in a story and then also highlighted the broader PRs -- we can surely reference them for future. 

Kudos to all the learnings, milestones you've achievements and fantastic work done during the GSoC.
