The New York Sea Grant program put together a fabulous guide called "Environmental Justice Mapping Tools for New York State Communities," [available here](https://seagrant.sunysb.edu/articles/t/resources-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-dei-resources). The PDF guide contains a similar table of online mapping tools that notes whether the tool includes environmental data, facilities data, and an environmental justice component (among other data categories).

Thanks [@amocorro](/profile/amocorro) for the heads up!
