Hey, I enjoyed LeafFest and decided to share my thoughts on the experience (besides the pretty pics and projects from the blog post). This is more like how was the event and what can we hack for next time round.  I'm sure most of these you've heard/done before, so no harm/no foul::)

*Awesome Things*

Hiking and learning about shrooms-maybe next time we can actually connect the walk with current PublicLab projects to give the walk even more meaning

Making connections with people that are rock stars in my science tech world (And some people have extended family in that realm that we really ought to blog about ahem...[@CFastie](/profile/CFastie))

The demos of the projects including the kite, webjack, Gephi software, streamCam

Having people like Wilda and Molly present who aren't directly PublicLab people. In innovation we would call them "stretchers" as they help create balance between the known and unknown.

Fresh food by Chris - he was a great sport about feeding all of us


*Things to Hack* 

Still better to have an unconference format or something more formalized so stuff can really get done. Yeah including rock exercises--that should be a thing!

For bad WiFi connection, best to have breakouts so people can do some work while others do a demo or talk session to free up signal. 

Add a "helpful hints overview": conduct--respectful space (people and ideas respected), each person responsible for cleaning up for themselves, people volunteer at each meal to cook/clean

More central location (is there a State Park or KOA that has WiFi?? teehee!)

Maybe have an end goal or something each person commits to during the weekend (like mine would be a blog post or activity write-up)

Thanks for listening and hoping that other people both seasoned and new will share their ideas here. Thanks for a good intro to PublicLab from someone that has been lurking for quite some time.
