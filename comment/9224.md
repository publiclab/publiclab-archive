Hi, Mercy - i want to emphasize that our major objective is to have GPS exif tags in the images, as that will integrate with Vidun's project. It would be great if you could focus on that portion of the project first, and release a working version. Then an extra feature addressing the photo emailing would be an excellent follow-up. Thanks and sorry for the slow feedback!
