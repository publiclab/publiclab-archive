What is described above is hardware development approached as current day software development. You have a main trunk (project lead) which is forked by different people and depending on the state of the fork and the desired integration forks are merged into the main trunk again.

This is a very good idea. However, I encourage people to leave people enough room to have different opinions. I would consider it a good thing that not everything gets merged.
