Since this is late, file a complaint:
https://internet.deq.louisiana.gov/portal/ONLINESERVICES/FORMS/FILE-A-CITIZEN-COMPLAINT  

if an ongoing emergency, call LSP, not LDEQ. 
 Louisiana State Police (LSP) Hazardous Material Hotline at (225) 925-6595  

LDEQ  1 888 763 5424

If they would like our national partners to be informed, it's good to file an NRC report, I can help with that.
US Coast Guard  1 800 424 8802

To report video files, after you have called,
 email  spoc@la.gov 
1) with an incident or complaint number, 
2) date, your name, and suspected responsible party  

Requirements for Emergency Notification: (LAC 33:I.3915)
For Emergency incidents, as defined in (LAC 33:I.3915), call the Louisiana State Police (LSP) Hazardous Material Hotline at (225) 925-6595 as soon as possible within the first hour of the emergency.  A call to the LDEQ does not qualify as Emergency incident notification. However, a written notification report by the facility to the LDEQ is still required within seven calendar days after the initial reporting to the Louisiana State Police.
