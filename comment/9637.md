Now I'm really curious to try this with Infragram!  Warren- Am I correct in guessing that the Infrablue pack of IR filters will not work with the Mobius and that a Red filter is required instead?  If so, is there a particular filter that is recommended?  It doesn't look like the filter replacement process is exactly easy, but this is another reason why the removable lens modules are such a huge advantage since they only cost $30 each.  Also, have the Infragram modifications been tested with the wide-angle lens or just with the standard?
