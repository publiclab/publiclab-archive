Hi Don, looks great procedure, and while not knowing if it actually works - it does give a procedure for establishing a range for a specific set of sensors.

My comment on your procedure is it might be easier/more accurate adding water then figuring out how to drain it, but  thats perhaps a refinement for who ever gets to use.
