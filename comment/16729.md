Hi, all - just checking that everyone's followed the link above to subscribe -- One thing I wanted to ask everyone to do as well is to read over this article:

https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-31-2016/create-a-welcoming-first-timers-only-issue-to-invite-new-software-contributors

We're going to be doing things "more socially" this summer -- really asking each student to reach out and engage with new contributors through their work. Think about how you might be able to find smaller projects in your work that could invite others in!
