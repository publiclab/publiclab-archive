I like the smartphone idea, and I like the multiple people idea. If 5 or 6 people take smartphone photos of the site, the camera installation, landmarks, and each other, and then immediately upload the photos to some social photo-sharing site (Instagram, Flickr, Twitter, whatever), there will be multiple time and GPS stamps with photographic evidence of the camera installation and all the people. That would be very hard to fake, and changing GPS or timestamps after the photos are posted might be impossible, and it would be hard to lose the evidence because erasing stuff on the internet is sort of hard.

Wow Jeff, is that your new house? Heckuva driveway.
