Perhaps the exposure settings play a big part as well.  Brenden at flightriot.com and myself (mostly him) have been experimenting with different camera settings.  I am very new to this all and still learning but it seems that the White Balance settings play a huge role in the overall quality.  Obviously the LUT is customizable and I believe that the processing end (imageJ/Fiji, ned horning plugin, etc.) are pretty straight forward (basically some addition/subtraction) so it has to be the exposure settings...right?
