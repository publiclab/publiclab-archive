I like this idea. We're soon going to be tweaking the auto-tweet function. We use IFTTT.com -- any suggestions? We currently use this recipe:

```
This Trigger fires every time a new item is added to the feed you specify.

Feed URL: 

http://publiclab.org/feed/liked.rss

(for feed URL requirements, visit the help page)

## Post a tweet

This Action will post a new tweet to your Twitter account. NOTE: Please adhere to Twitterâ€™s Rules and Terms of Service. 

Tweet text

{{EntryAuthor}} posted a research note: {{EntryUrl}} {{EntryTitle}}
EntryAuthor just shared: EntryUrl EntryTitle

```
