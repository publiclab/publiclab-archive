Wanted simply to upload a zip file with everything but for some reasons didn't work.  Anyway here is it:  https://repo.or.cz/purpleair-notify.git

It can run on any service but you will need a Iron Cache account and a private Discord server with webhook.  Mine runs on heroku.com free tier with Scheduler and Iron Cache add-ons.

Discord iOS app don't need to run in background.  Push notifications are working well, if Discord server doesn't miss to receive the message for some reasons.  Sometimes it does.  The upside for me are private channel and one single URL for access and authentication.

If you are interested to just see it working I can invite you to my Discord server.
