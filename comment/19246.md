[@liz](/profile/liz): the size can go from 10 to 200um, but most pollens of interest might be under 50 um. It could be a good assumption that on high pollen season, most particles under that range might be pollen associated??http://www-saps.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/pollen/index2.htm
[@warren](/profile/warren) the shapes can be very distinct. Maybe if we know the shape of the pollen grains that are predominant in our city, we could do something base on shape? https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275367002_Morphological_studies_of_the_pollen_grains_for_some_hydrophytes_in_coastal_Mediterranean_lakes_Egypt/figures?lo=1
Thank you both!
