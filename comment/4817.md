Ned, your explanation suggests that exposure is critical. The shadow in the close-up is essentially the same as the ones in the gigapan - a shadow of a person standing in the field. The difference is that the close-up was exposed for the average of shadow and sun, and the distant shots were exposed mostly for the sun-lit field so the shadows become darker. To avoid dark shadows, exposure compensation could be set to a positive number (e.g., +2/3), although that would tend to overexpose highlights. I guess dark shadows would have to be avoided in both channels (VIS and NIR). A good camera with greater dynamic range will also help.
