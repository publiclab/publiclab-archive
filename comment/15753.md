How could we list an activity as a connection or project? Or create a powertag for projects & organizations? We have activity categories.  Could we have project categories?  

I want to see how we could generate a wiki that could be populated through powertags on organizations and projects listed on publiclab.org--PhotoSynq, Air Quality Egg, Leptos, or the Appalachian Mountaintop Patrol--with power tags like project:connection, project:organization, etc.
