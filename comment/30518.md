         One of the endangered species is the Nashville crayfish, because of the pollution. Some of the endangered species are bobcats, wood storks, and foxes. The invasive species of the Florida everglades (Burmese Python) upsets the balance of the ecosystem. Due to the introduction of a new apex predator, not only it affect the ecosystem it also poses a danger to residential area because the Burmese Python can kill a whole human. 
         All species in a environment plays a crucial role in the balance of the ecosystem. A biotic factor like a invasive species that is not native to the environment can have devastating consequences. Most extinction event is because of natural causes. Endangered are species that is in a brink of extinction while threatened  species like bobcats in the Florida Everglades are dying off. 
          I want to thank Public Lab for allowing average citizens like us to voice our opinions regarding the environment and wellbeing of our community.
