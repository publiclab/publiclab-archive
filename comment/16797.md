I know the RIFFLE project has been doing this for a while now, but I saved SD power control to the end of my quest for low power logging, because I was worried about the potential weirdness that could arise with the Arduino libraries. 

But after a reasonably thorough round of testing it does seem to be working OK with a BJT switch on the ground line:
