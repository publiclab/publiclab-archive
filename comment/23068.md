It's awesome to hear about your participatory mapping work in Panama! It's great that you're testing out DigDem's Mapeo, I'm interested to try it myself. The big name out there for FOSS4G is definitely QGIS, but this article (https://gisgeography.com/free-gis-software/) from earlier this month has some desktop software that might be more simple for a less computer-literate community. It might require trying a few of them out yourself first, though, to find the most appropriate one. 

I've posted your question on a participatory mapping forum and will update my response if I hear from anyone with any more software suggestions, I would also love to hear what software you end up using with the community!
