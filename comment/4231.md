Hi Josh

I put a floppy disc tape in front of the lense and outside of the camera. This is mostly recommented for headtracking. I removed it and there is black space again. Also, the green light is on when connected to my pc and capture an image. I also tried to screw unscrew the lense cap while plugged in and noticed no difference. All black.
