We came across a lot of design challenges and setbacks, but my team and I have just conducted some full scale tests and we are very happy with the results. At this point we do not want to say that the design is totally successful until we collect more quantitive data and have time to formally analyze our findings. I will post a video below of our very first test outside below. Since that test we made some improvements on how to mount the string to the balloons, which greatly increased performance. Also we did not have our camera attached to the setup out of fear of losing it on an untested system. I should be mentioned that it is able to easily lift the 40 gram Mobius action camera recommended by Public Lab.
