[@stoft](/profile/stoft) hey Dave, ok here is a snipet of my concept for a tunable LED, it is based on a bi-color led, the red and green type, instead it is sandwiched with all 3 primary colors ( red,blue and green) it can then be tuned within a given range by selecting their operating drive current in order to obtain a precise wavelength. The LED would have to operate at the 1W to 5W range for proper luminance.

These LEDs can still be driven by any PC's USB port which would give this spectrometer superior reliability and maximum portability and still remain at a very reasonable cost.

Well that's my concept, now my primary goal is to get both spectrometers I have built to operate correctly, I work off the OMLC reference because it's the only reliable one I can find, but it is an old reference from the 90's, which it shouldn't really matter, here at Plab other than you, no one that I've seen puts in the work in this area. I'd love to compare against other spectra's but there are none, now as far as the 3.0 is concerned, it's concept was already instituted back in 2009

at the Department of Chemistry University of Illinois, to me it's potential is really begin wasted, I haven't seen it utilized in any meaningful way. Unless it's nothing more than just a selling point in a marketing campaign.

Anyway, I will continue to experiment with both of my spectrometers until I get one of them to match the desired spectrum, then I can move forward to the next logical step.
