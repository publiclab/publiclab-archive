8-Bit resolution is fine i'd think, you just need to amplify the signal. Any first year electrical engineering student worth her salt can design this circuit for you. I wish I had an electronics forum to send you to, but it's not my bag and I don't know a site. 

Reading on it looks like the ADA Fruit might get you there. You just need to do some controlled testing to see that it is really linear output for ppbs of the gas you are monitoring and to see where in the line/curve temperature effects it and whether that is a linear step change in output or a more complete function to control for. 

Maybe try https://electronics.stackexchange.com/ ? Stack Exchange sites are dependent on traffic for views to get good answers and this one looks a bit small, but worth a shot. It really is very basic to amplify a DC signal from low voltage range [0, 0.1] V range to [0,5] V range.
