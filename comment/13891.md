Hi Dave, I'm also curious about the details of your setup. I don't see any fluorescence in you scans, which is confusing... Can you post some photos of how you're set up and how the light is passing through the sample, not only for this but for tests like in your earlier note at https://publiclab.org/notes/dhaffnersr/03-11-2016/tested-10-380nm-uv-leds-with-10w40mtr-oil-thru-quartz-cuvette ?

Thanks. Some more context and process documentation would be very helpful, as Dave Stoft points out.
