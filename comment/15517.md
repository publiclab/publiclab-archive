That's really interesting. Someone at LEAFFEST -- a lawyer or maybe law student? friend of Molly's -- mentioned the "historical" status of photographic evidence on a "fair likeness" standard -- and that photographs needn't necessarily even be authenticated by the photographer, but that anyone can vouch that a photograph is a "fair likeness" of what it's intended to represent. I'd love to learn more!
