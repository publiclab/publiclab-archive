Id also like to add, before conducting more sampling and testing, its important to reflect on the reason for your concern. Do you want to grow a garden? are you interested in a general overview - if there is contamination and what it may be. Is this an area where there are children playing? The hanby kit only tests for PAH's .. metal testing may be of interest to you too..lead.. arsenic..?? so so important to sample areas that folks are potentially exposed to. what is your inquiry question ?
