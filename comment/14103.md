Unfortunately, I'm unable to extract any meaningful observations from this collection of numbers and plots and I suspect other readers will be confused as well. There appears to be a range of inconsistent use of terminology and there is no information included to show how any of the data was obtained; eg photon, shot, flicker, flicker factor, background flicker factor, detector noise, signal source, etc. While the title references SNR, that appears to never be calculated or explained and the plots indicate an inconsistent signal amplitude making SNR measurements re. slit width questionable. Since the data appears to have been taken over 30 sec, it seems illogical that slit width would have any affect on any of the noise components of the CCD detector so I have grave doubts about all of this data. SNR vs slit width would need to be measured using a constant signal amplitude at the detector.
