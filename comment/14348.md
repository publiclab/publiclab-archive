Yes, it's called quantization; the camera only has 8-bits and the scale of the two plots is likely about 3-5x different. Take a look at the 'red' plot and the vertical 'size' of the smallest increment .... then look at the 'averaged' smallest increment. If this is not the case, then I'd suspect the math used in doing the averaging: you want: int16( (double(r)+double(g)+double(b))/3.0 ) or the equivalent and then plot on the same plot with the same scale.
