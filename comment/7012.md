Thanks! I'm definitely headed in the right direction -- I have more variation than before. However, I'd like to double check that my white balance seems accurate. I'm still getting green colors on the building, but even in the example river.jpg image provided, the sky is marked partially green (http://infrapix.pvos.org/show/river.jpg).

These are three sample images I took and uploaded to infrapix: 

1. http://infrapix.pvos.org/show/IMG_0074.JPG
2. http://infrapix.pvos.org/show/IMG_0075.JPG
