I have done many calibrations to correlate Conductivity vs TDS.
One thing that I have found out it will only work for one Creek, river or any surface water. Meaning you will have to calibrate your conductivity reading and take one representative sample of the same site and measure TDS according to EPA methods. If you do these readings and sample taken, TDS analysis for several times during dry and raining periods, eventually, you will get a quite robust correlation graph. Good luck. 
If you are going to measure turbidity you could do the same procedure. Use a turbidity meter or measure TSS (Total Suspended Solids) EPA standard methods.
