Hi Max-

The microscopes have just one magnification--the lenses are fixed. Most of the upgrade webcams show a field about 1-1.5mm across, while the basic lenses tend to have slightly higher magnification, but less resolution. It does tend to vary slightly from batch to batch.

We discovered this by accident, but by *not* inverting the lens, it's possible to do some nice macro photography. I'll take a look with a calibration slide to see where we're at. 

We've also assembled a few rigs to work with smartphone or tablet cameras-- these actually *can* focus, and do a pretty nice job. The amount of focus/zoom depends a bit on the camera and if you're shooting photos or vide. 

We can update with some more info about specifics!
