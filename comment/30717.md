Fixation-- a process that makes nitrogen gas convert into a more usable form.
Assimilation-the absorption and digestion of food or nutrients by the body or any biological system.
Decomposition-the state or process of rotting; decay.
Ammonification- any chemical reaction in which NH2 groups are converted into ammonia or its ionic form, ammonium (NH4+), as a product.
Nitrification- the process of combining, mixing, or filling with nitrogen or one of its compounds especially the oxidation of ammonium salts to nitrites and then to nitrates. Nitrification
Denitrification- the conversion of soil nitrate to the nitrogen gases N2O and N2 by a diverse array of bacteria that use nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen.
