There's still some clipping (source light intensity too high) so a comparison, using a cardboard mask (with a small hole in it), between the two bulb types might be helpful in diagnosing if there is an association between bulb intensities or if the difference is related to having a wide-angle light source -- or, perhaps, related to spectral differences between various physical regions of the CFL.. If the Mfg of the bulb were the same that would eliminate another variable.
