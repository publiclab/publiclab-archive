[@bhamster](/profile/bhamster)  I just became aware of this thread. My profile has notifications settings on but received none. Who knows why. 

For the record my solution currently relies on [Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) with a minimum period of 10 minutes. For myself I set to receive once every 30 minutes since donâ€™t like being flooded with notifications. My reaction to particulate pollution  became progressively more relaxed after setting up a good purifier and notifications for when to use it. 

If I understand the original post correctly, sensor checking occurred once every few days so my solution may work to improve response time.
