Great overview! Also, if you're looking to test a sensor, there's a chance that SCAQMD AQ-SPEC may test it if they haven't before. They have a list of previously tested sensors and results [on their website](http://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/evaluations), and [their protocol](http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/aq-spec/protocols/sensors-field-testing-protocol.pdf?sfvrsn=0) is a good place to look if you need ideas for your own set up and methods.
