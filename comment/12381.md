Hooray 360Â°!  Those are nice crisp photos. I like the false color IR. What filter and white balance setting did you use?  There was no post processing?

The tubing in the photos is a good cautionary tale. Did MS ICE stitch them all together even with the tubing in each photo? 

It's great to know that the S100 can handle the fast version of that mode. It must have been taking a photo every two seconds?

I understand what this guy is experiencing:

Congratulations on the successful flight.
