That helps a ton! Not only do I see the spectra, I can even photograph them. Here are some shots of what I built, and a spectrum from the cloudy sky (the sun) and a ceiling light (halogen). Now that I know how to find the spectra, I'll work on improving the images, etc. I'll also build a nice black one.

Thanks for your patience and guidance!
