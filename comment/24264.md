 Hello, my input might guide you in the right direction.
Different environments require different settings so it might be hard to generalize. 
I did some testing with a red filter today and found that using the settings 0.74 for red and 1.18 for blue generated good results. 
As a general rule of thumb you need to have higher values for the blue channel when using a red filter. Keep changing the values until the image captured has an even mix of red and blue. 
I use a python script I wrote to calibrate my camera. You can find it here: https://github.com/PiddePannkauga/PiCameraGui
