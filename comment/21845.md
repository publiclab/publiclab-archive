These are really nice bee images. If your goal is to make a seamless composite, the free [Microsoft ICE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/computational-photography-applications/image-composite-editor/) (Windows only) will stitch the photos into a single image and blend them together.

This seemed to reveal that there is a narrow slice without coverage. ICE will fill in missing parts of an image:

ICE doesn't do much else, so it's really easy to use.
