This is a great guide! Thanks [@laurel_mire](/profile/laurel_mire) -- you may also be interested in this new workflow by [@barun1024](/profile/barun1024) from our [#gsoc](/tag/gsoc) Google Summer of Code program who made a system for pulling spreadsheet based maps into [Leaflet Environmental Layers](https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-environmental-layers) (LEL), for display alongside a variety of environmental data layers like SkyTruth, TRI, as well as JusticeMap and other relevant demographic information. It's very much in progress but might link nicely with the workflow you've described here. MapBox to my memory used to be Leaflet compatible as well so integration could be not too hard.

Barun focused on a workflow which would permanently add a spreadsheet layer to the collection of layers that make up LEL, and would not require knowledge of coding to initiate the process of integration. So a little different goal, but related! Enjoy!
