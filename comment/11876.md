After further discussions with my mechanical engineer friend:  If you use the manometer with tees and an orifice between them the orifice should be close to 0.0198" to have a differential reading on the manometer of about 3" for a flow rate of 0.3lpm.  That would all need to be calibrated of course.  The operation would then be 1) verify the manometer is vertical [important] 2) verify an appropriate level of water in the manometer. 3) place the scale 0 on the meniscus with the pump turned off [The scale can be calibrated to use 1/2 the differential reading for easier use.] 4) prepare tube 5) turn on pump 6) adjust needle valve so meniscus moves to the calibrated 0.3lpm mark 5) . . .

That is of course if this approach is pursued.
