It will be relatively easy for me to take out the slit adjusting mechanism and move it further from the diffraction grating adjustment by adding an extra piece of rainwater tube. It would be difficult to get the slit adjusting mechanism much closer to the diffraction grating adjustment. What sort of distance would you recommend between the slit and the diffraction grating. I noticed somewhere that the camera should really be focused on the slit, so moving the slit further from the diffraction grating should improve the focus. 

I still have to add a fixed light source, such as a CFL bulb; would you have any recommended distance between the light source and the slit? At the moment I just hold my spectrometer near the CFL bulb.
