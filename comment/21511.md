Awesome and good luck with your computer! 

I had also thought we could incorporate the checkboxes for each popular tag into this popup as well, if we could make it look simple. Don't want to overcomplicate! Maybe `Subscribe to this post's topics | Select topics + ` so they're hidden and all checked by default, but if you expand, you can uncheck some? I'm not sure.
