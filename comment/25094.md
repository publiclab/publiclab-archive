Good to see your project.
1. In the code the TX , RX pins mention Board associated as Arduino UNO but you are using Mega. Kindly check the pin connections.
RX pin of Board as to be TX pin of PM sensor and same for TX as well.

2. Links where you can find detailed information 👍

3. This link is from Adafruit. Check for the board and PM sensor variant and modify accordingly.

Hope this helps.
