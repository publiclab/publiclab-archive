If you want to replace the image with the questionable text "Red, Green, Blue" with one modified to include only "Red," you can find it [here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/ndvi-plots-ir-kit). I modified the image in 2012 when I used it on that wiki page.

One reason the original image said "Red, Green, Blue" is that the original Public Lab one-camera NDVI system used a blue filter and the blue channel was used for visible light in computation of NDVI.
