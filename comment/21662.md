 To **ALL Google Code-In Participants**. I want to congratulate all of you üéâ , because, just by participating and dedicating your time in GCI, you have contributed to Open Source World üåê . Some of you might have raised your first PR, some might have contributed first-time for an organization, and what not, but I guess, everyone learnt something new. 

The Open Source world is huge and full of opportunities, it's full of learning steps and it's up to you how much you explore. There are many Open Source programs which you can explore - GSoC, RGSoC, Outreachy, etc. As you have got familiar with FOSS, you can start preparing for these programs(if eligible). We at Public Lab participates in many of these programs, so have resourceful alumni available, so feel free to contact for suggestions, advice, etc. 

By means of FOSS, developers give back to the communities which build something meaningful for society, for their work, so we hope as you have learned from GCI, you would help us in coordinating GCI this year by becoming mentors, helping someone in completing their first PR or OSS journey and you can participate too(if eligible).  

I really loved every bit of collaborating with you all and yes learnt so much. Thanks for making this winter full of code.

All the best for your future endeavors and would love to collaborate with you all again. 

Thank you all ‚ù§Ô∏è

P.S: Some Open source program like Outreachy don't allow GSoC students(if I remember correctly), so plan accordingly in which program, you want to participate in which order :)
