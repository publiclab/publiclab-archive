Ned,
This is a dramatic result.  It is startling to see that the color can be completely removed by applying a custom white balance, and also that this can be done by simply pointing the camera at grass while the camera computes the custom white balance. Do you have any idea how this will affect the resulting NRG (false color IR) or NDVI images? 

Much of the manipulation done during the custom white balance procedure might be to laterally slide the R, G, and B histograms independently to remove any tint bias in the image.  It might not change the shape of any of the individual histograms very much. When an NRG or NDVI image is produced, only one of the channels (usually blue or red) from the infrared photo is used (in combination with data from a normal color image of the same scene). So the relationship among the three channels in the infrared photo might not matter much.   

I have not done any tests yet, but I will hypothesize that a good white balance on the NIR photo will not have much effect on the NRG or NDVI images that result.  This might be especially true when the new histogram stretching options of your ImageJ plugin are used while producing NRG and NDVI images. These options intentionally widen and center the histogram of the single NIR channel being used, and I assume have more impact on the outcome than the white balance of the original NIR photo.
