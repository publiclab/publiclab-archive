Chris,

You are probably correct about the foil being a poor material because of how shiny it is, had not really considered that. I came across this: http://www.azooptics.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=415 as chalkboard paint should be easy to get, but what I do not understand from the first graph in that like is the scale goes to 250% reflectance. There is a poor explanation as to why this is. Is this a normal thing for reflectance measurements? If I can go by that information there do you think chalkboard paint would be good? Ca. 25% reflectance across the spectrum.

Thank you,
Andrew
