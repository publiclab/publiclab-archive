 I'd also like to reconnect with the design discussions that are ongoing for other pages, in particular the dashboard. I think some of the latest mockups there could present some possibilities for organizing tags/topics, esp as the dashboard potentially pivots to displaying a list of topics instead of a list of posts:

The map space could be used to display the tags visualization, or some tag trends like leading active tags... Like in Cess' page here:
