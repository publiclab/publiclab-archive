So, I didn’t receive the black piece of cardboard. No big deal I can work with that. What is a problem is that I cannot see any way to connect the Raspberry Pi camera to the Raspberry Pi. The ribbon from camera is not compatible with the computer board and the cable provided with the Raspberry Pi is 40mm long so it’s not working. Have to say I’m a little disappointed. The idea of a kit is that it’s everything you need, now I’m scrounging pieces and ordering cables.
