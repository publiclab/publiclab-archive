Super. I hope we can get the stepping to work, though most of all for the desktop kits -- imagine not doing any more lasercutting! And while some phone cameras seem to avoid too much clipping, the webcams are def. not as good at it. If you have a chance to do daylight and CFL spectra with the stepped slit, that'd be great to see!
