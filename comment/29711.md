I learned from the video today that Dr. Scott Coffins job is to find information on microplastics and their influence on humans. He says that the plastics found are found in our bodies and have negative effects on us.  Dr. Coffin pushed for more people to become aware of these microplastics because there was little to no information on them. I also learned why traditional and non traditional plastics differ.
