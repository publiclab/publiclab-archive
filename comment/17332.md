Hi [@MadTinker](/profile/MadTinker), I feel very sorry for RTC (also for the cable, and many other things...) 
When I make this guideline, DFRobot did't have the RTC I'm using in their store yet, and I was told it can be replaced by another older one. But soon, the new product released, and I didn't update the list in time. 
BTW, will you go to Public Lab Barnraising at Louisiana? I'll go. so I am thinking maybe I could drop by your place in October and bring you some of knowflow's new designs.
