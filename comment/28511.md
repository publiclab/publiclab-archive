Hey [@barun1024](/profile/barun1024), thanks for the awesome review 🙌 

> I can see this in the proposal, I would prefer something the entire new integration to be in a separate folder like /app/v2/views instead of individual files being renamed, that would seem more idiomatic i guess.

**+1** on this! I think a separate folder would ease the process of migration on a new version but we also need to look into the number of files that will be changed. If the number of files to be modified are less then there's probably no need for that. ✌🏻


> Agreeing to Jeff on the awesome visually compelling timeline, let me know how did you make it! I might wanna grab that as well 😝

Thanks, the timeline was created using [this](https://www.visme.co/templates/infographics/nonprofit-communication-plan-timeline--infographic-1425277758/) template as a reference :D.

> P.s. It would be great if you could review my proposal as well😺

Sure will do A. S. A. I'll get time 😄.
