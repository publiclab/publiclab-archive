This isn't actually a classification. I was generating different layers from the 4-band (red, green, blue, near-IR) images collected a few weeks ago to improve classification results and this is one of the images that was created. The generated images included band subtractions, band ratios like NDVI, texture images, and principal component images. The black and white image in Chris' animation is the 4th principal component image derived from the 4-band image. If this highlights water chestnut it's shear luck. I still need to run some experiment with other images (I've only tried two so far) with different resolutions. My expectation is that at the very least this will be an important layer to add to the classification but it might actually be a quick and dirty way to create a nice overview of likely water chestnut areas. An option for creating principal component images can be added to the plugin if there's an interest.
