Thank you for your immediate response Chris. This is very helpful!

Regarding modifying the values in the red channel of the aerial photos, I have read that there is a ratio of blue (NIR) that needs to be subtracted from Red to compensate for the NIR contamination. However, I struggle with the amount of blue that must be subtracted from Red, as I don't know the basis for this amount. 

Information on spectral sensitivity of my camera would have been useful for this, however, there is no available data on it upon research.
