Hi Dave,

Sorry for getting back to you this late.

I agree with you completely. I had the idea of using the data as 2D imagery at the first. But after a series of discussions with you, Jeff and some others, I am using the plots data directly, the % and wavelength. -- You might be aware of this as we had discussed this on the mailing list. Posting a new research note now covering all the work I have done so far. I request you to critically review it :-)
