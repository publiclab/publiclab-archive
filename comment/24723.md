 Hi [@molangmuir10](/profile/molangmuir10)! [@jywarren](/profile/jywarren) has told me you and [@silentsairam](/profile/silentsairam) have been running mapping events and providing input on UI work with Mapknitter. If you have a minute, I would love your input on the toolbar UI updates I made in its upstream repo (Leaflet.DistortableImage):

Sorry for using your question to ask - wasn't sure how else to reach out! Thank you :)
