Interesting thought. I'll suggest using blue and red LEDs which then allows monitoring apparent wavelength shifts as well (when slit and camera or if grating and camera have relative position shift). There can be 'intensity' shifts (at a pixel position) when the entire device moves relative to the light source so, while testing, the device / source position cannot change if you want to measure the device's weakness.
