Thanks! I've made a chart where we could mark them for "good" and "bad" and add other notes; I hope it's roughly correct:

[![Screen_Shot_2019-05-10_at_12.34.23_PM.png](/i/31873)](/i/31873?s=o)


But if it's not, it's the last slide of this presentation, if you want to make suggestions -- or you can make them here and I'll copy them in! Thanks a lot!!
