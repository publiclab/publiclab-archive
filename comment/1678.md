I'd been looking into decoding audio for an unrelated, semi-silly project some time ago: https://github.com/jywarren/hellschreiber-js

and by the way, if you can't figure out tone decoding, there's no shame in using full-on, full-off noise and measuring volume -- you can make short/long tones and basically do Morse code. Might not be a bad idea for a first implementation/proof-of-concept!
