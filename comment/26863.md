Another great source for infrared color photos: a Roscolux sample book of 200 filters, of which at least 50 - 80 filters are useful.

I ordered mine at Edmund Optical for about E 30, including shipping.  Not bad for that many filters! It is thin plastic foil material, and each filter has  a sheet with its own spectral curve in the visual range. Clicking on the color squares on their website even gives more info. Its purpose is illumination in dance halls, concerts and theatres.

Some results are more esthetic than others (green skies are ugly), which does not always says much about its scientific or practical value.  

Additional useful filters are: Floppy dics, 2 crossed polaroid filters and , surprisingly, some ND filters. Obviously, many pigments seem to be transparent in the IR, and many surprises can be expected...
