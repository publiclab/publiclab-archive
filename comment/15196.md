Also, I'm sort of collecting small issues, and especially HTML-based ones, that would make good `first-timers-only` issues. Here's what I've got so far:

* put "count" of answerers on the question posting form `# people have signed up to...` ([shown here]https://publiclab.org/notes/ananyo2012/08-20-2016/gsoc-2016-final-work-product-of-expanded-q-a-system-for-publiclab-org#Asking+questions)) in a green Bootstrap alert box
* Change pipe `|` separators for extra wide `&nbsp;` spaces in question search autocomplete
* Remove banners from sidebar in /questions page
* "Question: Question" doubleup (there's already an isssue for this)
