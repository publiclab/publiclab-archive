Hi Liz, Thanks! 

For the short term I'm working with Peter Sand at Manylabs, they're working on a beta Android app which can upload bluetooth data from sensor to their DataHub  https://www.manylabs.org/hub/data/ . Peter and Elliot are also working on a fancier cloud-based version which is in early development, see more at manydata.org. So that's the short term plan for the Louisville AQ project and other tinkering. But I'd love to develop compatibility to other systems, maybe AirCasting, open to other suggestions.
