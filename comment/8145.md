Hi eustatic,

The particulates sensor being used for the DustDuino could not identify the composition of the particulate matter, but indeed could be helpful for your investigation. It would be great to get in contact with you and see how I might be able to help. Feel free to shoot me an email at mschroyer@gmail.com.

Also, I have in-laws in both Ouachita Parish and Baton Rouge. Had a chance to do some drone mapping in Ouachita Parish in November: https://mapknitter.org/map/view/prairie-bayou-la
