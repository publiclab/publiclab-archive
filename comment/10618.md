I just realized the images shown in the research note are thumbnails. The threshold enhancement helped the thumbnails a lot.

Looking at the actual images, I'm not sure if threshold adds much. Maybe it's better for the first look, and then investigate the original in more detail?

Although I can see two partial fingerprints in the lower right thresholded image which was not visible in the original image. Maybe it did help.
