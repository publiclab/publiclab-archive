The items that I saw the most often was water bottles, plastic grocery bags, and soda cans. I think that it will take 20 to 500 years for those items to disintegrate, depending on the material and form. Polluted waterways can become toxic for humans, animals, and the environment. Drinking polluted water can lead to many health problems such as heart diseases and cancer.
