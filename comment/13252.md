> Tar Balls over time? 

Scott, I'd be really interested if you collected a set of a bunch of different tar ball spectra, esp. in different states of decay/weathering, to see how consistent they are. For example, multiple scans of the same sample at the same dilution, as you've done above, look pretty consistent. Is it possible to just collect a whole bunch of tar ball scans you've already done and add them to a single set?

Thanks, Scott, this is great!
