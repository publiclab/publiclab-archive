 After getting more familiar with the spectral-workbench.org and spectral-workbench.js, this is exactly what I need (offline app grounded in the spectral-workbench.js library) so it's a) faster and b) has a fast way to import, hopefully live, from a CSV from the raspberry pi. Electron sounds like the perfect place to build the app so it integrates easily with the spectral-workbench.js. It may need a custom export program for the pi, since the pi-builder IP camera software seems like it doesn't make use of the maximum capability of the pi camera and constant video streaming may be causing the system to run more slowly.
