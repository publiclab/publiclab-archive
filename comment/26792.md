Here's a portable GC, but has a TCD detector.. not the same. https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/brochures/5991-6041EN.pdf
No GC/MS portable unit. It can get pretty complicated and would need a seasoned analytical chemist to explain all the possible detectors that can be used with a GC.. it really depends on the application. The Bucket has been the standard tool in EJ work, because it is portable and easy to use.
