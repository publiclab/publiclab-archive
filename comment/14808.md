That's a really cool use case I hadn't heard of before! Is it something you've had luck with using the PL spectrometer, reading fruit? 

I imagine each type of fruit would present its own issues, as far as relections off the surface, shape of the surface, how to get a light-tight seal around the fruit, etc. 

But in general, do you find you can get useful spectra from the basic DSK design in this use case? Do you have any spectra on SWB showing fruit? Very cool stuff.
