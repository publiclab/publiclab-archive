Hi David - This is an interesting project. The reflection of the glass should affect the results as long as the reflection is not in the area of your calibration targets. If there is glass between the camera and the scene you are photographing that could have some impact on the results since the quality of the light might change as it passes through the glass. Water will have an effect on any near-infrared (NIR) imaging since most NIR light is absorbed by the water. 

Another possible problem is that you use the reflectance values for the calibration target I used and they might not be accurate for the targets you are using. It's possible that the values are similar but I don't know for sure. 

You didn't mention what type of filter you are using. From your settings screenshot it appears as if it is a blue filter. Is that what you are using? Another (perhaps the main) issue is that the settings screenshot is from the plugin that does not calculate or process the calibration information. For the calibration you need to use the "Calculate image calibration coefficients" plugin. Let me know if that helps.
