Over the last few days I've been busily reworking some aspects of the measurement. Now we have a much lower excitation voltage (currently 100mV, although this could be easily decreased further) in addition to much-improved buffering of the resulting output voltage (which was previously quite sensitive to digital noise). Hopefully I'll be able to put together some experiments demonstrating this over the weekend.
