 Hi [@rexagod](/profile/rexagod) - this looks really good and I'd love to see it incorporated. Thanks! But be aware, i don't think Google reads the proposals, and we treat the version here as the official version, so don't sweat copying into the PDF too much! This is just good detail to have as we evaluate all the proposals. Thanks a TON for your response!
