I think bouncing a light off the surface of a substance is not going to produce atomic or molecular emission. You have to excite the atoms or molecules. Without that excitation, you mostly learn about the reflective properties of a surface and usually not much about its elemental makeup. Raman spectroscopy uses a laser to interact with the molecules in a substance and then detect shifts in some (scattered?) wavelengths.  The Public Lab spectrometer is not there yet.

Some elements will produce emission lines when heated up a little (Na or Cu in a flame) and some will fluoresce at characteristic wavelengths when hit with higher energy light (a UV laser). An obstacle to detecting the signature wavelengths is that other emission in the gas flame or fluorescing substance is noise.
