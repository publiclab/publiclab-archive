It would be helpful to know how you made those photos (camera, filters, white balance). I am guessing they were made with an RPi NoIR camera with a blue filter with preset white balance settings. The brightness of all three channels is very similar so those photos will not allow direct computation of NDVI. An artificial white balance or calibration procedure is needed for that.
