Hi Jeff, 
Yes! You can rig up a hacked BabyLegs to work at the start or end of pipes, from spitting to sinks to dryer vents to sewage outfalls. Really you just need the tights and a way to keep them open & in place. We've emptied tubes of facewash into the tights and run water through them to isolate microbeads before and it worked quite well.
