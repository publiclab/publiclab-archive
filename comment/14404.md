I agree with [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) that such a process should encourage contributors to improve upon documenting their work and I think "PLab" can play a leading position in that trend. However, I also think the concept of a subset of all PLab 'members' as a review committee is both acceptable and necessary -- largely because it's the most efficient means of achieving critical-thinking on the filtering process. Many contributors are, in addition to their interest and enthusiasm, actually quite interested in feedback as well. I suspect a loosely-knit PLab version of an "accreditation body" is what is required to efficiently accomplish the organizing task and that such a group would neither be 'chartered' nor seek the same kind of roll that exists for science journal publishing. This is PLab, not Nature or JAMA we're talking about. The objective is not exclusivity or elitism but to raise the bar of aspiration toward better science and train those who aspire but do not yet understand. When there are anomalies, then deal with them openly; otherwise, get the job done and spend most of the effort to support the enthusiastic contributors to learn and contribute more science.
