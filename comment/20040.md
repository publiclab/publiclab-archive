Warren, for now, I just completely removed the grating. And actually, I no longer use a slice of DVD, I bought a set of gratings (an upgrade). When I had grating installed, I noticed that part of the image is covered, so I need to check why. But still after having the entire grating removed, still have 100% dark images when the lid is closed.
