A filter switcher is a viable solution, especially for small cameras. Cameras as large as Powershots might require a big, precise device in front of the lens to make sure the filter was aligned, stable, and allowed no light between the filter and lens. If a CMOS security camera will provide the resolution and lens quality you need, it should work fine.  If it produces pairs of red and NIR photos, the standard software we use to align and analyze them (Fiji) will work fine. I assume you would want programmatic control of the cameras and filters so the capture can be automated. That might be the great unknown if you buy a security cam with a filter switcher.

That’s an excellent article you linked to at Red.com. It suggests that a monochrome camera will get you maybe 20% greater resolution, but resolution is not the limiting factor with NDVI systems. Normal consumer cameras are workable, especially in two camera systems.  If computer control of the capture is not required, a two camera system with $50 Powershots is easy to make.  An unmodified camera will produce a broad red channel with some contamination. Another camera with the IR block filter replaced with a Wratten 87B will produce three NIR channels with little contamination. To reduce contamination of the red channel, put a Wratten 29 or other red filter in front of the lens. Or buy a narrow band pass filter with a range centered on 640-660 nm. They can be expensive, but sometimes can be found for < $100. [Chroma](http://www.chroma.com/) has one on sale now for $112.50:

.  
There are also others on sale. I bought this one for $65:

.  
These are generally only 32-35 mm in diameter, so are minimal for Powershots. They are also dichroic filters which are intended to work only for incoming light that is close to normal to the filter surface. So when placed in front of a lens, only the center of the image produced is filtered precisely, and the image appears vignetted. Here’s a photo with the $65 narrow band pass dichroic filter I bought:

.  
The vignetting is not so bad when the filter is held right against the lens, but I mounted this in an old 52mm filter ring which screws onto a filter tube which snaps onto a PowerShot A590:

.  
I haven’t yet made much progress determining if this will make the mother of all NDVI images.
