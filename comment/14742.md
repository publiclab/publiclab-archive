Thanks Chris! I'll reverse that nylon insert nut. 

Yes it does! That's one of the great features in Fusion 360, there's a plug-in that actually lets you browse the McMaster-Carr catalogue and insert STEP files directly into your model. If you're looking at the components in Fusion 360, they will be named using their part numbers from the catalogue. 

For this model, I included the McMaster-Carr part numbers in the comments of the Thingiverse post.
