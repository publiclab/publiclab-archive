Thank you for sharing your wonderful ideas and suggestions for the image sequencer [@vikky30singh](/profile/vikky30singh)

I would recommend that you pick a project from the ideas list here https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/9257 they are currently what we are looking to improve in Public Lab at the moment. 

We will be picking applicants based on their proposals from the ideas list.

Thank you once again. All the best!
