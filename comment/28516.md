Thanks for sharing [@gauravsingh2699](/profile/gauravsingh2699).

You have mentioned under the title `_DrupalContentTypeMap to Nodes_` that,` We can instead migrate all the 'map' type nodes to the 'notes' type nodes`. However, in the original post(https://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc-ideas#2021+Ideas) it says `merge and combine deprecated content types into standard ones; for example, Maps become Wiki pages`. Have you thought about why setting the maps as type notes is better than wiki?

I love the comprehensive research. You can add a section of possible FTOs that can be created from this, I suspect, they'll be a number.
