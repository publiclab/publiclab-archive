Hmm, very interesting -- without vertical scale its hard to say though - I believe the "plateaus" on the "average curve" are artifacts of the precision of the intensity data -- like, it can't record between the two, so it's jumping to the nearest intensity above or below. 

For example if precision were to the tenth of a value, if the real value were 0.15, we'd only see either 0.1 or 0.2. Make sense?
