Well , petroleum ether is a very common chemical is it use for dissolving paintings and for cleaning painting brushes, I am thinking that is possible that if you are trying to found petroleum in soil and you use water to extract the chemicals from the soil the petroleum won´t  leave the soil as the water is a POLAR solvent and I suppose that petroleum is a nonpolar substance so it´s only soluble in nonpolar solvents, so lets try with a non polar solvent I think you might get better results but I promise I will study that...and the metals you are looking for is difficult to Know but if the are salts, I suppose so( iron oxide, some metal sulfates...and some others) they are soluble in Polar solvents as the water.

If you are interested in the isolation technique please told me details of the sample you want to extract from and i will do it in my home lab and I will send you the results , If I   have access to it .
