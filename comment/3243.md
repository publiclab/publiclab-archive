Hi all, 
I have a question about White balancing.
As i have mentioned earlier, the modified camera RED band is mix of RED+NIR, green band is more NIR+less RED and Blue band is mostly NIR. When i apply custom white balance using gray card, the significant change i could see is on the RED band of the image, remaining other bands almost  similar before and after white balancing. What could be the reason that the RED band is more affected by the white balancing?? Anyone please can you sugest me?? Thanks in advance.
