[@warren](/profile/warren) is correct that some synthetic materials reflect a lot of NIR and not much red, so NDVI computes to a high value (NIR-red will be similar to NIR+red so NDVI will be close to 1.0).

How did you decide to use the setting (R-250, G-500, B-900)? I used 310, 500, 700 with a red filter (Wratten 25, see https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-26-2014/mobius-ndvi). What filter are you using?
