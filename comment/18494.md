HI [@warren](/profile/warren) 
sure I can post the notes on the [#shinyei](/tag/shinyei) in a different post, maybe as an answer of your question https://publiclab.org/q/15751...
We have just started to work with two different sensors for PM. The SDS011 and the Plantower 7003. I can put some info on both of them too.
Saludos
