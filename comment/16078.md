Hi Chris! Sorry I didn't get a notification you wrote in here, so just seeing this now (off to GitHub to report a bug next!). [@liz](/profile/liz) mentioned the Rational Equation [helpful link to figure this out here](http://www.lmnoeng.com/Hydrology/rational.php), but I feel like all those factors you are mentioning are really interesting and important and not necessarily taken into account on that method. 

One of reasons I'm interested is because we have a number of proposed stormwater projects happening here in New Orleans, and while we're thinking about methods to measure water depth, I was wondering how people estimate runoff/absorption before they start these type of projects.
