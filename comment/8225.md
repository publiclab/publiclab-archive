Hi Warren. Nice to meet you. 
Wrt cross posting, I am wondering about the content that would be most helpful to the audience here, as I interwove (with different types of navigation) posts for two very different audiences in the main project blog. And by cross posting, do you mean just posting links to new blog entries as I make them...or do you mean transferring the actual images and content? 

Perhaps I should keep the "narrative" posts at my site, and just cross post the "how to build" and technical updates to this forum? Those are the ones most likely to help someone else who is trying to make something. I think my pvc underwater housings would be especially useful to some of the water quality projects you have been sending to me.

Also, i'm still new to your site, so forgive me if it takes me a little while to figure out where everything is...in fact I don't even know where these comments are going yet.  (...found them...ha!)
