 Kites and balloons are prior to and different from UAS. they are not classified as "aircraft" becuase they are not dirigible (powered or steerable). They have their own regulations in [FAR 101](/wiki/balloon-mapping-regulations).  It is almost never the case that two sets of regulations encompass one type of object.  I haven't heard a peep about re-writing FAR 101-- those regs have been largely unchanged since the 1960's.  Some time in the late '90's early '00's the dropping of gliders from balloons and kites was banned, but that's the only change I know of in 50 years.
