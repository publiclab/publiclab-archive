I guess I'm way too late to weight in on this but perhaps I can contribute something.

At my work, we calibrate things both in wavelength and in intensity.  We buy these tungsten lamps that are calibrated and matched with a NIST source (about $4000 and calibration is good for a year).  The power supply for it is a high precision DC source.

My point is that a tungsten lamp with a stable power supply is a good source to use when calibrating for intensity.  If the current source is pretty consistent, then the number of photons coming out of it is too.  Distance to it from the camera's sensor is also important to measure.
