The lamp post, the wall, and parts of the tree trunk are all very dark. It is a common artifact that NDVI computed for dark areas of photos is not reliable and is often unrealistically high. Note that in your photos the NDVI is highest in the more shaded areas of the trees and shrubs. In darker areas Red+NIR will be smaller, and if the difference between Red and NIR (NIR-Red) stays constant then NDVI will be larger in shaded areas.
