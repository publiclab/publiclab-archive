I like your approach and like keeping the top-level choice up front. I'm also thinking that perhaps there should be a pre-defined list of categories as not all submitted notes are research; they range from just questions, to single observations, to construction sequences to piles of data without proper annotation. This also suggests having an 'Other' or 'Misc' category for entries which do not readily fit the pre-defined list. However, those could all be tagged either as 'request for review', or not, by the author.
