Hi Warren I'm also working on a beers law based machine for testing one cuvette at a time and measuring the amount of light penetrating through the sample. Now I know i'm kinda new to this group but do you think adding an arduino to a project would be to complex ? I wanted to increase the resolution and data being delivered so I added a GA1A12S202 Log-scale Analog Light Sensor and this requires an Arduino and a small amount of coding that I would of course provide when I publish this design. This circuit only has 3 wires to connect and can be done by most people I just wanted to throw the idea at someone that has more experience with Public Lab Members. Ohh and here are some photos of the light sensor and the machine I have designed.
