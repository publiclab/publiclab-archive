I've recently used just a flag-shaped piece of foam core and a swivel to stabilize my Mobius ([infragram p+s](/wiki/infragram-point-shoot)) and it worked pretty well, although I was very careful not to let it touch the ground. Because it's single-piece with no moving parts, its a bit more robust than a Canon with the lens extending and such. But it's probably a good idea to protect the lens more. Anyways this was nice since it weighed very little but still stopped it from spinning much. I reinforced the foam core with tape since it can sometimes break if pulled the wrong way:

Notice I rubber banded the camera on, but slipped a piece of rolled tape between to increase friction, and made little notches in the foam core. I also tried to be sure the rubber bands didn't overlap the metal pieces, which help to dissipate heat:
