Hi jaluna,
NDVI tells us something about plant health because it quantifies the difference between light that is absorbed by plant pigments and used for photosynthesis and light that is not used and is reflected from the leaves. Both blue and red light are used by plants for photosynthesis, and NIR light is not. Satellite and high altitude sensors always use red light because Rayleigh scattering by the atmosphere degrades the signal in the blue part of the spectrum. For very low elevation aerial photography (balloons, kites, or UAVs) and for normal ground based photography, the blue wavelengths provide an acceptable substitute for red. However, on hazy days, infrablue photos of landscapes can show a gradient in NDVI with distance because Rayleigh scattering effects blue light more than NIR.
