Any positive or negative controls you plan to test against just to make sure the device works?

I know when I was using VOC detectors a long time ago, they would fall out of calibration very easily and for any reason, like, from sitting in a warm room for a few days. We always had to test and calibrate our gas detectors immediately before putting them into use.

Additionally, it was easy to overload one of the VOC detectors we had. After it went positive one time, it was positive even when using negative controls. The sensor had been overwhelmed and could only report positive from then on.
