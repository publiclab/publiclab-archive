Ok well looks like this is already supported by writing the raw html in the note that is used then picked up by bootstrap. I just tried it on a research note and it seems to work, I can create sections that are collapsed by default and others that are open by default: http://publiclab.org/notes/walkerjeffd/08-13-2014/creating-collapse-able-sections-in-a-research-note

Would be cool to create a markup syntax that would generate the "accordian" code automatically, but I could also just write the html myself, not a big deal.
