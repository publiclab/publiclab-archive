I just noticed this great post from [@MicroscopesAreCool](/profile/MicroscopesAreCool) -- the microscope above is about half way between the laser lens microscope in their post and the Community Microscope. I'm *also* thinking about replacing the lower stage with wood for some extra weight, and while this version is using screws and hex nuts for focusing, I am scouting for some extra big rubber bands, because I think the traction focus is a little easier than adjusting from below the stage (though we'd have to find something that can easily support the weight of a tablet-- maybe even switching to the 3-bolt arrangement with a slightly less compressed spring would work.
