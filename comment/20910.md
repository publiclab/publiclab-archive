ImageSequencer is  a general purpose image processing program capable of creating NDVI composites. The proposed colormaps have been selected  primarily for NDVI analysis but could also be used for other applications. The pictures below provide additional information about each colormap (ImageSequencer  software code, origin data, past comments  from public lab and application reference).
