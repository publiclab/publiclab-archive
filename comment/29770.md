Thanks for this really great clarification/distinction. Another question, for outdoors in this case, but related more to the first of the above distinct questions, is:

> Does a humid day (outdoors) influence how much particulate matter is actually in the air?

That is, could moisture in the air cause particulates to fall out of the air? Or stay in the air longer? Or have any other effects on particulate prevalence, even if the amount of particulate matter being /put into the air/ is not changing vs. a dry day?
