I think it is par for the course that a random proprietary sensor will not work gracefully with an Arduino. In this case, it might be that a standard additional component (an ADC) is all that is needed to solve the electronic incompatibility issue. If that is true, then we are way ahead of the game. 

In addition to the electronic incompatibility issue, we must know how the signal from the proprietary sensor should be converted to meaningful units. If the manufacturer will not tell us, we should not blame Arduino for the extra work required. It is not so hard to create a calibration curve and then tell the Arduino how to convert mV into useful units.

There are many people who could confirm that the Adafruit ADC will solve the electronic issue. You might have to dive into another forum to get that answer. In the meantime, I just ordered a couple ADCs on eBay. The $15 (plus shipping) ADC at Adafruit has been cloned and costs $2.42 (including shipping) from eBay sellers. It will probably work just like the Adafruit version using the Adafruit libraries and the Adafruit code. I'm not sure I have an appropriate sensor to test it with, but my impression is that an ADC is a standard component that will come in handy some day, and for $2.42, there is no reason to miss the opportunity to open the mailbox later this month and find a present from Shenzhen.

*The top ADC is from Adafruit, the lower one is the $2.42 clone.*
