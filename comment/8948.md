Hi Liz,  No I haven't yet, but am planning to make the mapping the main topic of discussion during our lunch on May 8th.  I'm thinking that we need to understand the scope of the mapping project first before putting up a balloon, but then I am not entirely sure that I understand what putting up a balloon will do.  See you Thursday.
