Hi [@Tech4gt](/profile/Tech4gt), Sorry for taking so long to get back to you. It sounds like you have a good idea on how to approach this problem. But I think that writing a full end to end might not be the best use of your time (unless you want to dive into Java image analysis). If you look at the documentation of the SciKit-Image Python package, specifically under morphology you should be able to see how this was solved previously, usually, these packages are based on one or more algorithm which was published in a paper and would rely on other more basic work as well.
Have a look here for documentation on the way the label function works: http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.morphology.html#skimage.morphology.label

I don't mean to discourage you but to suggest that this might have been previously solved in an easy to implement way.

As for the step where you are looking at the number of pixels which are defining the perimeter if you correlate that with the area of a circle which closes that shape you should get a good correlation to the jaggedness of the particle.
