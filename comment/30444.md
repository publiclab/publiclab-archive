Environmental Science is an interdisciplinary field that studies how physical, chemical, and biological components of the environment interact with and affect organisms living in the environment. It’s a topic that has many different subjects relating to it. And one of the topics that greatly affect environmental science is Anthropology. Humans greatly affect the environment through population, the use of resources, and overall advancement in technology. Because of how we use resources in the environment and our carelessness of our surroundings, we cause damage to habitats, other organisms, and ourselves. 
The population is rapidly and constantly growing. This is because of the advancements in technology and the industrialization of nations. Even though this seems like a wonderful thing, it has serious downsides, one being the resources. We’re exhausting our resources as well as overproducing and overusing other products which causes excessive waste. This leads to people starving and dehydrated because they have n way to access food or water. There are also many sicknesses humans can contract that can cause death. Even though the factors I previously stated can all cause death, people are still being born in alarming rates. For every 1 death there are 4 births. Many people also can’t afford or don’t have access to healthcare which can lead to devasting affects not only on the people but on the environment as well. The health sector contributes to damaging and degrading the environment. Health care has a huge natural footprint as well as its waste production. And if you can’t afford health care that means you can’t get treated if you have serious conditions, if these conditions are treated there’s a possibility that other people can be affected in more ways than one. 
Environmental science is a significant and serious topic. It’s something that affects everyone and every living thing of this planet, it’s of a great concern. And the way we treat the planet; the things we do; how we live our life- it al changes the world we live in. Disciplines like population, birth death, food, water, and healthcare are al changes factors. Some of these disciplines grow exponentially while others are quickly depleting.  So, to answer the question of how these factors affect the world is simple. They don’t just affect the world’s future but define it.
