Hi, can you check if the (former) outer edge of your DVD, the rounded edge, is towards the top of the box? Try giving it a 90 degree turn?

Otherwise i think the exact angle may be important. Can you upload a picture taken through the webcam with and without the lid open? 

Thanks and sorry you're having some trouble!
