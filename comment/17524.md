Wow, these are scary pics and I'm so glad to hear about the success of this meeting. I hear you on the "using an expert" part. Zooniverse makes up for the expert by having many people review same images. Somehow things even out in the end for accuracy. They also mention the issue of panning, which is why I have to learn more about distance and tiling. :). Oh hey, what was the level of expertise in the room? Did you have any mapping experts? Thanks for doing this--it just made my week to see something concrete happen to help with identifying pollution from storms.
