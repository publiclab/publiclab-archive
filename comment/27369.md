Hi [@lelex76](/profile/lelex76) , thanks for your question. Are you asking about whether it would be possible to link a radio ground station to the internet along with geolocation data? Something like this exists- it's called WebSDR and it is a site that allows anyone in the world to tune-in to different antennas and ground stations in real time. 
http://websdr.org/
However not all of the antennas on WebSDR are able to decode satellite signals. Many of them are HF (high frequency) antennas primed for ham radio reception. I think it would be really cool if Satellite Ground Stations could be accessed in a similar way on the internet. If anyone else on this forum knows if this is already happening, do flag!
