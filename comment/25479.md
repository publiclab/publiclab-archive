> Hey [@Skorex](/profile/Skorex)!  Sorry for the delay. I'm not sure if you're looking for a measurement of the actual spectrometer that you have photographed, or if you are looking for a measurement of a particular spectrum that you created in spectral workbench (SW).  If it's a spectrum from SW, see this question that was recently asked here.  Feel free to comment over there if you'd like more help since it will notify all of the people already in that thread.
