i tried and failed to make a max patch like this last year.  The issue I was facing was that the calculations need to 1) allow for negative numbers, and 2) perform floating point operations.  The standard matrix objects are 8-bit CHAR (integer) matrixes that only allow values from 0-255.  Jitter can definitely do this calculation I just couldn't figure out how to successfully build a floating point matrix, do the math, and then convert it back.  I was playing around with using the jit.expr option and am pretty sure that it has to be used for all the math operations rather than the integer-only standard objects.
