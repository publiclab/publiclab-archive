[@abdul](/profile/abdul), I'd not consider superglue because of it's negative properties for human skin -- a safety hazard. Remember, the kits are sold for educational purposes (kids). Wood glues of most types are pretty safe.

[@warren](/profile/warren), also remember that the total volume of glue required for a kit is actually very small so "small alternate containers" could be available. EG: ULine has 2-oz soft squeeze empty glue bottles for $0.75ea in quantity and you only need to fill them with 1/2 oz of glue. 1Gal of elmers yellow is $35 on Amazon so 250 1/2-oz fills would be $0.14 glue + $0.75/bottle < $1. Pretty cheap for the kit.
