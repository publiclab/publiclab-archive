This looks so great! I'd be interested in contributing -- is the code open source somewhere I can take a look? 

Also, I'd tried to connect you with Naya Martinez who was at the barnraising, who has a lot of experience with odor logs, in paper form. I'm sure some of the paper version could be adapted, perhaps the specific multiple choice phrasing, etc. Naya is [@CCEJN](/profile/CCEJN) on this site -- she should get a notification of this comment. 

Naya -- do you have a copy of the paper odor logs you work with, that you could share?
