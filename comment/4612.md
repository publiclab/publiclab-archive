Hi, Dave - a few thoughts -- 

> the DOF is high so this is very hard to do with any accuracy

I've taken this as a very good thing -- as in, the large DOF means the spectra will be sharp in a wide range of focuses.

> 4" vs. 6" vs 9"

the original kit said 3" and many people showed that that was not very sharp. We redid it a few times and settled on 9" as an OK medium. You'll notice that both 6" and 9" show both a double green line and a double yellow line, indicating sharp focus. There is however a sharper region in the red, a double line which seems to show better at 9", no? 

We'll have to double check for the SANM camera too, of course, but it's great to see this clear presentation of focus. 

Congrats on a great note!
