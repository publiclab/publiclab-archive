Hi [@warren](/profile/warren) !

First of all thank you for your response . I am applying for GSoC not Outreachy , it is mentioned in heading of this post as well.
Now coming on to what I am thinking about tasks let say "Refine the design and details of the newly relaunched dashboard with community input." this task , see as you can see in current dashboard it is simply written that what you have performed till now but along with that we can use graphs to show user's weekly performance based on numbers of his/her research notes etc (like we have a performance visualizer on gitlub as well). As this makes dashboard more visualizing and i believe visualization makes our dashboard more user friendly. Also as it is mentioned in proposal that i will add a drafts section on dashboard which help user to keep track of his/her drafts. Along with this we must keep in mind the responsiveness factor of dashboard.
I hope this makes sense to you, please tell me your opinion regarding this so that we can modify accordingly.

Thank you 

Regards
