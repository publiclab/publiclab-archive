Hi [@warren](/profile/warren), [@liz](/profile/liz), [@roberts_ecofarm](/profile/roberts_ecofarm), [@read_holman](/profile/read_holman), [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano), [@oorjit_chowdhary](/profile/oorjit_chowdhary), and everyone else, and Happy New Year! :) <br>

I've started working on the questions page design - but please feel free to still comment on the dashboard design, more than happy to change things :) <br>

The questions design is also following the 3-column design. I do think that makes it cleaner and easier to digest more information at a glance. <br>

Besides the layout, I've also added: <br>
1. 'My questions' filter (the ability to filter questions by those that were authored by the user) <br>
2. I've combined the Search and Write actions into one input. I think it's really important to encourage users to search before asking a new question <br>
3. I've added the 3 calls to action Answer, Hide and Follow for each question, to make it easier for users to interact (and hide questions that aren't interesting for the reader). <br>
4. I also removed the brief instructions on the top as the page is quite self-explanatory <br>

The design is available here: https://edieblu.github.io/pl-dashboard/ (you will have to scroll down) <br>

As always, please let me know your thoughts :) <br>

Thanks!
Eva
