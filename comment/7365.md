Oh yeah, I forgot I actually measured that, and you're right a little more NIR gets into the blue channel (I used a 735nm cutoff filter). I need to start reading [my own research notes](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/09-12-2013/moar-nir-tracking). So especially if you can correct for the NIR getting into the red channel, we need a filter like the Rosco [#026:](/n/026:)

.  

That would certainly improve the scattering problem. I wonder if it would work better with Jane?

What red filter are you using?
