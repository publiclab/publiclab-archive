Hi, [@aayushgupta1](/profile/aayushgupta1) - have you looked at some of the ways to accomplish the tasks in the proposal? For example, scheduled jobs using ActiveJob (i think it's called) and some of my suggestions from this comment: https://publiclab.org/notes/Khamba/03-13-2017/gsoc-proposal-email-notifications-overhaul#c16409

I think it's important to start thinking about how to break this up into self-contained, testable modules that do separate things, which you could implement once per week (for example). Seeing a little more research into how to do things like run scheduled actions and collect all subscriptions and run through them to send emails, would be a helpful addition. Thanks!
