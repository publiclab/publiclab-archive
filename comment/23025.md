In the lab where both epa and fda testing was done, we always used the turbidity meter.  We used color comparison tubes, too, just not for turbidity.

It depends on the requirements of the government.  In the US, this is the EPA.  If both tubes and meters are ok, then it breaks down to cost and speed.  

I haven't seen a commercial lab that uses tubes.
