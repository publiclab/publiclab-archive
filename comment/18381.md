Hi [@jpschaaf](/profile/jpschaaf) You are right! The kits should come with 4 x 3036 plates, not one as mentioned above. Regarding use of the 3004 bricks, which step in the process are you referring to? Right now on my end I see a need for 4.
Just to make sure, if you ordered a kit that arrived incomplete please email us at kits@publiclab.org so we can make it right!
