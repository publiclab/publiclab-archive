Hi - just wanted to connect the dots here between [@kh_machine](/profile/kh_machine), [@neilhendrick](/profile/neilhendrick), [@kgrevera](/profile/kgrevera), and [@lperovich](/profile/lperovich) - 

We discussed this a little bit in [this comment thread](/notes/neilhendrick/06-11-2015/thermal-fishing-bob-temperature-measurement-speed#c11949), but the issue with this approach is that it's not that the timer takes a certain number of seconds to update -- like, you start it and then at the end of a 6 second wait, it's done -- but that the mass of the sensor (and whatever it's touching) means that it "stays warm" or "stays cold" for a little while, even as you pass it through a different temperature water. So having multiple thermistors won't improve your latency -- they'll all take that long, and they'll likely all be the same temperature. 

The discussion I linked to suggested either:

1. reducing the mass of the thermistor and whatever it's attached to
2. increasing the thermal conductivity (via higher surface area, like a radiator, or choosing a heat-conductive material, like metal)

...in order to reduce how long it takes for it to reach the ambient temperature.

That said, multiple thermistors at different depths would still be useful for measuring temperature at different depths. It just won't get you a *faster* temperature reading. Does that make sense?
