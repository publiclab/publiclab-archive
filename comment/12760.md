The blue filter did not seem to change the photo very much. The three channels are still very similar. Even for just a leaf (marquee below) the brightness of the three channels is almost the same:

To compute realistic NDVI directly from a photo, the channel used for NIR must be much brighter than the channel used for visible light. Healthy leaves reflect many times more NIR than visible light. To produce photos with the correct relationship between NIR and VIS, an artificial white balance setting on the camera is used. Below is a photo taken with a Rosco 2007 filter (probably the same filter you used) with a camera that had a custom white balance that exaggerated the red channel:

Here is an NDVI image made from that photo with the Photo Monitoring plugin for Fiji:

It is possible that the Raspberry Pi allows custom white balance before photos are taken. If so, it should be possible to capture photos that can be converted directly to NDVI. Otherwise it will be difficult.

Your results could improve by using different white balance settings (fluorescent, cloudy) and by taking photos in direct sunlight. Good exposure also helps. Dull photos never work.
