[Here is the one I got for Rosco](http://www.ebay.com/itm/HQRP-AC-Power-Adapter-DC-Coupler-fits-Canon-PowerShot-A1300-SX150-IS-A800-A810-/390473795816?pt=Camera_Cables_Cords&hash=item5aea0d48e8) and also a test to see if Jeff has implemented markdown in note comments.

This one mimics two AA batteries and should work on any Powershot that takes two AAs. But not all of them have little doors, so some surgery might be called for. I haven't looked for a list of Powershots that have little doors.
