[Hugin can also batch process images for lens distortion](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/Lens_correction_model.html) and has a collection of lens profiles.  I know [@Eustatic](/profile/Eustatic) has been using GIMP as well.  I think he has [a better note than this one somewhere.](/notes/eustatic/10-24-2014/mapping-the-nature-center)
