Congratulations on your assembly. However, the photos above suggest a misunderstanding about using the device. Remember, there is a 'slit' through which the light source must pass and that slit is a simple replacement for optics which would collimate the light ( all light in parallel lines ). You have the light source so close, that 1) the slit will not be able to provide semi-collimated light, 2) it will over-load the camera producing 'clipping' in the RGB channels from the camera and 3) it will easily illuminate the interior of the fold-up assembly you constructed and produce reflections which will cause unwanted 'signals'. Think of the light source you want to measure as needing to act like a distant star -- so all the rays which travel from it, through the slit and on to the diffraction grating and the camera -- will be parallel. Hope this helps.

Cheers, Dave
