Jeff, 

I made a corrected (ideal) version of the Snowy Sky CFL spectral image when we were working through this in October. This is the basis for the [Twin Peaks research note](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/10-06-2015/twin-peaks-tb-or-hg). This spectrum is an idealized model of what a perfect spectrum would look like if the major peaks matched the Wikipedia article with the one exception that the 542 nm green peak is not corrected to be at 543.5 nm. This idealized spectrum is the [CLF_CFL Corrected SnowySky](https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/show2/58696) spectrum.

I checked Dave Stoft's CFL spectra and they confirm that the two green lines are always farther apart than Spectral Workbench's reference spectrum says they should be.  If you know of some other good CFL spectra you can see if they confirm this observation.

Here's a weird thing. The spectrum that you are using as the reference spectrum for calibration is my [Corrected Snowy CFL](https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/show2/58584) spectrum (it has the two green lines too close together). When I try to calibrate that spectrum in Spectral Workbench it's spectral image lines up perfectly with the reference spectrum because the two are the exact same image. But the "Fit" is always turned up to 11. You would think that the Fit would be zero for that calibration, or at least better than 11.
