Hah. That's flattering, but my background isn't electrical engineering...I just kind of stumbled into it. The circuit is pretty obvious now that I actually think about it, and you're right, the pulses my phone is sending out don't make difference on the actual signal. 

This is the signal going into the phone with R3 @ 2.2k and C1 at 0.1ÂµF.

Also audio from Opera and Firefox. Same phone, still not working on either.
