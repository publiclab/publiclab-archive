[@mathew](/profile/mathew) Thanks!  I had meant to 3D print a container for the Shinyei but didnt have time.  I've seen some people have good success by incorporating a fan...if anyone has a 3D model for the shinyei and/or have experience attaching a fan I would love to see it.  

And thanks for the idea about longer measurement time periods.  I'll be interested to see the results....

And these scouts were AWESOME!! They were full of ideas for next steps and variations of testing that we'll try and do next time...
