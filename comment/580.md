I wonder if the IR filter is the limiting factor - my instinct is that low light level is more of an issue, and that the graininess is from ISO -- but i'm not really an expert on photographic tech. Another issue may be the auto-focus mechanism. I was wondering if it uses only one color channel to focus, as it might be marginally faster. Then blocking certain color sensors more than others could cause problems for the focus. Also to keep in mind is that infrared focuses at a different setting then normal light due to chromatic distortion. 

Maybe the color-focus theory could be tested by putting a red light in the foreground, a green light in the middle, and a blue light about 20 meters away, and seeing what the camera "likes" to focus on? But i don't really know if it'd help us improve the images. Interesting to explore though.
