I have some doubts regarding NIR Image.
we are using MIDOPT 660_850(RED_NIR only) lens to capture image( attachment: 660_850_Original.jpg).
Using 660_850 camera lens we are able to capture images.
NDVI  = (NIR-RED)/(NIR+RED)
So, Using 660_850 camera lens and using image processing we have to extract red image(attachment: 660_850_RED.jpg) from original image but we haven't idea how to extract NIR Image from the original image.
we are using OpenCV + PYTHON for image processing.
Using RED and NIR image only it is viable to process NDVI.

With Best Regards,

Please provide me a good solution.
