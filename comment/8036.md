The translucent algae might be diffusing the light and making it appear brighter at certain angles. If the light source is already diffuse, this effect of the algae might not be noticeable. Maybe something milky between the light and the dish would provide a more even light so the exact angle of the spectrometer (path from slit to grating) was not as critical. To get a better measurement of which wavelengths are absorbed by the algae, a continuous spectrum light source like a halogen bulb might be better.
