I think the issue is more for the workers than the visitors. There was an expose in the NYT last year or so? 

A lot of the work is being lead by women of color who are disproportionately exposed:

https://yorku.academia.edu/ReenaShadaan (most of her work isn't published yet)

I think Reena was telling me that there are also vacuum benches that suck plastic nail shavings and vocs away, which is a stopgap 'solution' for a body products industry that is dominated by petrochemicals. 

Dr. Zota has lots of good work one beauty EJ https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/environmental-and-occupational-health/ami-zota##Zota%20Environmental%20Injustice%20Beauty
