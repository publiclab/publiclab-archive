hello, I started a research with sensing of microplastics in ocean waters. [1]

As the idea is for the sensor to be embedded in the float, we don't want to use reagents in the sample sockets, so we discarded UV and started researching FTIR and polymer detection spectrum, a lot with the ATR technique, but we thought about doing just transmittance in the analysis cuvette.

here an explanatory video of the project with subtitles https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ienOsKmb7cA
