Hello.

I would like to measure every plant nutrient from macro to micro but I think macro nutrients(nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, sulfur, calcium and magnesium) will be enough for start.

I did find one article about using infrared spectroscopy to measure nutrient levels. It works for macro nutrients. Here is link to it: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423812002981
Is it possible to turn public lab spectrometer to infrared spectrometer?

If there is possibility to use Open lab spectrometer to measure nutrient levels. Could it work that I make hole in bottom of cuvette and lid that has hole and run nutrient solution from reservoir trough cuvette back to reservoir? This way I could gather real time data.
Real time data is not necessary but I would like to automate gathering of data at some point and this seems to be simplest way.
