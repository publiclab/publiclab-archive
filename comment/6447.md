Jeff -- great, promising set of experiments here!  Re: the color settings on the Infrapix app -- sorry, now I see (from your note, and in conversation with Chris just now) that having a particular color associated with a particular NDVI value is the better way to go, so that we can develop an common NDVI value-color association across pictures.  Instead, I'd set things up so that the app maximized the color differences among NDVI values in the image (which we could perhaps offer as a non-default option).  I'll change things over; and because I believe that previous infragram images should all be nicely stored on the server, I could also look into retroactively processing previous images ...
