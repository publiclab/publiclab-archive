[@marlokeno](/profile/marlokeno) pointed me to the US Dept. of Labor's [Mine Data Retrieval System](https://arlweb.msha.gov/drs/drshome.HTM) which indicates that Great Northern is currently abandoned.  

This is an interesting point, because an abandoned mine should be under active dust suppression and on its way to reclamation.
