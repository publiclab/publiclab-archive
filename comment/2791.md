Gregor -- *thanks* for that link!  I hadn't seen bootstrapsolar -- they're using almost precisely the same circuitry (though they went ahead and combined the two separate open hardware projects into one, nice board) -- and, as you say, they located cheaper components.  Great find!  I'll contact the fellow, point him to what we've done, and look to collaborate / get advice ...
