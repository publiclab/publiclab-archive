Wow, thanks for the feedback. hmm, as you have mentioned for commenting, a small comment button next to pencil button might do the job.

Yes, Due to the mentioned problems inline comment storage seems to be good. I am still thinking and researching about the issues with `suggestions` as you have mentioned. For a instance we could give notifications if a user is editing texts containing suggestions. But that may not be 100% solution. Have to think and research more on this. 

Thanks again for these info. I forked and learning about the `inline-markdown-editor`.  It would be great if you can share some links or notes to understand `publiclab/inline-markdown-editor`
