Hi Warren. I guess with the changes to the new version of Mapknitter, the operations on Images have been modified. 

1. Clicking on Add Border enables Delete option as this was in place of Add Border in the previous version.
2. Same way, last option Delete(Red with x mark is a nice feature) but does not perform any operation as of now.

Sharing the photo and video link (https://youtu.be/A96VpMmrxeE ) for reference. Also added the same under "Other options in Mapknitter" to the above post.
