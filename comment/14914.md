Wooden dowels are widely available, but they also vary widely in quality. Oak and sometimes maple dowels are fairly reliable and birch, poplar, and other woods are less so. Many hardware store dowels are imported, so the wood used is sometimes unknown. Some dowels are quite unsuitable for building camera rigs.

The no-tool rule is a nice goal, but most of your solutions require a screwdriver and pliers, maybe even in the field. Cutting the tubing and dowels requires a tool. A pin requires a drill to make the hole, but requires no tool in the field. So I'm not sure what the ultimate goal of the no-tool rule is. This is a DIY community, so tools are a big part of it.
