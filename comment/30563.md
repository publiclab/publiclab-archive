According to the EPA website, the atmosphere in Saint John Parish is in a moderate condition. In August of 2015, 71% of the parishâ€™s air quality is considered to be moderate. Only about 23% of the air quality is considered good. There is a small amount of air that is unhealthy to breathe. The emission of greenhouse gases is harming the air quality.Many refineries are located along the river road. They contribute the most to air pollution and the risk of contracting cancer is relatively high. The geosphere may be moderate in terms of its size and temperature. St. John is a parish rich in agriculture. Soil quality is important for the quality of the food we eat and the land we live on. Our hydrosphere is in poor condition.The water in the Mississippi River is unsafe to drink without proper treatment. Our biosphere is also unhealthy. Our area is called "Cancer Alley". The EPA has found that the mortality and birth weight of infants in St. John Parish are decreasing. Infants have a risk of experiencing health problems during their first year of life.
