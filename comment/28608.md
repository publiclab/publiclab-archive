It was a very interesting article!  Thank you for submitting it.

The microscope FTIR he mentions ran our lab $100k in the early 90s.  That was for instrument, libraries, etc.  It also took liquid nitrogen.  While prices have probably dropped, they may not have dropped that much.  Another option for identifying plastic nurdles is ATR (attenuated total reflectance). A much less expensive instrument can be used. Black color plastic is still a problem- it absorbs heat and light.
