Please look at the data sheet for the purple air sensors.  Specifically, the r2 data for the pm1.0, pm2.5, and pm 10. 

At least in the medical field, the correlation coefficients of 0.66 for pm10 is unacceptable.  On the other hand, the values for the pm1.0 and pm 2.5 were in the very good and good range.  

Depending on how you are using the data, this could have an affect.  Myself, I'd base data on the pm1.0 and pm2.5.  Whether you use the pm10 data is up to you.

Purple labs knew about the problem.

Silica is an interesting material.  Often having a very large surface area per volume ratio. So many strange things can happen.  Does your silica have a large surface area to volume ratio?
