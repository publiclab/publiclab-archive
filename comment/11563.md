From Kris Ansin...

"My favorite memory was getting a call from the environmentalist that ran Sea Shepherd and they needed an extra photographer to take pictures of the BP Oil Spill from a sea plane. Though not a photographer by trade, I leapt at the chance. The first several hours involved being marooned on a lake somewhere in the bayou, but once we went airborne, we got to fly over the site of the Deepwater Horizon spill itself, bearing witness up close to the fire, the spill, and the disaster. But it also represented a summer of working with people (Grassroots Mappers) who cared, deeply, operating at the intersections of justice, environment, and human rights, and I'm humbled that I got to see that so closely as well."
