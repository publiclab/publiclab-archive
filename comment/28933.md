Thanks for outlining these additional considerations [@fongvania](/profile/fongvania)!

For context, this question came from a community member during a public event for the [last research area review on soil contamination](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/04-07-2021/wrapping-up-a-research-area-review-on-soil-contamination#Some+questions+and+challenges+that+came+up+on+the+call:). And a great example of blending community-led science and conventional lab analysis comes from Citizen Science Community Resources' Soil Sampling Toolkit (created by [@jjcreedon](/profile/jjcreedon)). Here's [a video](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/04-07-2021/soil-sampling-toolkit-by-citizen-science-community-resources-history-and-how-to-video) where Jackie and Mike of CSCR explain the Toolkit's history and how it works.
