[@Jayesh](/profile/Jayesh), Hi!

Re: Tips on the spectrometer.  Well, I basically just made it up as I went along, guided by the fine work by the fine folks at PublicLaboratory.org.  I had previously made one (as mentioned in the text above) out of folded card-stock for my iPhone 4, which was a very useful exercise.  It helped me understand what would be desired in a new model, if nothing else.  Physical stability is pretty key, because otherwise, things shift too soon after calibration, which means the only thing you can reliably shoot is calibration shots =)

My new, more permanent spectrometer is housed in a (largely) light-tight electrical junction box.  I had to do cut away some of the inside features to provide a smooth surface on which to place and tape down the camera, but other than that, it was a good choice.  I used two of the existing pre-cut holes: one for the slit-opening and another for the USB cable.

For the slit, I used to box-cutting blades. To position them, I placed them facing each other, then placed two more blades stacked together between them for consistent spacing, then used tape to secure them in that configuration.  This works very well, and using tape to secure them to the box also allows me to adjust the rotational alignment with the camera once it was in-place.

I am currently using a piece of DVD-R for the diffraction grating.  I have a proper, 1000 lines/mm sheet coming, but it will take awhile to arrive due to my remoteness.  I understand from reading various articles on this site that the angle that the camera needs to be will change with the new diffraction grating, so I've put everything together with tape for now.  Also, the webcam I'm using is only 640x480 in resolution, if I see a cheap 720p or 1080p camera, I'll probably replace the one I'm using.

You may notice in the photos in the above article that I've used a toilet paper tube between the slit and the camera.  This is just to prevent any stray light from hitting the diffraction grating at the right angle to interfere with my readings.  My reasoning is that if another bright light source (other than the one I'm aiming for) is projected through the slit, it will quickly hit the tube wall–which is curved of course–and will quickly become deformed, absorbed and dispersed, probably a number of times before it gets near the diffraction grating.  Ideally, the inside of the tube would be matte black, but it already works well with its raw, unbleached paper color.  I will probably place a sheet of matte black paper inside the tube once I find some.  So far though, readings I've been making are pitch black except for the objective spectrums, so I don't know how important the black paper will be for now.  Another place I should place some black paper is on the bottom wall of the box where the camera is pointed to.  For my needs now, this isn't required, but if I were to ever try to take readings outside during daylight hours, this will probably become very important.

Another tip is that once I got everything mostly in-place, I setup PhotoBooth on my Mac to display the webcam's feed while I positioned everything.  This made it pretty easy to align everything and focus the camera to get the sharpest results. There is, unfortunately, a lot of "play" in the focus ring of this camera, so I taped it down once I found the best spot.

For the initial kombucha readings, I'm using my 750ml stopper bottles.  You can see them in the main photo of the article in the top-left.  Its not easy to tell here, but the bottles are actually squarish around the body.  This means that the opposite faces are parallel and this helped a lot with managing refraction.  I think the refraction index of the kombucha and sweet tea is different, because new alignement adjustments (the bottle vs. the light source vs. the spectrometer) had to be made between readings.  To be honest, I could probably forgo all of this spectrometry stuff and just focus on refraction index as an indicator of fermentation completeness! (The spectrometry stuff is more fun though =)

Anyway, my goal for daily readings is to do it in situ, meaning to take the reading through my 5 liter fermenting jars.  This is working, but its even more difficult to get the alignment correct because a) its round and b) there are raised bumps here and there for decoration =/.  I have worked up a design of a more ideal container for this and if I find a skilled glass blower, I may try it out =)

The idea would be that there is a "handle" which the fermenting liquid can pass through which has flat/parallel sides and is narrower to make the readings easier. This will also keep the mother from getting in the way =)

Anyway, good luck!
