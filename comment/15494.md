Hi Don, thanks for your awesome feedback! 

That notebook looks really cool. I wasn't aware of Jupyter and it looks like a great way to explain and visualize things.

I did not change SoftModem regarding the variable preamble. The current solution is to accept only preambles with a length of exactly 1 bit OR greater than 12 bits. This means that the preamble lengths 2-11 (times the length of one bit) can not be detected correctly.
I've experimented with a probabilistic approach to come around this and detect all possible preamble lengths SoftModem will generate, but it did not work out well.

Regarding errors: if you want error correction, I think Hamming is a feasible choice. As you already pointed out, doing this as a layer on top of the SoftModem transmission scheme is a good idea.

I see on github that you already did some CRC stuff, very cool!
