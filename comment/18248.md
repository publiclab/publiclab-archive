Copying in that discussion here, as it belongs here more appropriately:

Also thinking of making a kit -- here are individually packaged acetone wipes, although I don't know the concentration: https://www.amazon.com/Nail-Polish-Remover-Pads-Acetone/dp/B0775F6QT1/

If these work to clean the copper plates, they could make it much easier to make/send acetone with kits than sending bottles. 

I'm actually having some trouble finding small bottles of acetone nail polish remover... AliExpress also lists the wipes: https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=nail%20polish%20remover

[@bronwen](/profile/bronwen) - i had also thought of buying a larger bottle and separating it into smaller containers, but the fumes would have to be awful, no? I was thinking we might try out the wipes and compare/contrast the results to avoid that, but you're probably right that we could find a well ventilated area to do that in.
