Hi all, third answer here. 
Thanks for asking the question Gretchen, I actually have the same question. So this is not exact answer, I am hoping someone could correct me on this.
The drawing is my understanding of the difference between products(brands). I don't think KnowFlow is a datalogger. I hope to change the **arduino uno part** of knowflow to **Riffle**, since it's cheaper, smaller, easier to put into bottles, etc.  
concerning the code side, majority of KnowFlow's code is about control the sensors, I think can be used for other board as well.

[@rockets](/profile/rockets), what's your opinion?
