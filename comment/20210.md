Hi Warren, thanks for the link. I peeked a little bit into it already, but I don't speak JS, so it's a bit difficult for me not to get lost. I already found some useful functions though! I will check it out when I have more time.

Looked at MaggPi's notes, cool CV stuff! I will also take closer look soon.

Thank you!
