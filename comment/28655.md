Just noting a few more things here -- 

> There is no field in the Tag database table which keeps track of the user who has added that tag to some particular content. Because of this, it is not possible to delete by default the tags added by users who are banned.

Just to clarify, the `community_tags` table, known in the Rails model as `NodeTag`, has a uid field which shows who added this association between a tag and a node. So i think that'll be helpful!

> There is no way of preventing first time users from tagging work other than their own - this can lead to a lot of spam so restricting the tagging privileges of first time users is necessary.

I think this may be possible by screening at the same moment as we screen for other requirements, here: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/main/app/models/node.rb#L831

But maybe you're saying we don't /currently/ have a way but you expect to add one? that's fine! Thanks!
