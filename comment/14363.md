Well, except there's still a problem with the plot. The smallest increment looks to be '4 steps' per scale units of '10'. Either there was some multiplier involved in plotting or processing or there's some odd error.

As for the previous data with '2.55', I don't know how that relates to the source data -- which is 8-bit with the PLab camera -- so that camera can only be integer 0-255. Perhaps your source is something else?
