Paquicamus, there are a number of adapters that are available through Thingiverse to connect the Raspberry Pi camera to a stereo microscope, for instance: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:214466.   I don't have good ideas for if / how this would improve resolution or magnification, but it would at least get it into a digital format. 

We haven't done a lot of work on this part specifically, but it would be cool to try!
