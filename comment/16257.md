The Raspberry Pi mod would be very cool, especially as it presents opportunities to do un-corrected images (re: chris's above comments); several folks have posted about it:

https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/09-28-2016/upgrade-a-diy-spectrometer-with-a-raspberry-pi-camera

https://publiclab.org/questions/anjohn12/04-14-2016/question-getting-the-spectrometer-to-work-with-a-raspberry-pi

and a few have been built: https://publiclab.org/notes/cristoforetti/06-22-2016/webvalley-2016-improved-compact-spectrometer

I agree that this wiki page has some problems: https://publiclab.org/wiki/how-to-obtain-transmittance-absorbance-spectra

But I do think it can be labelled as such. Chris, if you think there are key errors with it, you should feel free to edit it or add comments/warnings. I'm also working hard on the [#rich-wikis](/tag/rich-wikis) project, which should allow us to do more interactive editing/suggesting/revising of wiki pages.

Do you mean a discussion of how to do comparisons without exposure compensation? I agree -- there are a few easier ways I think this could be done, and it'd be great to see an activity posted for them:

* non-exposure-adjusted cameras (as Chris outlines), either still cameras or via a Raspberry Pi
* two spectra in the same image (side by side comparison) so the exposure settings are the same

However, [@straylight](/profile/straylight) has posted an absorption activity that's listed on the spectrometry wiki page: https://publiclab.org/notes/straylight/05-13-2013/using-the-spectroscope-for-analysis-of-concentration-beer-s-law

Thanks [@nicholas](/profile/nicholas) and [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)!
