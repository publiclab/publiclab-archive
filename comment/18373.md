If I got it right, your photometer is measuring amount of light traveling through a solution or suspension. The loss of signal could be due to absorption of your red light, eg, by a green dye, or by scatter of light, induced by particles. To measure turbidity of non-colorless liquids, your may need to measure scatter typically done measuring the signal orthogonal to your path of light. That could work with your laser device. 
A suggestion: bakers yeast suspensions can be a very good, simple and cheap material to measure the scatter of practically colorless suspensions of tiny particles with a very well defined size. Just add a small amount of dry yeast to sugar water and incubate over night at room temperature. Fresh cultures should mostly consist of spherical living cells.

I had build some similar devices using comparable sensors, and my impression is that the brightness of your light source may be too high, resulting in saturation of the sensor. I would suggest to run the sensor at a maximum of 70% of its saturation volume.
