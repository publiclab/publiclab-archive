Thanks all! Looks like I'm late to some important comments. 

Thanks, [@warren](/profile/warren). I've updated the note per both of your requests. 

[@Odie91that](/profile/Odie91that)'s a great question and one that many people ask. I'm concerned that if we don't reverse the diaphragm we might risk suspending dust from the growth medium in the air (the pump has a small filter in it so sucked air would reduce that risk). But there are many reasons why you might want to let it stay as a pump: 1) it is safer to water (no risk of sucking water into the pump and ruining it if its  pumping air out) and 2) you can pull more HCHO into the system if you have a pump on the ground while the plant is in the window as HCHO is heavier than air. 

[@localman](/profile/localman) good questions and I'm sorry to hear about your situation. 1) I don't have any photos on hand but will make a note to take an image of that in the next build. It depends on the size of the plant but placing the tubing centrally (both vertically and horizontally) in the root ball is your best best. 2) again a good question you can see another (not very helpful) photo of it [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/nshapiro/08-02-2016/plant-air-remediation-field-test-2-georgia) here is a photo of another one where they used a pot that was probably too small:

I'm not sure I understand your third question! the air gets pulled down past the leaves and the roots and then through the airline and out of the pump itself. The pump is external to the planter which makes it more adaptable to whatever type of pot strikes your fancy and makes the whole setup much cheaper as there is not custom manufacturing.
