Hi Warren,

The Syhitech looks neat, especially for the price point, but I would like to see more peer-reviewed studies to confirm how well the sensor performs.

As for reading the Shineyi sensor, the process is more complicated than using digitalRead. The Arduino sketch and supporting documents in the GitHub repository should yield more information on how this all works.
