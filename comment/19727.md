I don't know how did I miss this great post!
A few pointers which are worthwhile noting:
* whenever you feel like you are missing something mechanical just look for it in Thingiverse! for example, see https://www.thingiverse.com/tag:Microscope/
* For anything that has to do with color, I like the CameraTrax 24 color card (14$ on Amazon)https://www.amazon.com/CameraTrax-24ColorCard-2x3-White-Balance-Guidebook/dp/B004QXU8VI
* In your leaf images the blue channel looked like it has some vignetting (the center is brighter than the edges).

Looking forward to see much more!
