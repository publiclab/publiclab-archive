The Fastie colormap was already implemented in infragram.org, so I can't take any credit there! 

What I am wondering is why there seems to be a shift in the NDVI between the MATLAB and infragram.org outputs. It looks as if the NDVI at infragram.org is a bit higher than the values which I calculated using your colormap. Hence the darker background and more green in the vegetated areas.

When calculating the NDVI, I had to convert uint8 to a double and then reclassify the images. In doing so, I tested both floor and ceiling functions, but the outputs were not shifted enough to change the output to match the infragram.org image. This is why I was wondering if the images were pre-processed with histogram stretching or normalization which may result in a bit wider range...
