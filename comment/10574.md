Great ! I am thinking on similar lines. 

You have a great CuSO4 calibration curve there. I work with aquaponics lab ion the incredible aquagarden.
We already have an automated pH measurement system and of course we use a calibration plot like yours for the pH electrode.

I am wondering how easy it would be to increase the accuracy of our water quality measurement processes 
for things like nitrates, KH, TH, and so on - all of which use test solutions that colour up with increasing concentrations.

Because they are different colours I may have to use a diffraction grating, which can be "set" to particular positions so as to use the appropriate wavelength for absorbance of each different solution. we are publishing our work of all types on Dozuki  : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nIL9hWW3-Q

Looking forward to next post!
