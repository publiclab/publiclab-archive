True, maybe a failed flush would just show the last version loaded.

`Network with Cache Fallback Policy` -- can you link to documentation about this? For example, I'm not sure if https://sequencer.publiclab.org follows this policy. Where is it established, and can you check if `image-sequencer` needs this to be switched on somehow? Thank you!!!
