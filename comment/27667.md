That time lapse animation is an excellent data visualization. This makes it clear that your setup was able to control some important variables. The circadian rhythm which you apparently captured is fascinating. 

You are asking the question Why did the non-watered plants have higher NDVI than watered plants? But your results confirmed that there were no statistically significant differences between those two treatments. So your experiment revealed that the NDVI of the non-watered plants was NOT higher than that of the watered plants.

It is probably not too surprising that NDVI did not reveal water stress before the plants wilted. A well-known feature of plant stress is that it does not quickly impact the spectral reflectivity of foliage in a way that would be captured by NDVI. One reason healthy foliage reflects less red than NIR is that chlorophyl absorbs more red than NIR. When a leaf wilts, the chlorophyl is still there and continues to absorb red (that’s what pigments do). A leaf severed from its branch can appear to be green for days because its chlorophyl will continue to absorb red light. It can be days or weeks after plant stress starts before that stress can be detected with NDVI. This has been demonstrated for agricultural crops and other vegetation types. Later, when the chlorophyl degrades, it will not absorb as much red and NDVI measures will respond. Also, as the cellular structure of the leaf changes the originally high reflectivity of NIR will diminish and NDVI values will drop.

There might be an explanation for the non-significant difference between the two treatments, but the difference is so slight that it could be due to many causes unrelated to the objective of your study. Searching for the cause might be unproductive because there are a few features of your setup that could produce artifacts. 

**A. Calibration or custom white balance? ** 
These are two separate techniques to adjust the brightness values (DNs) in the red and NIR channels so they can be proxies for the energy reflected from foliage. Only one of these techniques is required, although it appears that you tried to do both. It might have been better to capture RAW image files (no white balance adjustment) and adjust the DNs with a calibration procedure. I don’t know what your calibration procedure was, but it should have included spectral reflectance characterization of your three target materials at 647 nm and 843 nm. It should also have included an estimate of how much the red channel was contaminated with NIR light. Good values for these parameters are required for calibration.

**B. How much NIR does the camera capture? **
There are three variables impacting how much NIR the camera can record.

1. Relative intensity of LEDs. It would help to know the relative intensity of the LED illumination at 647 nm vs. 843 nm. When photos are taken, is most of the light red?

2. Spectral sensitivity of the camera. From the graph you include, we know the camera is less sensitive to NIR than to red light. 

3. NIR transmission of Rosco filter at 843nm. You correctly depict the transmission of the Rosco filter in the NIR region with a dashed line. I have never seen data on the NIR transmission of Rosco filters, so it appears that you don’t know how much of the 843 nm NIR passes through the Rosco filter and reaches the camera sensor. The filter could be blocking a large portion of the 843 nm NIR light.

Although plants in nature are bathed in about the same intensity of NIR as red light and healthy foliage reflects maybe three times more NIR than red, the amount of reflected NIR your camera was capturing  might have been just a fraction of the reflected red it was capturing. Another factor which will reduce the ratio of NIR:red is the contamination of the red channel with NIR. This inflates the measure of red light.

The calibration procedure could compensate for this diminished NIR:red ratio, and it is important that it be done correctly.

It seems that your results are in agreement with previous research. NDVI is generally not expected to reveal water stress before plants wilt. With all the variables that must be controlled in such an experiment it is an important accomplishment to get the result you did.
