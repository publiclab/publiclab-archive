I've got some new idea to improve the bamboo kite and make it more lighter. Infact the sparless single skin kite (parachute kite) inspired me so we can use a thin bamboo to reduce the weight instead of using a thicker one and put some strings in different place along the spars like in <a href="https://publiclab.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/big_but_downloadable/7488878872_ce8389c3ee_c.jpg">the parachute kite</a> to make it more stiff when the wind blow. This combination will prevent the kite from collapsing if the wind changes direction suddenly.
