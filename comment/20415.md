Hi [@liz](/profile/liz) -- Cool. The aggregate page (for lack of a better word) is super helpful! Seeing all the related content / questions now and will check those out. 

I'm also just seeing that you posted a couple tips above for me to incorporate into my wiki. Sorry for missing those. I added them as tags, and see questions now appearing on top. Is that what you were suggesting? Or do i put it in the content of the wiki itself. (Or does the new page you created obviate this suggestion?)
