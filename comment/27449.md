Sounds like a neat project! For the first part of your question, are there specific compounds in food waste that you're interested in detecting? 

If you haven't seen it yet, this post and its comments might provide some ideas: [Refractometer for measuring nutrient density in food](https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/6-7-2011/refractometer-measuring-nutrient-density). The external link in the post leads to a page that no longer exists, but I believe [this link ](https://bionutrient.org/site/bionutrient-rich-food/brix)has the same information.

And this post contains some spectra from food: [Several new spectra from food samples](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/9-3-2011/several-new-spectra-food-samples)
