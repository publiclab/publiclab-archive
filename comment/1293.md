Hi, ToF - wow, cool! Is your resolution an estimate based on the geometry and grating? Or have you built one?

Very cool. I've been trying to design one to fit inside this box, which can then be built into a larger pipe-based structure, including a lamp and such:

It's nice because it's completely light-sealed and rigid.
