 That is a fair point.  Not sure why I didn't think of that.  Thanks.  I also made a few mods to my build.  I extended the main housing to add a small compartment for the ribbon cable as well as a few flat pieces to cover said compartment allowing the space of 1 flat brick for the cable leading to the Raspberry Pi.  I also added a 2x4 flat tile to the bottom of the Raspberry Pi with a hot glue gun, to that it can mount to the housing.
