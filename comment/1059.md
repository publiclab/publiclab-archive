<strong>Notes on Building a Monopod/Tripod for the Touchtable:</strong>
My favorite mono/tripod set up is now:
1.	<a href="http://www.rocketfishproducts.com/products/cameras-camcorders/RF-MONO70C.html">Rocektfish RF-MONO70C</a> -- carbon fiber light and sturdy, attachments at head are most versatile. If you mount the camera mount plate onto your projector, attaching the projector to the tripod becomes really easy.
2.	<a href="http://www.adorama.com/SU9002TM.html">SUNPAK 9002TM</a> -- short enough to fit in a carry on suitcase, sturdy enough to hold the monopod.

How to adapt for holding projector: 
1.	Cut a 4 inch portion of the 9002TM monopod tube with a copper pipe cutter, 
2.	Shave off enough of the rubber tip of the monopod for the pipe to fit over the end 
3.	Stuff epoxy puddy into the pipe around the monopod rod so that pipe is securely attached to the monopod.
 
Note: we have no connection to Rocketfish, SUNPAK, or any of the vendors links I provide above. If you're going to buy any of these products, search around for the best deals.
