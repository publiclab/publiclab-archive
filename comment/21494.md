Hi Emiel-  Are you able to recognize the USB webcams in your built-in photo software? Without knowing much about your operating system, we've found that tablets and phones aren't always set up to connect to an external camera, so you may need to get in to your settings to get it to recognize the device. If you ARE able to connect to the webcam through your tablet's built-in photo program is but still aren't able to connect directly to Spectral Workbench, you can still upload your images without a direct connection, but you can also file a bug report (look at the bottom of the page for the GitHub link) with some more information about your issue and we can follow up from the software side.
