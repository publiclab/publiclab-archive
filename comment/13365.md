The combination of the cardboard with both creases and the to-go container looks pretty protective. I like the fact that the splay of the four legs tends to prevent the cardboard from sliding down because the legs get farther apart. It looks like you replaced the rubber bands holding the four legs at the top with a single black rubber O-ring which looks nice and strong. That's tidy.
