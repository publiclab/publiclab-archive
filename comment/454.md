hard to say - in some areas you can see it chose a blurry image, so I could have gone in and chosen only non-blurry images to improve the results. and based on the # of "corners" around the edge of the image, it looks like it used a lot. I imagine it has to do the hard work just to see where an image fits, and once it's done that it's not a big deal to reproject the image onto the model, so it probably does that rather than try and figure out which ones to use.
