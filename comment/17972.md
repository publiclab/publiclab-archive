Yes, in a professional capacity. In the DIY space not so much.

To keep it simple and cost effective I might suggest sticking with Activated Carbon. AC is a widely used, effective adsorbent. There is lots of available information from product manufacturers and academic sources related to the efficacy of AC adsorbents for various contaminants.

Many 'off the shelf' carbon products would have fair adsorption capacities for the contaminants you are concerned about. This is a technique you could easily employ today to improve indoor air quality while simultaneously experimenting with design/adsorbents to improve efficiency in the future, based on site specific requirements.

As for a Biofiltering device, it would require a higher degree of sophistication and cost to make it effective in this application. I would suggest taking a scrubber based design approach. If you are still interested I'd be happy to chat about that idea further or help with an adsorbent based approach. Cheers.
