The Bayer filter is frustrating, but if we can figure it out, it might be a hidden plus for us; in some ways, the R, G, and B channels can be treated as 3 different exposures in a high dynamic range (HDR) image of the spectrum. If we can come up with a standard way to consistently combine the bands, we could deal with low exposure and overexposure as long as at least one of the bands has a good response.

Tom, i think you found a bug in SW's data export. I'm assuming it's a rounding error, perhaps when intensity data is being converted from a float to an int before being summed in all 3 channels. I suppose I should fix that :-P
