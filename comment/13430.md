Parth,

Most photos taken by DIY NDVI cameras cannot be converted directly to NDVI because the ratio of the visible and NIR values does not compute to proper NDVI values. Generally, the NDVI values are too low because the visible and NIR values are too similar. One easy way to shift the NDVI values into the proper range is to add a constant to all of them. The constants I added to make your NDVI images are numbers I made up so the NDVI results would look good to me. They are fudge factors. A better way to adjust the NDVI values is to adjust the visible and NIR values before computing NDVI using the calibration method Ned is working on: https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/07-22-2015/introducing-the-calibration-plugin-for-imagej-fiji.  I don't know of other software that can do this.

The constants I added are different at infragram.org and with Fiji. With Fiji, the NDVI values are scaled between 0 and 255 (I added 12). At infragram.org, I guess the NDVI values are scaled between -1 and +1 (I added 0.09).
