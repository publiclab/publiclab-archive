If you are using Gc/ms, there are two common type detectors, quad detectors and ion trap detectors.  I'm partial to quads.  But I've had salesman tell me how wrong I am for years.   If you are using a Gc/ms, it really helps to have a library, rather than to work the spectra down by hand.  But either is possible.  And it is pretty easy to mess u p the detector after a few messy runs so you have to shut the instrument down, clean it out, pump down, and start over ( usually, at least a day 's time).  The technique is very powerful, but can also be very time consuming. And that is beyond the sample prep!
