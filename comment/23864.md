I was just reading on the pi website [about the rolling shutter](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/fov.html) and I was wrong about the global shutter (it said only cameras with physical shutters can use a global shutter mode). I think we are stuck with rolling shutter and just have to think of ways to overcome the resulting noise.
