This one is difficult.  Carbon dioxide isn't transported through pipelines as a gas.  Instead, they are talking about sending it through as a supercritical fluid.  It means the lines need to be higher pressure than normal ( i.e. new) and may lead to new dangers. And yes, line breaks will be an issue.
