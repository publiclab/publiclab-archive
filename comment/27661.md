Hi! can you tell us what browser version number you're using? And, if you've used this site before, can you try clicking the `Clear offline cache` button at the bottom of the page, or using it in Incognito mode? I've just tried the steps you mentioned but wasn't able to see an error; but maybe it has to do with your browser versions?

Thank you!
