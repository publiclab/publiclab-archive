Yes, you are right. I, too, like comparable curves better. I used LibreOffice, a kind of public domain "Excel". It plots diagrams automatically and chooses the heights as is best for each curve. To get the same Y scale I would have to combine curves in one diagram, I guess. Or do you know of any program that does statistics and visualisations better? (automatic feed-in of CSV files included)
