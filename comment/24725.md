 So far I'm also favoring a combo method. I think most people like the idea of small tasks they can work on since this is a volunteer community. The tough part will be accountability. So [@Stevie](/profile/Stevie), what you said about a regular check-in makes sense. I know for GOSH someone is in charge of sending out reminders, which so far seems to be working.
