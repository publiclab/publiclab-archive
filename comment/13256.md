Just a note that I found this interesting article (not peer-reviewed; Photonics is an industry trade journal, I think) which discusses LED input light:

http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=47915

> The UV probe fired a xenon flashlamp at 254 nm, and the visible-range device used an LED to provide excitation at 370 to 460 nm. The researchers tested the probes using phenanthrene as the key standard to help determine the concentration of diesel fuel, gasoline, gear oil and motor oil in a water sample.
> They found that the LED-based probe did not respond at all to the diesel fuel, whereas the UV sensor picked out diesel at less than 1 mg/l and was sensitive to all of the other potential pollutants as well. 

So, the LED we're using is close to what they're calling a "visible-range device." More:

> In a paper published in Power Plant Chemistry in 2010, Malkov and his colleague, Dietmar Sievert, also of Hach Co., focused their attention on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They set out to show how well UV fluorescence would provide a correlation between oil concentration and the sensor readings they acquired. They compared the results of the UV probe with those from a device using visible wavelengths.

> “The biggest challenges [are] that UV sensors are too specific to PAH and therefore won’t see natural oils in water, while [visible] sensors are not specific enough and will suffer from interference provided by natural organic matter in water,” Malkov said.

So, it sounds like whether we continue to use a 405nm laser or a 405nm LED, we really do have to take organic matter seriously, as we'd expected, as a false positive.
