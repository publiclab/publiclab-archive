The Mini Pearl Logger in the compost pile stopped logging today when the battery voltage dropped too low. Four AAA eneloops ran the logger for 13.5 days. The logger was reading three MCP9808 sensors and one BME280 sensor and saving to microSD card every ten minutes. Almost 2000 logging events were recorded.

*Above: Temperature data from a Mini Pearl Logger in a compost pile. Two MCP9808 sensors were near the center of the pile and close together for the first week, and then about 6" apart. The pile was turned at the beginning and again after the first week. Some winter rye and vetch were added during the first turning, and fresh weeds and grass clippings were added during the second turning. The weeds and grass clippings apparently supplied a lot more nitrogen and supported a lot more bacterial activity.*

I measured the sleep current when I brought the logger inside (Table 1). It should be possible to get the sleep current of this logger as low as 0.25mA, although different sensors apparently add different amounts to this current. So the 2.3mA I measured is not a great result. I am still not sure what to try next to reduce the power draw. I was hoping to avoid the more esoteric measures like storing the data in a memory buffer for several days to reduce the number of times data has to be written to the SD card (waking up the SD card uses lots of power). But I might be running out of options.
