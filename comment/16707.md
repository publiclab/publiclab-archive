It's a big project, and we'd like to identify smaller subsets to use as "pilot" exporatory initial projects that can be completed quickly so we can see how one possible implementation of the system works, then iterate/expand. I know it's tempting to build the whole architecture first, but if there is a narrower subset of the infrastructure we can build first, to better understand through a pilot bot, I think that'll be worthwhile. What do you think?
