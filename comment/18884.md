Great -- thank you!!! I think you're right there is not a Rails 5 issue. Perhaps we're waiting until the Rails 4.2 one is complete! I do like how thoroughly you've plotted out the needed changes. Are you comfortable rebasing code often? Because in a project this big, you'll unfortunately have to do so pretty regularly as other people submit code before you've completed the changes -- it's a tough one!

A good read over this may help -- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing

and our testing will help a lot. But this is one reason we're trying to do as much as we can ahead of time before committing to the Rails 5 change so that the moment of change-over is as short as possible, you know? 

Thank you!!!
