While I agree that many professional scientists are not explicitly considering the needs and motivations of citizen science contributors, I take some issue with your characterization of citizen science.  Much data collection is simple and often tedious, whether it is performed by professional scientists or citizen scientists.  Part of this is just the nature of the beast and part of it is by design because in order to standardize data collection and analysis, activities must be easily repeatable so that sampling/observer biases are limited.  This concept applies regardless of who is collecting the data, and I have seen many a professional scientist perform repetitive, simple tasks because it is necessary to answer the questions that they have posed.  None of this should detract from the fact that it is important to involve communities in the decisions that impact them, nor does it take away from the value of data and research questions that come from the DIY community.  Citizen science can and should find ways to be more inclusive and less top down, but no matter who is involved, there will always be simple, repetitive tasks to perform when it comes to collecting and processing data.
