:-/ unfortunately it's not a feature we have right now, but we are interested in figuring out how to do it without causing trouble in the database. We may need to think about assigning non-existent content to a "deleted user account" perhaps... or, somehow having a "deleted user state" which we assign a user record after scrubbing relevant details from its database record...&nbsp;
  

Another thing we could try is "Merge users" -- would that help here?
