Thanks. I'm also in a Learning Curve. But according to what I understand 0.1-0.6 is very green. Plants/vegetation is between 0.2 to 0.8. I might be wrong. Please someone correct if I am
I'm busy with some updates, where you can add your own ndvi Color chart, depending of the type of convertion used. I mostly use Fiji-App, with physics and NDVIblu2red.lut files.

Something to Note: if the color Bar don't move when on the NDVI image, edit the ini File as follows
1. Put the cursor in the middle of the NDVI color Bar at the bottom
2. Note the MouseY position eg: 507
3. edit the settings.ini file
4. Change the ypos= to the value on your monitor
5. save the file and try again. 
I'm in the process of automate this, hopefully the next version will check screen size and resolution and do this automatically.
