Guillaume,

That was a great idea to allow adjustments to the angle of the slit and grating. You should be able to find positions that produce very good spectra. I found that adjusting the [distance between the slit and grating](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/2-5-2013/grating-angle) also made a difference, but I never learned why.

The 1952 paper by that WG Fastie fellow describes how a precisely curved entrance slit in an Ebert spectrometer can eliminate astigmatism in the spectral lines. So it is not about curved spectral lines, but nonetheless a notable contribution.
