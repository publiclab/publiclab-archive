Hi wmacfarl,
Some more info.

This type of sensor does not measure turbidity exactly.

It measures the absorbance, or attenuation of light when passing through the sample.

To measure turbidity the detector must be at an angle of 90 degrees to the source.

In turbidity what is measured is the light scattered by the particles, or microbubbles, suspended in the sample.

When the detector is aligned with the light source what is being measured is the aborbance, ie the attenuation in the light signal.

And aborbance (attenuation in light intensity) is the combined (summation) result of light that has been absorbed by the dissolved substances + the light that has been scattered by the particles that are in suspension.

Best regards,
Markos
