Dear FrankA, 
Greetings from Nepal, 
I have a mobius actioncam ( Green Blue and Near Infrared )  which is modified to take near infrared spectrum for plant health analysis NDVI...i have attached it (facing vertically downward as shown in attached image) to a drone (DJI Phantom 3 Professional) for aerial mapping and plant health analysis. I took multiple images in time lapse of every 1 second...but the images are very much distorted (due to vibration, fish eye effect, some other distortions ) is there any ways to correct those distortions  caused due to fast moving drone? My plan is to use Agisoft Photoscan to stich those multiple images and create an orthomosaic and run NDVI algorithm for plant health analysis.....but i am stuck with these distortions.i saw the photo of your drone, i wanted to ask did you add anything for controlling vibration effect of drone on the camera? I am impressed with your results. suggest me what should i do to get better image acquisition for NDVI calculation.

Thanks in advance
Regards,
Suman
