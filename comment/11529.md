I'm still working on the software part to add functionality, as suggested in the note. 

As it is currently set up, the script now uploads images to my ftp server, unless there is not connection. The no connection situation is not ideal, and would require the addition of a hardware clock to keep accurate time.

There is a live feed of the images, better the last image is saved in the home directory. In my latest install script (untested) I will install a http server on the pi. This would allow you to browse to your pi and look at what the camera was seeing during the last snapshot.

There is also no reason why concurrent services couldn't be run if the handoff of the camera is done properly, hence my suggestion to stream the data as a security service in addition to having it record at an interval.

An STL file can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/em69on4z0umzici/phenopi.stl?dl=0), but I'm not sure if this will hold up. The 3mm plywood is rigid enough but I'm not sure how the plastics compare.
