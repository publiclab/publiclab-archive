Also noting the amazing work of the Brown Superfund Research Program, which we helped to create the "Unearthing Providence" site here:

https://publiclab.org/unearthing-pvd

They have bulk-scanned municipal business records since the early 1950s for the entire state of Rhode Island and digitized and mapped all entries. There's a wealth of information on metalworking and other manufacturing activities for many many addresses. I believe they're hoping to repeat this for all 50 states, over time.
