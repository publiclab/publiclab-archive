If you shop on the commercial sites, there are claims that their kits ( for a variety of tests) will cover soil even though the kits are designed for water.  Talk to the company reps to get more information- like methods used, validation procedures, etc.  Just the mention in the sales line throws a bit of a red flag.  Usually, the soil testing is much more involved, with additional filtration steps, sometimes ashing steps, etc. But there could be some that can do it.  Please, just be skeptical and cover your bases.  Regards.
