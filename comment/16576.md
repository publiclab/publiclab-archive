I'm using thingspeak to post my data online as Xively is not free anymore or at least you can't use free account to post all this data online.

I've got one question though - if P1 channel is for counting particles 1-10 microns then why do you count PM 10 from channel P2? In your code:

`float PM10count = countP2;`
`float PM25count = countP1 - countP2;`
