Okay, my sunlight did not show much UV because I let it  shine through a glass window. Next time I will try without the glass. (Waiting for the next sunny day...) Not sure if that standard PLab-kit-camera can even detect UV... But that leads me to the next question: you seem to use a UV-Laser in some of your experiments. Is it right that it only uses a single UV-wavelength? That seems to mean that you only can explore matter that absorbs exactly THAT wavelength (and emitts perhaps a different one)? Is that right? What about "the other waves"?
