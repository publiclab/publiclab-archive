Hi [@ngobirifalyne00](/profile/ngobirifalyne00), thank you for working on this. You mentioned adding a help button that will contain possible help solutions to users incase they get stuck. Will this help button display a modal or menu? What content will it contain?

Do you have any plans for a responsive design? I'm curious to see what the site would look like on smaller/medium screens. I'd also like to know how you plan on implementing the cross-browser drag and drop feature. Do you have any libraries in mind? Code snippets would also be very helpful.

Also, will the left and right sidebars have menus to hide/show the contents? Thank you!!
