So, today I wrote an OPK driver using the [Firmata](https://github.com/jgautier/firmata) Node library to access an Arduino over the [Firmata firmware](http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page), but we discovered that the Shinyei needs us to work fast enough (if we're understanding properly) to actually measure individual particles passing the sensor -- which can take 10-90ms. Node and the USB interface just can't work fast enough, as we understand it -- I was getting notices that even a 10ms interval was not completing digitalReads fast enough. 

So we're going to switch back to doing it on the Arduino, and my driver will adapt to just reading the sums reported by the Arduino. 

**BUT!** ([@rjstatic](/profile/rjstatic) and [@donblair](/profile/donblair) - this may be of interest) This driver (https://github.com/jywarren/opk-shinyei-ppd42-cli) is a great example on which to base a generalized Firmata/Arduino driver. Basically, if you can plug a sensor into an Arduino (say, a $9 Arduino-compatible Digispark), you'd be able to connect it to Open Pipe Kit. Some more flags to the command line interface can let us specify which pins to poll. 

It won't work for superfast sensors like the Shinyei -- the latency requirements are too great -- but for many many other sensors, this works great.
