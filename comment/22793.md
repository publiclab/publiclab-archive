Great notes on choosing different copper pipes (apparently there's red copper and blue copper?) by [@sara](/profile/sara) on this post: 

https://publiclab.org/notes/sara/5-2-2012/materials-copper-pipe-work

Also a good discussion of whether adhesive copper foil could work, or if it'd interact with the acetone badly, with [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) and [@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2):
