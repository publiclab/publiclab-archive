Great notes on choosing different copper pipes (apparently there's red copper and blue copper?) by [@sara](/profile/sara) on this post:

Also a good discussion of whether adhesive copper foil could work, or if it'd interact with the acetone badly, with [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) and [@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2):
