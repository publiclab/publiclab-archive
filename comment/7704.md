For some reason it's hard to find spectra of glow-in-the-dark pigments. Really, a thousand Public Lab spectrometers out there and no one has done this? Here are three bright green pigments from [LumiNova](http://www.nemoto.co.jp/en/products/luminova/pdf/Luminova-G.pdf):

Maybe other pigments have narrower bands and sharper peaks for wavelength calibration,  but maybe not.  It would be cool to charge up a patch of this paint with a UV LED and then immediately use the emission glow to calibrate spectrometer intensity.  Maybe a thin line could be painted inside and parallel to the entrance slit so it was captured in every spectrum. Maybe an internal UV LED could be on all the time since it would not show up in the visible or IR spectrum. But unless some glow-in-the-dark pigments have much narrower peaks, the emission would overlay the sample spectrum. So the pigment line would have to extend the line of the entrance slit instead of being parallel to it so its emission spectrum was separate from the sample spectrum.
