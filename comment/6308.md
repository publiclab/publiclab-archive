Wow. Is this continuous forest? It sounds like you are going to launch the balloon through a few different canopy gaps to get coverage of each plot. Or are there towers at these plots? The balloon will have to be well above the canopy (including the emergent trees)  to capture a good portion of the plot, so you will need lots of line. I guess if the wind speed above the canopy is anything other than zero, it will be very hard to get the balloon back down through a gap. The Public Lab balloon kit neoprene balloon is not very good at rubbing against things like twigs without popping. This is going to be an exciting expedition.
