Well, one reason to beamsplit and recombine on one camera is to save the cost of a camera... it'd be really awesome to have an entire camera for well under $100 retail, which means parts have to come in well under $50 (or nobody will distribute it). So although the 50% mirror is a good idea, if we could just add one more mirror, we can halve the cost of webcams. 

50% mirrors, well placed, could displace a beamsplitter, but at what cost? Someone suggested 50% metallized mylar film, which is a good idea, but harder to construct. I guess we'd like to do a proof of concept with a real beamsplitter before trying to DIY the beamsplitter itself... one step at a time! :-)
