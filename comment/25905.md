Hey, I have a couple of questions that may help to look at the hardware side:

* Did you use a phone cable for the USB or is it a legit cable used for microcontrollers (have run into problems pretty frequently if it's a phone cable)

* The wires that join to the switch--are they soldered or just wrapped around? They would definitely need to be soldered for a good connection.

* The blue/red/black wires that you have that join--are the red and black in the correct position so they match the ones you are joining? (Yeah, obvious but worth a check :))

* Did you solder the header onto the Arduino (the pins that go into the breadboard) or did it come pre-soldered?

That's it for now. It may be good to post pics of your boards/connections--kind of hard to tell by the gifs. All in all things look good from what you have posted. :)
