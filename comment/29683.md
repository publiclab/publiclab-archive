Journal Entry 1:

I found a plastic candy wrapper on the road. I was a snickers candy wrapper. I can assume that it was used to wrap the candy bar. I can infer that the wrapper was created in an industry setting at a Mars Inc. industrial location. It has been used  for one purpose, to wrap the candy bar for effective transportation and protection from outside contaminants. In the industrial building it was used to package the product. In the store it was bought by a consumer and was used by that consumer to keep their candy bar in pristine condition until they wanted to eat the snickers bar. Once they ate the snickers bar they failed to throw it away in a trash can. They instead threw it out of their car door while riding down the street or simply dropped it. The reason it is not effectively disposed of is because the consumer isn't aware or convicted of the damage they can cause. I believe that it was not recycled because the dangers of plastic and microplastic pollution are not taken seriously in the world around us.
