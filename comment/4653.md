[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) Thank you for the comment, and we do agree that it was quite an interesting project, and we very much appreciate the link to the spectra. Looking at our fluorescent DVD (yellow) spectra we can see some similarities between the two, especially the two tall signals, which in comparison to the spectra provided via wikipedia I am assuming that they are terbium/mercury and eropium. This is quite interesting since we knew the fluorescent DVD experiment worked out better comparing to all the other experiments, but we did not anticipate the spectra to have such clear similarities with the one online. I am not quite sure what you mean by there not being a source of much light in a fluorescent lamp, can you elaborate on that? 

thanks again for the comment
