sounds like you are following the FAA guidelines for 101.17: http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=e29bc663738a4224a2112f8a1a8279a9&rgn=div5&view=text&node=14:2.0.1.3.15&idno=14#14:2.0.1.3.15.2.9.4

§ 101.17   Lighting and marking requirements.
(a) No person may operate a moored balloon or kite, between sunset and sunrise unless the balloon or kite, and its mooring lines, are lighted so as to give a visual warning equal to that required for obstructions to air navigation in the FAA publication “Obstruction Marking and Lighting”.

(b) No person may operate a moored balloon or kite between sunrise and sunset unless its mooring lines have colored pennants or streamers attached at not more than 50 foot intervals beginning at 150 feet above the surface of the earth and visible for at least one mile.

(Sec. 6(c), Department of Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 1655(c)))
