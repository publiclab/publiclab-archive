No worries - if you can travel north a bit you should consider coming to the New England barnraising the weekend of June 5th -- http://publiclab.org/wiki/barnraising-northeast-2014 -- We are going to be focusing on water quality issues and there will be Riffles to play with plus a community of people to brainstorm with
