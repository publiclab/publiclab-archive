Yes, I think up to the present, it was hard to see past all the spectacle with something like VR and much remains to be explored before its insights are well understood. 
  Part of the appeal of grassroots mapping for example, is that even solo flights wind up being a very social activity. Whether it be a kite/balloon w/ camera rig or a drone, in most cases it also doubles as a giant banner reading "HEY EVERYBODY ASK ME WHAT I'M DOING!" (whether or not you actually feel like talking to other people...)  Moreover, the medium of aerial mapping is about broadening horizons in the most literal sense.
  Virtual reality on the other hand is somewhat of a paradox.  From the perspective of the individual, it can certainly feel like a broadening of horizons, but from a social point of view, the sight of someone blindly flailing around with a headset over their eyes looks ridiculous at best and myopic at worst!  
  I think you hit upon one possible way it could work however in the example you gave earlier. If used within the live planning session itself, VR would only serve to isolate individuals from the interactions around them.  BUT if used remotely, it allows people to become active participants when they would normally be isolated.
  Ultimately then, the question comes down to how much interaction is actually enabled by VR.  Or whether it is simply just another medium intended for passive consumption.  My own feeling is that the latter description may well apply to everything between "The Lawnmower Man" and the Oculus Rift, but the jury is still out in regards to the pseudo-DIY "Cardboard VR" platform.  Even if it I take the cynical view that its just another gimmick on the part of Google to promote Youtube, it would still involve a medium based on user-generated content.
  In any case, it will be interesting to come back to this thread in three years time and reflect on whether this was all just wishful thinking or if there really is a new medium emerging!
