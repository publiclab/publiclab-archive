I also wanted to [link back to this idea](https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/04-14-2016/spectrometer-stability#c14264) of monitoring the green peaks over a period of time: 

> As to how to measure this, I'd suggest a real-time display of say a green peak from a stable lamp where the display is a live 3-5 point running average of that peak's value, plotted not to show the absolute value, but the difference from the 'norm' so as to observe drift. The analogy is an oscilloscope. Then, handle the device and watch for correlations between the mechanical and the signal change -- which should be rock solid relative to the mechanical mounting of the optical components and the USB cable.
