Hi [@priya17081](/profile/priya17081), thank you for your proposal! 

https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/pull/183/files shows you have a real knack for careful and supportive documentation -- and the details that make it work smoothly! Thank you for such a great contribution! There's nothing like a great, simple, readable, thorough (and correct!) README, huh? üëç 

I like your idea for nested layers listing -- have you seen some Leaflet plugins that do something like this? Or potentially some other UI libraries we could use to achieve it? 

Finally, I recommend you look at a selection of our different Leaflet-based libraries to think about what "ingredients" make up a small, well-documented library. For example, a good README. But also -- tests, docs on how to run them, continuous integration via (for example) https://travis-ci.com, a clear structure in `/src/` files, files that aren't too long to read, and more. Not all of these have this but compare them to see what is easiest to read and (you imagine) to build on top of:

* https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/
* https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location
* https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-multispectral
* https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location

And just for comparison, some non-Leaflet ones:

* https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor
* https://github.com/publiclab/inline-markdown-editor

Thank you again for your proposal!!!
