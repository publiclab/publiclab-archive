For plain text only, we might want to look into something like what TwitLonger does.
http://www.twitlonger.com/

Twitter begins as just text with 140 characters. TwitLonger breaks the 140 character limit and supports line breaks, but that's about it. It's just text and links.

Since Twitter is accessible, tons of people already use it. I wonder if we could make a way to generate a research note for a user if they send a TwitLonger link to `@ publiclab` on twitter? Then research notes could be written using someone's favorite long tweet supporting app.
