i noticed two formatting issues. There seems to be a missing research note in the section:
>If you are unsure of whether or not this method may be of use to you please see two additional research notes:  
[Thoughts on Method 9 and its Utility](https://publiclab.org/notes/gretchengehrke/10-28-2016/thoughts-on-method-9-and-its-utility) and

also, the numbers' sequence is being re-set by Markdown, so when you reference a number it isn't quite showing up.
