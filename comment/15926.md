The divider is definitely an interesting idea. I've been looking around and maybe I could use two tools: A lux meter for brightness, and the spectrometer for color. Would that make sense?

That way I'm always sure the lux meter is an absolute value. I'm just not sure if the spectrometer would be an absolute value. I might need to move it closer/further from the source depending if the light is too bright for the spectrometer's webcam.
