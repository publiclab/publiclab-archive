It's been awhile since I did any hydrologic mapping, but I think you can use <5m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) LiDAR data to predict where stream flow will occur. The ephemeral nature of the streams means you'll need timely aerial imagery (kites, maybe?), to check it against and certainly field validation. Have you talked to the folks at Humanitarian Openstreet Map? This sounds right up their alley and they have access to imagery and volunteers who are interested in this specific type of mapping work.
