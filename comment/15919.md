neat.  maybe put the fan on the charcoal side and blow into the tube so you don't get infiltration from the flap in the middle?

The other way I've seen this done is with activated charcoal from a pet store (used for aquariums).   You can also buy cheap air pumps and the cotton like filter fabric at pet store cheaply as well.  Blow air into container with charcoal and then through filter and into chamber (cheap plastic fish bowl) with sensor.  

For a container, I've used 1 ft sections of 1" tubing or pvc pipe.  fill with charcoal, put fabric on the ends then thread in some tube connectors--just jam them inside the tube and screw in.
