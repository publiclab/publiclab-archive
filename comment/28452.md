I can't tell you about the current regulations. Sorry.  But the rule of thumb with tethered balloons was to put a weak link in the line at the balloon.  That was along with the standard rule of not flying a balloon where the tether  lines can fall in power lines. There are many stories of the lines for the balloons breaking off and tangling in power lines.  Needless to say, the power companies were less than happy at the damage.
