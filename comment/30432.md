Environmental science is an interdisciplinary field of study that includes biology related to biotic, abiotic, soil, water, air, public health and safety, and environmental stabilization. Environmental science research plays a decisive role in the viability of  people and the environment, as our coexistence is conditional. It is very important that we care, understand and manage our environment as we have a responsibility to ensure stability for present and future generations.
