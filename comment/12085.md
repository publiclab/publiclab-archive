Just ran my first test! Thanks for these great instructions! I would add a couple things to the instructions: 

* As the power cord is less than a meter, please plan ahead to identify nearby electrical outlets and carry an extension cord if needed. (Future versions may include a battery pack!)
* The case will vibrate while the pump is running, watchout if you've placed it on a table or elevated surface where it could work itself right off the edge. Also, the vibration creates just a bit of background noise. 

And a note for making the temperature conversion sheet better:

* Include one sentence -- in big font -- how to convert PPM to PPB (by moving the decimal 3 places). Yes, we have to include this. 
* Below that, print wording to give some context for the numerical reading that this tool gives the user. Perhaps existing workspace regulations and research linking formaldehyde exposure (acute or chronic) to health symptoms, and explain that there are no regulations on home environments. Or however this should be worded. 

Generally, it would be cool to understand more about how the Kitagawa 710 Formaldehyde tubes work. Is there a good note about that somewhere?
