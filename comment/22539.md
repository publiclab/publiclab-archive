Hi [@Braunlkg](/profile/Braunlkg)! My first thought was: no. But It looks like maybe is possible ;) I attach you here some links. Related to going from rpi2 to rpi3 or from rpiB+ to RPi2B

And a more general question

As I understand after a fast net research the important step is doing an update/upgrade before moving from origin to destination.

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade

Before trying i'd make a copy of your sd card using the "dd" command or the "SD card copier" built in raspbian
