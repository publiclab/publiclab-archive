It would be truly fantastic to have such a system for capturing data from environmental monitors -- air quality, water quality -- with the idea that you could choose to store the data locally, or additionally broadcast it and store it remotely. I love that it's designed to be a sort of minimalist setup, with a collection of optional modules, and that it's based on the accessible, hugely popular RPi platform. Really eager to brainstorm about next steps.
