Hi [@aquilies](/profile/aquilies) just to add what [@asnow](/profile/asnow) said, we've been stacking the amscope lenses with Raspberry Pi cameras, which has worked well, but this is a new/evolving project, so I am sure as more people start to build their own microscopes we'll have more to share about the pros/cons of different types of lenses. You might also be interested in [@MaggPi](/profile/MaggPi) 's work using the [microscope with modifications for infrared](https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/06-21-2018/infrared-insect-microscopy). The basic microscope actually uses an inverted webcam lens without an additional objective lens, with some impressive results.  

I'd be interested to hear more about your work, do you have links to your project anywhere?
