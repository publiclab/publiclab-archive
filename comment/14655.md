Hi Gretchen,

I also wondered whether the change in logging frequency was caused by the Riffle dropping below 0°C. There is more about that possibility in the [response to this note](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/05-19-2016/frozen-riffle). That note has a table of the part of the logged data which records the temperature dropping to 0°C. The tables above are just examples of the pattern before and after the shift in logging pattern. There are 400 logged data points in the entire file.

This calls for another Riffle to be tested by being put into the freezer while logging, and also when the time is 10:00:00 (AM or PM).
