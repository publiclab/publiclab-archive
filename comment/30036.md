Hello [@mittalparth22](/profile/mittalparth22)! Thank you for your proposal. I like your systematic approach to planning these navigational changes. From the backend possibilities you diagram, I have a preference for the one where you extend the tag relation with a URL field, which we could then read from the tag pages (/tag/____) to try a range of front-end options. I like both the "extra tab" and the idea of something hovering on the page, like perhaps to the upper right, or at the bottom. 

For the randomizer, i like how you've proposed model and helper functions to modularize the code. And I like your suggestions for UI placement. Could you incorporate a user feedback stage to present these options to community members for input?

For the Navbar search box improvements, I wonder if instead of pre-selecting the type of search, we could do better to show the types after you type by including an option like "search for 'searchterm'" as a first option, and below, using a dropdown header and/or divider to show below that the list shown are for topics, not searches? (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/dropdowns/#headers)

For the topic tree, i like the UI you're showing! Could it be adapted to nesting more than 1 layer deep? How would it look if a sub-item has its own sub-item? This will likely happen as we have a non-hierarchical set of relationships which can even be circular. 

For the date picker, there may be some challenges around paginating a date range. A date range could return hundreds of results but we'll have to paginate them or it'll be too big a database call. Can you talk a little about this challenge by looking in the current code? Maybe the hard part is that the code is already complex, so we want to be sure it remains legible even with this extra layer of complexity. And tests! But, i do really like the UI you've shown. Thanks!

Thanks for such a detailed proposal!
