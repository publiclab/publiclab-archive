Hi [@eithballocto](/profile/eithballocto), thank you so much for your proposal. I appreciate the time and work you've put in here and I think the ideas you're proposing are very interesting! However, I think that if you apply again with us, I suggest that you try to focus more narrowly on one or more of the ideas in our Ideas Page: https://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc-ideas#2021+Ideas

Different communities work differently, but for us the ideas page is where we highlight the projects we are most interested in for this session, and this comes from our Communities team's input balancing urgency, importance, and other factors. 

However I'd like to appreciate your thoroughness and creativity in the proposal you submitted, both of which we value highly, and to overall thank you for your good energy and interest in our projects!
