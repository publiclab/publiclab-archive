 More clarification on the display: For a battery powered logger, you could use an e-paper (e-ink) display which retains the image after it has been powered down. So when the low-power timer turns on the Arduino (e.g.,  every five minutes) which reads the sensor and writes to SD card, it can also update the display which will then be static until the Arduino powers up again. I think the e-paper display requires no power between updates.

[For $4.00 you can buy an e-paper (e-ink) display](https://www.ebay.com/itm/1-54-Inch-E-Paper-Module-E-Ink-Electronic-Display-Screen-Black-White-Color-SPI/113341650638?hash=item1a63b056ce:g:g~AAAOSweWdb-8TE&frcectupt=true) (1.5" x1.5"). I am not certain that this one works as I describe, but I just ordered a few to test.
