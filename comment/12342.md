I would be real careful about changing the buoyancy.  Get ALL of the bubbles out of the system.  The sign board should not have bubbles.  Are there any bubbles in the sign board where you mount the wings to the bottle?  Did you get all of the bubbles out of the syringe?  I mean both when you adjust the buoyancy and when you "fly" it.  What is with that red tail?  Are there bubbles in there also?  I also believe the buoyancy adjustment is demanding in accuracy.  Is the water you are "flying" in brackish?  If so there may be a significant difference in density with that and your bathtub water.

The gliders I am familiar with don't continually change their buoyancy.  The heavier it gets the faster it falls.  They tend to change the buoyancy initially on dive and then again on rise with perhaps some tweaks in between depending on the rate of depth change.
