Hello [@simransia07](/profile/simransia07), thank you for all the work you've put in here. Due to the very high number of applications, we have sought to provide feedback as evenly as possible, that is, ensuring as many people get /some/ feedback on their proposals as we can. This has sometimes meant that we haven't had time to provide multiple rounds of feedback for some proposals, such as yours at https://github.com/publiclab/infragram/issues/319. However, please know that we do read over everything as we make our decisions, and if we aren't writing back to each new idea it's not because we aren't seeing them or taking them into consideration in our choices. Thank you so much for your in-depth work on the designs and proposals here, and for your patience as we make our way through all the proposals.
