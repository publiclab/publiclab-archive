Hi! We just released a Node.js version of the core library here: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js

I think it'd be possible to take the image data and use the `node-canvas` module to extract data from an image headlessly; and there are node.js ways to capture from a webcam too. So you could try to run the whole thing offline using just Node.js.

I have an open issue for using `node-canvas` -- https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/issues/2

I don't know if you code any JavaScript but this seems like a good point to start from. Sounds interesting!
