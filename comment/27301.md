Hi Mike

Thanks for your response. I double-checked but it looks like the white balance on the Rasberry PI NoIR is set correctly. If I turn it off, I get very red images.  have set it to cloudy, and the original (non-NDVI image) looks like its fine. It's just when I run the NDVI in Infragram I get the blue images with no vegetation differentiation. 

I agree I have found it difficult to find instructions. I agree too this is a fantastic resource just wish I knew better how it all worked!

Thanks 
Sam
