i wanted to add some relevant terminology from the amazing g0v community as we work on conceptualizing our matchmaking: a **digger** is a person who identifies work that needs doing, a **pusher** is someone who encourages someone to get involved with that task, and a **filler** is the person who actually fills in the gap.
