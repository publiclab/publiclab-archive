Hi Tom, 
This is amazing. Your method has brought out so much detail in the image! To get even more feedback, consider posting to the plots-infrared list -- https://groups.google.com/group/plots-infrared
Also I wanted to invite you to a meetup focusing on infrared imaging that we are doing with FarmHack http://farmhack.net/forums/ifarm-imaging-agricultural-research-and-management-field-day-0. It is for Saturday May 18th at noon, in Lee, NH, and i will likely be traveling up there from NYC in some fashion.
