Hi, prof_braino - sorry you're having trouble. The mobile version works only on Opera Mobile for now, as it uses a very new feature of mobile browsers which is not yet widely available. 

On the desktop, you can use Chrome 21+ or Opera. 

You can also capture still images and upload them from any browser. 

Hope this helps!
