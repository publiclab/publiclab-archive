It was an article about making an exposure meter for use in film photography with real IF film. real IR film is no longer made now. I am pretty sure it was a solar cell. I will have to dig spectral curves for solar cells. Most cameras of the day had CDS cells and just putting a filter over the sensor cell wasn't accurate enough. I seam to remember their being some amplification circuit involved because while accurate solar cells don't produce much electricity especially with a real IR filter on them! Someone was selling pieces of good IF filter material left over after he cut round filter out of them on ebay. I will check and see if that still is a product.
