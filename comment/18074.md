Thank you for the article!  As mentioned in my posting, BRIX has been a standard tool used in the field ( current Consumer/Business product in the market https://www.consumerphysics.com/business/ ) to determine the quality of produce grown through sugar content (generally associated more with taste), although what I seek is more specific and more relevant to the nutritional value and health benefits of the produce...acquisition of the actual Phytonutrient Values of said produce would be much more advantageous to both the farmer and consumer.
