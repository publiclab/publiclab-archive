I was directly involved in the cleaning grassroots teams in Galicia/Spain during the [Prestige Oil Spill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestige_oil_spill) back in 2002. Around 63.000 tons of fuel spreaded from north of Portugal to french bretagne. 

Government efforts where directed to cover up the hole situation and materials brought to people to clean up the coast not apropriated. The worst, I think, were the masks. Goverment officials distributed dust masks to people grabbing fuel. Not gas masks. You can imagine the frequent episodes of nausea and vomiting.

I'd recomend to have a [dual filter carbon multigas mask](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=3m+multi+gas+mask&t=ffocus&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images&iai=http%3A%2F%2Fc.shld.net%2Frpx%2Fi%2Fs%2Fi%2Fspin%2Fimage%2Fspin_prod_210071001%3F%3Fhei%3D64%26wid%3D64%26qlt%3D50) (around 20$) some full Tyvek like none permeable suits (10$ each) some nitrilo long arm gloves (3$ each) and a pair of working glasses (10$)

Of course as in almost any work on the ground, mobile phone and all their magic possibilities: pictures, geolocation, notes, comunication, public outreach...
