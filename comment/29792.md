Looks like Harmful Algae Blooms are top of the list of direct threat to public health posed by the release of hot water into Lake Seneca. 

Summarizing from the article you posted from a colleague of NYC's civic tech scene writ large, Jessica McKenzie in Grist: https://grist.org/technology/bitcoin-greenidge-seneca-lake-cryptocurrency/

* Warming water has been shown to cause Harmful Algal Blooms in another of the Great Lakes, Lake Champlain.  
* Harmful Algal Blooms are damaging to human consumption such as by the people who draw their drinking water directly from this lake.
*  Harmful Algal Blooms cannot be removed by boiling, chemical disinfection, or water filtration. 

Maybe worth glancing at prior work on algae blooms here: https://publiclab.org/tag/algae
