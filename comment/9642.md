I'd definitely like to learn more about optical windows. I was actually preparing for something very similar to what you suggest since I didn't expect the images to come out as well as they did. I did some research and found the case made by https://joovuu.com/gb/home/103-mobius-waterproof-case.html. and was considering an alternate build akin to your suggestion that would use a larger version of the LED float that came in the same package. 
Seen here next to the float I ended up using-

But the case would have to ship from the UK and the pictures came out far better than I thought they would.  Plus, I only just now figured out how to change the focus on the lens and its already had a big impact on some tests I made.  I'm also a little concerned that theres a lot that could go wrong any time you cut holes into something what was a watertight enclosure and doing so might negate any advantages the float initially had.
I do agree with you about the optical lens though and I've also been looking into using the larger device as a sensor platform since it can pack a lot more electronics-

Pictured inside is a travel router configured to serve as an OpenWRT mesh node along with an Arduino Leonardo, a ds1820 temp sensor and a typicla pH probe.

I also just noticed some even cheaper devices that are supposed to float in a pool and automatically release chlorine.  I didnt see if it released on a set timer or if it makes its calculations based on water quality measurements.  If it turns out to be the latter, it could be the perfect floating sensor platform!
