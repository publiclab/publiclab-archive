If you look at some of Chris Fastie's work on the Infragram technique, he's posted a lot about theater gels as a way to filter certain wavelengths -- and indeed, the cheaper materials are typically not very precise. (http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-20-2013/superblue)

However, what about filtering *after* the diffraction grating, by making a "mask" of very opaque material (maybe printed on acetate or transparency paper, like Dave Stoft's done: http://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/05-14-2013/in-search-of-spectrometer-attenuators) and literally placing it such that it blocks parts of the spectrum once it's been separated out?
