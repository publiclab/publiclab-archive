[@davidmack](/profile/davidmack)  I don't know how much vacuum a 5lpm pump will produce but it needs to generate "below 7psia" to get sonic or choked flow.  An aquarium pump is only going to produce about 2 ft of water pressure and 7psia is around 200" of water. See comments in http://publiclab.org/notes/nshapiro/11-03-2014/diy-formaldehyde-test-kit#c11801

[@mathew](/profile/mathew) The "accepted" method is to score and then break. :-)  The "traditional" method is to use a triangle file.  The Kitagawa tubes are packaged with an abrasive chip.
The largest pipette I have seen from http://www.celltreat.com is 100mL for around $3 ea. in quantity.  I really did not look very far.  Another option would be a turkey baster that you calibrate.  If you have an accurate scale then you can use 1mL = 1gm of water.

I still suggest that the least expensive and accurate enough flow measurement is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_measurement#Orifice_plate   My mechanical engineer friend says a .0198" orifice and about 3" of water difference would do the trick.
