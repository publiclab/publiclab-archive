[@GreenFrogg](/profile/GreenFrogg) I was checking out your list of sensors on [this page ](https://www.samenmetenaanluchtkwaliteit.nl/actief-meten-van-luchtkwaliteit-sensoren) and didn't see the Purple Air. Have you worked with it? what are your thoughts on it in comparison to the ones you've been working with?
