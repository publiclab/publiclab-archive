So I took a new photograph with the adjusted config file, as I had indeed uploaded the wrong one. 

The photo looks like this when it is unadjusted
[![IMAG0078.JPG](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/018/639/large/IMAG0078.JPG)](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/018/639/original/IMAG0078.JPG)

But after putting it into the infragram.org basic red filter analysis it comes out mostly black again:

And after the colorized analysis it comes out like this (which looks mostly correct, but not as brilliant as the one you posted [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) )


[![delete_me2.png](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/018/641/large/delete_me2.png)](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/018/641/original/delete_me2.png)

Should I update any of the information in the SYSCFG file in order to make photos analyzed on infragram.org more compatible? We recently switched IR lenses and I want to make sure the final product is reliable to use and am in the process of updating the instructions so I want to get it all as correct and clear as possible for everyone!

Also if anyone has any suggestions, please state them!
