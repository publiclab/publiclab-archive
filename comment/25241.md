Hi, hope you had a great time in Ballon or kite mapping before uploading the captured images on Mapknitter.

1. I guess you did the following steps post clicking on "Create a map" button on Mapknitter page.
a) Location (Lat, long) of the map area
b) Name of the map
Then click on Create Map button below the map.

2. Then upload the images one after the other. Place on the map respectively.
Steps 1 and 2 would have been executed by you.

Now,  If you remember the map/ user name, type the same on the search bar, you should be able to find it.
Here is your map link, https://mapknitter.org/maps/gdntest1 (just type your user name and found)

Click on your profile, look into Mapknitter Maps, it will show the maps created by yourself.
