HEPA filters are a great choice for reducing particulate matter. Unfortunately, they are relatively ineffective for treating the gaseous compounds of concern (NH3, H2S, odors).

An easy addition may be to use that setup (#12171) with a combined HEPA/Activated Carbon filter (e.g. https://www.homedepot.com/p/Activated-Carbon-Passive-Window-Air-Purifier-AC-736/206173822). This would remove both particulate matter and the gases. 

Additional steps could be taken to further improve the effectiveness for these compounds (impregnated AC/proper sizing/design) and/or integrate other techniques (trickling/scrubbing for NH3). Buying raw GAC or powdered AC would likely be cheaper and enable different design applications. You could even make your own if you're so inclined.
