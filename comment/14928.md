Nice job mitigating those surprise electrocutions. Keep it up.

How does the weld actually work? What is the blob of "new" metal (the weld) made from? Can you file that down into a point?

I guess you have to calibrate these thermocouples. Or do they just work because science?

Very impressive achievement. Great post.
