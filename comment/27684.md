LDEQ doesn't know the answer to this question on the Lower Mississippi River.  here are the ways we are searching for the answer, in Louisiana, in order to help them.

Keep in mind, there are many [transportation-related](https://publiclab.org/notes/eustatic/09-09-2021/post-ida-nurdle-spill-from-plastic-rail-car-derailment-lessons-from-raceland?_=1636419550#) plastic sources, but until plastic is considered pollution per se by the United States, there's inconsistent requirements to report plastic spills. 

1) Texas' methods?  Texas keeps track of this, see the new plastics rulemaking.  Maybe they use the HW-1 NAICS codes?  But LDEQ doesn't do this, the HW-1 for TCI Plastics doesn't include Plastic!

2) [EIA data](https://www.eia.gov/state/maps.php) for "[Ethylene Crackers](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/edit?mid=1PS_gydKyioQOMsJ-59XKyOtzfT6wWFZ2&usp=sharing)"
**5 facilities**

3) we could make a public records request to LDEQ for any air permits along the MS River which mention "pellet" or some other code for "pellet handlers", which would be a pain unless we are sure about the code. 
--**returned 7 plastic facilities that handle pellets**, and make tons of PM 2.5 while handling them.

4) we could make a PRR LDEQ for water permits on the lower river that mention "pellet"
**LDEQ doesn't list pellets in water permits**
By the way, EPA has a GIS layer for NPDES_MAJOR which includes many facilities
https://erma.noaa.gov/gulfofmexico/#/layers=3+408&x=-90.89512&y=30.05808&z=10.5&panel=legend
This is the list LDEQ gives you when you ask them this question.  inane.

5) We could  search for PVC, Ethylene, Polystyrene, and polypropylene in the Chem Plants .pdfs  => **40 plants**
