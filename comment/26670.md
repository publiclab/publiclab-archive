Thank you for your kind feedback!☺

About making "Documenting and Reproducing bugs easier" I've got some ideas to include.  But i also want to know if this will be for users reporting bugs or for both users and developers?
 

Also, please, project description on outreachy website had mentioned "modify the "mapping" of HTML to Markdown" with an example page on publiclab/post.
Does this mean modifying how text is converted to markdown and back again to rich text? Because sometimes writing text in rich mode then switching  to markdown and to rich text mode again makes text to loose it's formatting, making it look like writing markdown in rich mode.?
