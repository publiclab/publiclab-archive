Is there a bug in the software that does not handle rotation correctly? Did / could you report it on github? https://github.com/jywarren/spectral-workbench/issues

I see what you mean about the oversaturated bands. Got it! Much better now. Last night I had good luck having folks add paper to the back of their phone around the lens to block reflections. As for myself, I'm still facing issues with the spectrum shown on the preview screen (which looks good) versus the clipped spectrum that gets captured.
