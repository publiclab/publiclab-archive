[@liz](/profile/liz) Sounds great. I think there are three parts and I'll probably ask for advice on posting as things develop: the build, the deployment, and the comparison of sensors (which will be distinct from deployment) . On travel for the next couple weeks so will be quiet for a bit. 

[@shantler](/profile/shantler) Thanks for the offer of the isolator circuit. I'll send address to both you and [@rockets](/profile/rockets). I was already trading stuff for someone to build circuit. Thanks in advance.
