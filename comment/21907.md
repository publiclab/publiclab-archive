 I've used a version of this method.  We used it for lead and just for visual comparison.  There was a link for it but it wouldn't work.  It was the USP, monograph 251, in the 2012 edition.  if you Google it, it should show up.
From the operator standpoint, it took a fair number of reagents and operat or time.  It's a good starting point!
More work to do on my end.
