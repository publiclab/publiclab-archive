So i think those are the SDA/SCL pins marked here:

I'm reading on a pinout diagram of the Arduino Uno that A4 = SDA and A5 = SCL, so here's a crude Photoshopped diagram replacing the Arduino with the Visualight:

Be aware -- the Visualight supplies 5V so we have to use the 5V version of the Melexis sensor. Also, the resistors are 4.7k Ohm. 

Who's gonna try it? Or better yet, make a little shield so we can make a bunch of these? We'd have to attach them to a USB battery pack, but it'll be really cool -- super bright and very compact.
