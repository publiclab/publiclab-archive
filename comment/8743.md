The "REVA" board looks awesome!  It looks like you can get a lot of the components you use at Adafruit now for a good price too, so that might help bring the price down even more.  I got a strip of ten bare RGB LEDs for $4 and they even started selling tiny little breakout PCBs to go with them for another $4.  I think they even started carrying the Melexis sensors in 3.3v and 5v too.
  BTW- Has anybody else had any luck getting the original Visualight to work?  I got one about a month ago and the only thing I can get it to do is run the thermal flashlight demo code that was posted a long time ago- http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/11-15-2013/visualight-board-for-thermal-flashlights.  I can't seem to get the WiFly to work with the custom firmware they wrote to program via the visualight.org web site.  I can get the WiFly to work on its own, and I can get the Leonardo to work on its own, but no way to change the color wirelessly...   I tried posting on the Visualight forum but it doesn't seem to be active anymore...
