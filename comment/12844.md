It sounds like you found a good system. Folks have been lifting cameras with these poles for many years, and there are a lot of different types of solutions. There are also a lot of different goals for pole photography. I wonder if a kit with a single mounting solution is the best way to market these poles. Maybe most people will need an alternate solution and would be better off with just the pole and lots of good instructions on a wiki. A separate mounting kit or two would also be good for those who needed a particular solution. There are lots of ideas at the KAP forum ([google:  site:http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/kap pole](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Farch.ced.berkeley.edu%2Fkap+pole&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS459US459&oq=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Farch.ced.berkeley.edu%2Fkap+pole&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.18425j1j8&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8))

For example, I approach this really differently:

*If you are using a pole for mapping, a good way to keep the camera pointed vertically is to let gravity do it. The material cost to attach a Redstone Rig to a pole is well under a dollar and it adds only 25 grams.*  

There are also some tips about repairing cracked carp poles at the KAP forum: <http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/kap/discuss/index.php?p=/discussion/1778/carp-pole-repair>
