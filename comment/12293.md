Hi, Amy! I think [@donblair](/profile/donblair) is busy deploying [Riffles](/wiki/riffle) in Colombia, but [@wmacfarl](/profile/wmacfarl) made an Upverter version of the circuit that's quite compact -- here: https://upverter.com/wmacfarl/ed1903e8ef25373b/Coqui----fixing-555-pinout/

I think you can order them online -- Will (wmacfarl) did and i have one. I think it needs to be tested out though - Will wasn't sure it was 100% correct.

I'm sure [@donblair](/profile/donblair) will have input and maybe a new version or something when he's back from his trip, but until then, this is what I'm aware of.
