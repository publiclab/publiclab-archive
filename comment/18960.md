[@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) I have read your profile.... You and I am are in the same college Delhi Technological University. It's great to see that.
If interested and if we get selected into gsoc, we could have a seminar as a part of 3rd evaluation. [@warren](/profile/warren) I would like to have a seminar at my college as a part of 3rd evaluation so that more people will get acquainted with the open source and especially about our community. So, that the new developers will be able to quicken the pace which we are lacking at public labs.
Especially the editor project is not touched for many years so that may be enhanced from thereafter by other nerds.
[@warren](/profile/warren) I don't know whether it is a good idea or not. [@ebarry](/profile/ebarry) [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) from you guys too I want to know whether I should include it in the resume?
