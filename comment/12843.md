I used a cracked piece of this pole to stress test the conduit idea, and happy to report that leveraging on the mount as hard as I could, the pole broke below the conduit, but not right at the lever point. Meaning it wasn't the pressure from the conduit on the one point, but the overall force that made it fail. I really had to lean into this thing to make it go, too. With the conduit in place, as long as you didn't really whip the pole around I believe this would be safe for any small camera. I might explicitly say in instructions not meant for DSLRs just ot be safe, though
