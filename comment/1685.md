Hi Sara,
The NDVI analysis did not get very far because these images did not register very well. Without good alignment of the NIR and visible image pairs, the NDVI images are not very meaningful. The problem might have been due to the parallel arbors confusing the alignment algorithms. Ned Horning has since improved his ImageJ plugin (which replaces the original macro), so we might be able to do better on the image registration. But I should also retake the mapping images when the vines are lusher later in the  season. So much to do.
