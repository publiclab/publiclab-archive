This is a great idea for a project! I lived in Guangzhou near the river for around one year a while ago. There used to be an event once a year where the mayor and other "officials" used to swim through the river to proove how clean it is. Of course, they shut down factories etc. upstream several weeks in advance.
Keep going!
