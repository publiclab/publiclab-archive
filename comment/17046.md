Dear Ned Horning, 

I calculated image calibration coefficients, using the reflectance data from department's spectrometer and 3 calibration targets. I found a good correlation of R2 0.9432 for Visible which at 600 nm and R2 0.84332 at reference 850 nm for NIR.  But looking at the graph , i was wondering what the image values with the range (0.0-1.0) ? How i can calculate the image values manually using ImageJ and shouldn't this value be something between (0-255) as i saw in some other posts at public labs?

I look forward to hear from you Ned. 

Thank you so much
