[@MadTinker](/profile/MadTinker), according to my knowledge, the reason why to use "isolation" is to avoid interrupting between sensors. Both OPR and EC need isolation. Other options include Atlas Scientific's (https://www.atlas-scientific.com) "isolated board", however it does not compatible with DFRobots' sensor. (btw, Atlas has all the sensors you need as well). DFRobots can lend you the isolation module if you want, since it is not for sale yet. and when you finish using, you can give back to PL's lending library (there's no such thing not yet, but according to [@bronwen](/profile/bronwen) will happen soon)
