Hey ikerluna!  I don't know about the webcam you're using or how it's designed, but basically any webcam focus is going to be adjusted by moving the lens(es).  On mine it twists to move up and down a bit, and that's how you get it in focus.  However, there gets to be a problem once you remove the infrared filter.  When light goes through a lens, the angle it bends at depends on it's wavelength.  So essentially, different colors get bent differently by the lenses, so colors that lined up at first tend to get blurred.  (If you zoom in to see individual pixels on a high quality image you'll often see a red tint on one side and a blue tint on the other of an object.)  For red through blue light the effect isn't usually enough to make a big difference.  However, when you start looking at the infrared light sent through a lens designed for visible light, the effect becomes greater.  You can help it a bit by adjusting the focus as I suggested, but the short story is that you're probably not going to be able to focus the infrared+plus visible light perfectly.  

To get as best as you can, start at a point that is out of focus, and move the lens a bit closer or further.  If it gets better, do that some more.  If it gets worse, go the other way.  And just repeat that with progressively finer adjustments until you've got the optimum focus.  Be sure you're looking at a good test object (some sharp contrasts on it for good reference) at about the distance you're wanting to take the pictures.
