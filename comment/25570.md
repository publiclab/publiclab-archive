Hi, Isha! I'm going into SDG with these files, uploaded by a community member with an air sensor: 

https://gist.github.com/jywarren/0230c6e79794d3aa1cf2abe868971019 (4 distinct files)

It's a great example use case. This is the kind of thing people really want to use SDG for! 

For example, there are too many columns. We really only want to look at a few, like time, temperature, pressure, humidity, and a few of the far-to-the-right ones; `pm1_0_atm,pm2_5_atm,pm10_0_atm`

Using https://publiclab.github.io/simple-data-grapher/ - there are just too many columns to select! I think we need to make it be horizontally scrollable. 

Also, I think i found the ordering of the `X-axis` and `Y-axis` toggle to be a bit odd - like, it seemed like i was using the toggle above the `Plot graph` button, but choosing the columns below? 

I wonder if it's possible for SDG to auto-detect a time-based column, and default to using that as the x-axis?

Then, i had some trouble with the screen not letting me scroll down to see the graph:


[![Screen_Shot_2019-09-23_at_6.08.57_PM.png](/i/35419)](/i/35419?s=o)

However, overall this was a really cool way to try exploring this data. I was also really impressed at the CODAP integration! This data file was a bit big for CODAP to handle, but it was very cool to see it uploaded so easily. Maybe a "full screen CODAP" view would be nice, or an "Open Codap in a new window" for once you're done exporting, would be nice? 

Awesome work!
