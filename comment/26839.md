Hi [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1) great to hear you're interested in following the project. [@sophied](/profile/sophied) and I have already been gradually (and sporadically) collecting data on cloud cover, storms systems, sea surface temperature and a few other variables from NOAA satellite transmissions. However we're looking to extend our practice to decode transmissions from the Meteor M N2 satellite and perhaps one day, geostationary satellites. We're interested to engage with the PL community on intersections between these sorts of datasets and what others might be collecting via other forms of aerial imaging or atmospheric measurements but we're completely open to other ideas!
