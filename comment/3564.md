Nice note, Christen.  The impetus for this project was to determine how much vacant space the cemetery has.  The cost of upkeep is on the rise, so selling additional burial plots is a way to generate revenue.  To determine this, a high resolution map must be generated.  Looks like you guys are well on your way!
