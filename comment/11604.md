we would probably want 1 degree accuracy as the visual read out of the tube has to be multiplied by a temperature coefficient on a 1 degree scale. it would only be a 3% difference between degrees, but that is added to 10% variation in the entire method so we could chop that 3 percent out by having one degree accuracy on the thermo.
