The older usp method was based on hydrogen sulfide.  This was later changed to a thioacetamide based test.  This is better, but still not good. These are general tests for heavy metals and relatively inexpensive.  You can get much more expensive tests based on chromatography, atomic absorption, ICP, and a slew of other methods.  But you will pay for it either in time or in instrument cost.  These are the trade offs you have to make.
