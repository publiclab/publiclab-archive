Please check out the link in my last comment to ensure your projects are modular and broken into small issues. 

I've seen some nice screenshots or mockups by some folks; this is helpful too! 

And if you can link to your proposals from any relevant issues on GitHub that's also helpful. Thanks, great to see these!
