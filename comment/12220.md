Check out my recent note where I review several different kites as Mobius Lifters- http://publiclab.org/notes/ajawitz/06-07-2015/2015-kap-mapping-season-in-midcoast-maine
 
In case you'll be flying over the ocean or water you might also be interested in checking out my floating/waterproof camera housing http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/07-09-2014/kap-rig-for-mobius-action-cam.

RE- Soft Lifters-
  I had the same idea when I first started in KAP, but as you'll see in my review of the Powersled, I found the smaller models are too unstable while the bigger ones like the KAPfoil are either way too expensive or overkill for something as light as a Mobius...  I did however, recently get one of the new airfoils by Prism called the (Bora 7)[http://www.prismkites.com/products-sl-bora.php] and I'm thinking it might be much more stable because of the long tail.  I'll have to give it a try and report back!
