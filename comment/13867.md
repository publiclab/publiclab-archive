Hey Dave, well I was thinking along the lines of when I built a wind speed indicator with a small dc motor and LCD screen attached and calibrated it by having a friend drive at different speeds while I logged the voltage as related to that speed (rough way of doing it but it worked.)

I understand what you are saying about the PWM increasing intensity, but that's the whole point with fluorescence, that's also why I hooked up with this person, Dr. Friedrich Menges in Austria, the developer of spekwin32. I also understand the manufacturing process, I use to be an assembler level 3 at KC automation (which is know bought out by Borgtwalt in Germany.) we did 90 percent in house, I built from the ground up, the 20 port cigarette smoke analysis machine and the Side Stream smoker analyzer(which analyzes second hand smoke.) that's what we did there building Lab and industrial quality high precision equipment.

 This kind of work I have never done but I have always been very facsinated by it and a friend of mine had a sample of something that they wanted to see if I could find out what it was, and I just happened to come across this spectrometer kit, since I just didn't have 30,000.00 to get a decent one. now I'm hooked and I'm learning a lot, and I'm sure I will continue to learn and refine my prep and technique.

Perhaps your correct about voltage and wavelength begin separate, I'd like to know how some of these spectrometers can have their wavelengths adjusted, I'll find out.
