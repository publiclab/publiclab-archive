Hi, [@ryzokuken](/profile/ryzokuken)! I wanted to re-propose the idea of periodically (daily) looking at recent questions:

https://publiclab.org/tag/question:*.json

...and if they haven't been responded to in more than a day, offer to help by adding tags, alerting some organizers by email, or something? [@liz](/profile/liz) have ideas on what next steps could be?
