Hi [@read_holman](/profile/read_holman) , can you see if your link to "Cornell University (choose “Environmental Analysis following US EPA SW-846”)" may have been updated to http://cnal.cals.cornell.edu/analyses/ ? Also i'm not seeing the particular test "EPA SW-846" mentioned anywhere on Cornell's page.
