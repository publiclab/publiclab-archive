I'm adding one more discovery. 

I had been using a CD-R for the window because I have plenty of scrap versions of them. I decided to sacrifice a DVD-R after discovering that the pitch is finer (740nm for a DVD-R versus 1.6um for a CD-R). 

Sure enough, the resolution was better. Compare "CFLCal6DVD" another calibration with the CD-R as the window such as "CFLCal5" or "CFLCal4".  More definition, better resolution with the DVD-R.
