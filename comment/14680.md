The flexible PVC tubing is exactly the right size to slip inside the third smallest carp pole section. To stiffen the connection I insert a length of stiff carbon tube inside the flexible tubing. You can see the details in this note: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/12-24-2015/tales-from-the-cryptogam. I think I should insert the carbon tube even farther into the flexible tubing from now on to relieve some pressure from the end of the carp pole section.

I'm not sure what you mean about the PVC when the pole is vertical. With a rig dangling from the pole end, the pole is rarely very vertical. If I wanted a more vertical pole, e.g., for more height, I would use a Juno Bracket. Even with the penultimate pole section, the Juno can hold a camera angled any way you want with the pole vertical or near vertical. So the camera can be 9.4 m above ground, or more if you lift the entire pole off the ground.

When capturing photos for NDVI, you really have to know what your goal is. If the crop plants are small and there is bare soil between them, you can't avoid getting soil in the photos. Even when the crop is mature the soil can often be seen in nadir photos, so if you don't want that you have to shoot oblique photos. If soil will be included in the photos, you have to make sure a consistent and representative proportion is included in all of the photos which will be interpreted. It's a bit of an art capturing photos that can be interpreted for NDVI.
