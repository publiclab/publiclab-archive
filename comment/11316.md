Hi Wbugar. I'm planning on writing a more coherent note on how to put this thing together and a parts list once I get a lid printed for the new design. But for now, the parts include a [condenser lens](http://www.edmundoptics.com/optics/optical-lenses/ball-condenser-lenses/condenser-lenses/43483/), a [focusing mirror](http://www.edmundoptics.com/optics/optical-mirrors/focusing-concave-mirrors/commercial-grade-concave-spherical-mirrors/27624), a [diffraction gratting](http://www.edmundoptics.com/optics/gratings/holographic-diffraction-grating-film/01307/), a [CCD array detector](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?mpart=TSL1406R&vendor=1194) and a [microcontroller](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?KeyWords=EK-TM4C123GXL&WT.z_header=search_go). You will also need eight [#8](/n/8) screws for mounting the mirror and slit and two [#2](/n/2) screws for mounting the CCD detector.
