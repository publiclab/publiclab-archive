HI Michael, 

If you were interested in collecting data on radiation from water or seaweed near your house or lab, posting it here on Public Lab in a research note could be a great way to document what you find and share it with a large audience. Have you already done some preliminary testing? 

Here are some project that might be of interest:

Kelp Watch is no longer collecting data but could be worth contacting.
