This is so great. Mathew - how many flights is 1lb of pigment good for? I have the 1lb jar you gave me, will probably try it this summer, but am happy to ship anyone some amount of it if they like.

If this starts to really become popular, we could buy a 50lb bag and resell, i suppose. Do you happen to know the cost of the 50lb bag?

BTW I love that their product image on the pigment website is of a pigment molecule. Talk about open source... lol
