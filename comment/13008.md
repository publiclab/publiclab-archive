Exciting stuff! I'd second the easy AA battery option. I can solder at a basic level, but the less it's required, the less it can go wrong.

I don't have the technical knowledge to make an informed comment about which pins I'd prepare on the 2x7. As far as applications are concerned, it might be good to support connecting to a cellular modem with a long cable, so the riffle can collect data submerged with the modem mounted somewhere above the surface.
