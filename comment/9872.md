One would expect updates to be more rare than reads by a high margin.

In terms of server work duties, checking for fresh data upstream github would be more sensible as a request of the original author, reflecting when changes have been made by the author. Looking for updates on each page read is hugely inefficient given the assumed ratio of reads versus updates and could bog the server down needlessly.
