Warren,

I know that the spectrometer that I have built is extremely rigid, but it is not made of cardboard,
It is made from square black plastic rainwater down-pipe.
If you look back through some of my submissions you will see photos of it.
Is black plastic rainwater down-pipe available in the USA? If it is, I will gladly describe how I made my rigid and opaque spectrometer.
