Ah! And i realized another feature i forgot to mention -- you can now see the model of camera used to take the photos, which is extracted from the EXIF metadata of the image file. This last one said:

> GoPro, HERO3+ Black Edition

The great part is now that we have a URL to correct that particular model of camera (and lens) -- at least a pretty decent attempt as I've made:

**GoPro, HERO3+ Black Edition:** https://jywarren.github.io/fisheyegl/example/#a=1.048&b=1.059&Fx=0.13&Fy=0.34&scale=1.087&x=1&y=1
