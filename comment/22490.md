Here is the EPA's take on that: https://www.epa.gov/air-research/village-green-project 

Its rather expensive but losing the PM 2.5 monitor would save a lot of money. 

These things are built to last, which is great, but I'm sure there are better ways to cultivate engagement. EPA has one of these expensive benches just blocks away from me and despite being an air quality nerd I never look at that single data point. 

There are 23 weather underground stations in new orleans. I wonder if the design money could go into integrating that data in the bench rather than putting up another monitor, which will break and need maintenance.
