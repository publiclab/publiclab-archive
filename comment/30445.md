Studying about our population is vital because the number of people in the world is growing rapidly. The number of births this year is 88,386,059. More people also means that we will have more waste and pollution is going into our environment. More people are being born than there are dying. There are about 4.5 births every second. There are about 1.8 deaths per second. 

    Our world has limited resources, and if our population keeps increasing, everyone will not have access to vital necessities. We already have enough people in the world without safe drinking water, approximately 779,820,448. Food is also something important that many don’t have access to. There are 863,057,192 unfortunate souls that deal with malnourishment due to the lack of food. Another issue is healthcare. It is expensive in America, that’s why many don’t have it. If the number of people goes up, so does the demand for healthcare. This will make it more expensive, resulting in less people being able to afford it. Our current Public Healthcare expenditure today is $ 5,789,654,123, and it’s still growing rapidly.
