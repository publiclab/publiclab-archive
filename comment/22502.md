Here is a better answer. The first time the sketch tries to read the BMP280 sensor is immediately after the sensor has been initialized. So the sensor is not ready and erroneous data is read. 

So I put a 0.5 second delay after the initialization of the sensor and that seemed to fix the issue. 

The updated sketch is available at the [Guides page](http://kaptery.com/guides/) and [here](http://kaptery.com/files/documents/nanodatalogger_bmp02.ino).
