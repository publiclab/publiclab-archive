Watch this video from Mountain Justice monitoring conductivity in the streams throughout the watershed where mining is happening: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/4-29-2011/video-geocoded-conductivity-readings-strip-mine-watersheds . See other mine monitoring content on https://publiclab.org/tag/mining and if you like, leave comments to reach out to the authors.

We held a Barnraising in West Virginia in 2016 with [@LauraChipley](/profile/LauraChipley) and others who work against mountaintop removal mining https://publiclab.org/wiki/appalachia-barnraising-2017

There are many more international examples, perhaps others could add them here.
