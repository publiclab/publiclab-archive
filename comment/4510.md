Warren, as I understand you, no.  What I am doing is magnifying the
intensity variation between the different color bands in the 
image as presented, to squeeze out the information about
response to different parts of the 700-800nm band.
I'll modify my post to try to explain this better sometime
in the next few days.

Dan, the good thing and the bad thing about me is that I am a
numbers guy, so I have only an intuitive notion of what you 
mean by color table. Can you link me to an explanation? 
Besides, the little water we have out here often looks green.
 :c) 

Off to work...
