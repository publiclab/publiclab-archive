[@dhaffnersr](/profile/dhaffnersr) - What is the layout of your test system? For example, is it as easy as hooking up the camera + downloading the software = waveform spectra plots? Would you mind shooting me an email and maybe exchanging info? I really want to understand this before mine arrives this week.
