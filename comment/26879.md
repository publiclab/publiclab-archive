Thanks [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) for this in-depth response! Your experience is literally invaluable. Also great to see [@nedhorning](/profile/nedhorning)'s name come up. I'm wondering next steps are clear for [@brendan_stanford](/profile/brendan_stanford), and if any institutional outreach to Astro Pi foundation with ESA (formerly https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/astro-pi-upgrades-launch/) might be in order regarding the filter material. The Rosco filter company itself blogged about fabrication here: https://www.rosco.com/spectrum/index.php/2018/03/rosco-filter-helps-students-observe-earths-vegetation-from-space/. [@warren](/profile/warren) do you have any memories or points of contact regarding the choice of filter color discussion with Astro Pi Foundation to add in here? I don't see that i have any email records myself. 

 I'm wondering if we might invite people working with NDVI into a video call to really compare notes on the different software options for processing images into NDVI. The 3pm open call slot (see https://publiclab.org/open-call) on Tuesday May 26 is already booked by the "direct download of satellite images using ham radio techniques" crew (https://publiclab.org/questions/sashae/05-15-2020/is-anyone-working-on-the-reception-of-satellite-imagery-using-ham-radio-methods), so we could take 2pm https://everytimezone.com/?t=5ec9b900,438 or 4pm https://everytimezone.com/?t=5ec9b900,4b0 ? Here are the times I have available to facilitate: https://www.when2meet.com/?9165414-2DwFU please fill in your availability if interested. Thanks!
