I should add, we have done this experiment using the old turntable spectroscopes using the flame thrower apparatus with good results. We used a proper diffraction grating. It takes some calculation to extract the wavelength of the spectrum from first principles. This method using the PLOTS software is so much better for this purpose.

We've also used a commercial datalogger (vernier labquest) and spectrovis (their digital spectrometer) which also requires the use of logger pro software. All up that set up cost in the order of $1500 (Au). To do it for less than $10 is simply amazing and enables us to use a class set of spectroscopes that the students can construct themselves.

One useful addition that spectrovis has, at extra cost, is an optical fibre connection. This simply fits into the spectrometer where the cuvettes normally sit. We used his to in order to observe flame spectra. I'm thinking of grabbing some optical fibre and seeing if we couldn't craft up a device that we could simply point at the flame or for reflection spectroscopy at, say, a leaf. Feed the image in through the fibre to the slit and it would add versatility to an already awesome piece of kit.
