Hi!
There is a know glass company out there named SCHOTT AG.
Besides being a big player in that business they also have nice data sheets with lots of details at any optical filter.
You find it under:
http://www.schott.com/advanced_optics/german/download/schott_all_collection_datasheets_optical_glass_filter_october_2011.pdf

And then there is furthermore an older catalog with lots of information on filter. It is quite interesting and you can specify what kind of glass, plastic lens or filter you are looking for and narrow it down to finde something useful between the thousands of glass types on the market.
You find this under:

Please let me know if this kind of information is useful to you - maybe attending 1 year the lectures on Technical Optics Engineering, Lighting and and 2 years on Precision Engineering can help.
