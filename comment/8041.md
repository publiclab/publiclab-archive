Of course!  We do need credit or debit card to buy the unit, so as long as you have that we'd love to have you.  It's $150 bucks to cover the cost of the device for the beta, but later versions will be much cheaper (we're adding a lot to this version because we want everyone to have the same capabilities during the beta).
