Jeff - right, higher BRIX largely means higher sugars. It's interesting to consider building a reference library of spectra from "nutrient-dense" examples of particular crops to get measurements of more than suspended solids (largely sucrose). Or, alternatively, to start looking for specific minerals across multiple crops with a spectrometer. 

I think the BRIX fans are imagining a day when there would be a simple-to-use consumer-level refractometer that someone would bring with them while grocery shopping. 

By the way, it was very interesting to hear my farmer friend Deb Taft say that she was interested to use a refractometer in the field in order to train her eyes to recognize the signs of sucrose-dense crops. In other words, using a technological sensor to calibrate her own senses.
