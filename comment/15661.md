Hi Stevie, 
I have been using the Mobius ActionCam (https://www.mobius-actioncam.com/) for monitoring silica sand mines in small towns around Wisconsin. I have been monitoring these sites to try and observe a blasting event, where elevated levels of particulates are released into the air as a direct result of the blasts. I have been using the time lapse setting on the camera which takes a photo at a 2 minute interval. The camera does have a motion sensor setting, but I am hesitant to use it because I am unsure if the disturbance of the blast would be enough to trigger the motion sensor. 

Overall I think that this camera is a good camera, but there are some things that could be better. 
1. I have had an issue with fogging in the lense. It could be from internal temperature change, or just a result of morning dew. Regardless when the lenses are fogged, pictures are rendered useless. This problem has lasted up to 2 consecutive days, although a duration this long is rare. 
2. The battery life could be improved. The battery life is limited by the physical size of the camera. The camera is very small, which means that the battery is pretty small as well. The battery lasts just under a week typically, but it can vary greatly depending on the setting that you use. 

The photos produced by this camera are of good resolution. The photos can be white-washed when facing into the sun, so the camera should be positioned where the exposure won't be as direct. I would be happy to send you some of the photos that the  camera has taken if you would like.

If you do end up using the Mobius Actioncam or a similar camera, the best set up would be close to the stream (10-20 meters) for best resolution results. The photos turn out best when lighting changes doesn't change too drastically, so if there is a shaded spot that ensures a consistent lighting throughout most of the day, that's your best bet. 

Hope this helped :)
