Hello,

Sorry just noticed this post. I've been collecting my links and references on this [DIY gas sensor calibration page](http://circuitsci.com/wiki/doku.php/techinfo:gassensorcal) of my wiki. I'm also tinkering with some DIY zero air generator ideas, as often the biggest problem is sorting out a sensor baseline that drifts with temperature and so on. Don't need fancy gases for that, but does require some thought and more prototyping before I have much more useful to say about all of that. 

I'm curious if you have a public collection of this stuff going already? I'll post again here when I have any major updates.

Thanks,
Ken
