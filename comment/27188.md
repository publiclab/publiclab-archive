Hi sashae,
I had a read through what is needed for receiving Meteor images but it looks as though much of the software is Windows only.

BTW I have used two different RTL-SDR dongles and can confirm what some others seem to have found. The genuine original in a silver coloured aluminium case is good with reasonably low noise. The cheaper black cased one I tried is very noisy. Perfectly suitable for strong local signals but poor with weaker signal from spacecraft. Worth paying the extra to get good results.

I found a length of RG214 (silver plated copper and thick shielding). I replaced half my long run with that and can see in improvement in received signal. Always room for improvement.
