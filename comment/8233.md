I can't seem to post photos in the comments, so here's some links to my dropbox. This time I dialed exposure down by -1.66. Then I calibrated white balance on a pure red surface (ipad cover) in bright sunshine. Then took a photo with -1.66 exposure settings. Results below:

Really interesting to see that this time with color stretching the results are now also much more acceptable. Previously this would just overamplify shadows far too much. It's still very visible it happens though. I'm happy with these results given the complexity of the scene.

I notice that sometimes the 'neutral' comes out light green and other times light blue. In the levels tool of gimp this level can be changed by moving the middle slider of only the blue channel (not all, not the red). This can be done without significantly affecting the overall results of the image. If the red channel is manipulated that way the shadows become overintensified.

Let me know what you think!
