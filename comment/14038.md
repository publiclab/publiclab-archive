Hey Jeff, I used the green laser (532nm) because of the excitation wavelength of rhodamine b, which is about 543nm, that's why I displayed the excitation and emission data also, to show the excitation at 100ppm which was 536nm and 100ppb was 538nm.

So my experiment was pretty close to predicted excitation wavelengths, plus I am still working on my  sample procedures so I get them correct.
