 [@warren](/profile/warren) [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) [@namangupta](/profile/namangupta) .. Couldn't we implement both since the one in gitter would work only if someone is online and a recent notifications tab could help the user see all the latest comments and posts while the user was offline. Also, Pop-ups like the one on gitter are quite good but can be easily ignored. An integration of both would be really helpful. 

Edit: I just noticed the activity section in PL's dashboard. Isn't it the notifications tab like fb in this discussion?
