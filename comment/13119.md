some sensors, like 1-wire sensors, have a unique hex code already to allow them to be networked.  You could record a registry of those easily and associated metadata. 

Given that temperature is basic functionality, the inclusion of a one-wire temp sensor on a board like the riffle could then be used as a unique device ID. 

here's an idea for a registry that builds on existing infrastructure:

1) make a wiki page for a piece of hardware with some details about said hardware.  maybe even a series of standard fields that some software might want to look for.
Tag the shortlink with 'HWregistry' and a parent:project tag so it is a part of a project specific hardware 'registry' linked at the top of the object page.

2) use the wiki page 'shortlink' as a unique ID, write shortlink on the device as its ID.

3)??? machine read wiki pages if needed? standardized label templates? labels that ship with stuff?
