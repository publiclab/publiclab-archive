Aside form the research goals, I've always wanted to create something that everyone could make on their own. And don't worry about the soldering - my early builds were really rough looking - but as long as they work, you get data.  After you make a few, you will be surprised how fast they start to look better. Just keep at it!

Also, having good tools helps with the fine details. I've been happy with Hakko tools for strippers, soldering iron, etc.
