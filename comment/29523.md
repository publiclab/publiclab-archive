I think it all depends on the sampling rate and whether the data converge, ha. 

For electronic monitors sampling every few seconds, two weeks isn't bad.  I think a month won't hurt. But it also depends on what happens in that month.  

Ideally, the "real" PM2.5 readings cover the full range of what is possible during your sampling period, so, in Louisiana, for example, I would run a co-location during Sugar Cane harvest season, to make sure the meters read at similar rates during cane burns, when PM swings are large and dramatic.

With Particulate Matter, there are usually issues with non-convergence at the lower readings. It's either good or bad that different units seem disagree more at lower PM levels.   Consult your expert.
