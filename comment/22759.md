I see a couple leads here, one by [@jschaffr](/profile/jschaffr) : 

* https://publiclab.org/notes/jschaffr/11-21-2011/controlled-testing-bw-film-hydrogen-sulfide-detectors
* https://publiclab.org/notes/JSummers/11-20-2014/toward-calibrating-h2s-sensors

[@JSummers](/profile/JSummers) especially has thought through the disposal question a good bit, happily. 

[@sophie](/profile/sophie) also had a post up on using a flame hood for protection -- i think this one: https://publiclab.org/notes/sophie/07-16-2014/sensing-hydrogen-sulfide-from-cafo-emissions-in-poweshiek-county-iowa

I know that test didn't seem to have worked out, but based on what Sophie wrote, I think there may be some good ways to build on that as a framework for validation:

> I am currently doing a trial run to test whether the samplers can, under laboratory conditions, detect H2S levels at or below 30 ppm. I obtained 6 25-gallon emergency water storage bags and placed two treated photo paper strips in each (film canisters wouldn’t fit through the openings). Each bag was then filled with 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 50 ppb of H2S, shaking them every day to ensure even gas distribution. After two weeks, I retrieved and fixed the paper to determine if any darkening has occurred. The results seem to indicate that either this technique is not sensitive enough to detect such low levels of H2S, or that this method of testing was problematic (picture below).
