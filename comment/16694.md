Thanks for this Nigel! I'm especially interested in hearing what the kids think about the limitations and the new ideas you come up with -- like the LEDs that change colors in public to demonstrate conductivity readings!!!

Could you tell a little bit more about what kind of group this is, and how they became interested in the Coqui? I'm not sure, but I imagine that folks who see this would like to hear that story.
