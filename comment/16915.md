Thanks Ed, 
 
I disabled the LEDs and deployed the Mini Pearl Logger in the compost pile again. The batteries lasted 6.5 days instead of 2.3 days. So I guess that really isolates the SD card and board as the energy hog. I am using that big Catalex microSD board in the photos above instead of the smaller boards that you are using. I also used a 4GB uSD card (it says SanDisk but who knows). I guess that combination is so bad that it drains the batteries in a week.  

So I have ordered some of the little microSD card boards that you use with the four separate resistors. Also ordered some smaller microSD cards. Until they arrive, is there anything to try with the SD boards I have? Is there any way to disable or bypass the level shifter or regulator on the boards I have?

I am also confused about sleeping the SD card board. My sketch uses your code to explicitly sleep the processor:  

     LowPower.powerDown(SLEEP_FOREVER, ADC_OFF, BOD_ON);

Do I need other code to sleep the SD card/board?  I used your code to pull up the SPI pins:

     digitalWrite(chipSelect, HIGH);    //pullup the CS pin
     digitalWrite(MOSIpin, HIGH);       //pullup the MOSI pin
     digitalWrite(MISOpin, HIGH);       //pullup the MISO pin

How does the SD card know to sleep?

I can't wait to get the new components and try to beat 6.5 days.

*Temperature data from two MCP9808 sensors in the middle of a compost pile that was cooling off. The LEDs on the Arduino Pro Mini board and RTC board were disabled. The batteries powering the Mini Pearl Logger lasted about 6.5 days which is more than twice as long as they lasted when the LEDs were present, but not long enough.*
