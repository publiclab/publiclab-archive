Just checking .... what is the mechanical relationship between the dimensions of the paper module and the inside dimensions of the laser-cut cover? It appears that as the bolts are tightened, the top/bottom will ultimately determine the minimum interior width so do the paper tolerances stack up to guarantee a 'snug' but not compressed fit? I was just thinking about the extremes -- loose fit and then there's not enough stability, tight where the plastic warps a bit compressing the paper box and wondering if the tolerances on the paper might be a difficulty. The alternate is to make it slightly loose and require the base support in the paper box be screwed to the plastic -- which might be the more repeatable option.
