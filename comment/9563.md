Bryan, maybe this is what you remember. We deployed a bunch of these in the tundra 15 years ago:

.  
They don't seem that rugged to me. I wonder if certain construction techniques will withstand -40Â° C better than others. Does an Arduino have an operating temperature range? 

These also have to be protected from water, but that's a separate issue. It's not rocket science to put something in a waterproof case. But unlike the stand-alone loggers,  my proposal calls for cables connecting each sensor. So that requires careful design where the cables pierce the enclosure, but it should not be much of an obstacle. Each  microcontroller needs a weatherproof case with four cables attached. Each sensor is a tiny component that would need a tiny waterproof case at the end of a cable, and the light sensors need a transparent window. But maybe just a glob of silicone would suffice for each sensor (or cluster of redundant sensors).

Is there really any reason to suspect that a simple circuit board in a waterproof enclosure (with some silica gel) would not survive the winter under a tree in Alaska?
