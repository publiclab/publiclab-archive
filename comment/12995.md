Correct. If the Wratten 25A camera requires exposures that are too long, you can just shoot normal photos and use the red channel for VIS (so don't install the Wratten 25A, just put it in front of the lens). Flying during the brightest part of the brightest days will help a lot. 

You might also want to shoot with the Wratten 87 in front of the lens of the Pi NoIR, so you keep your options open. For example, if you put the Wratten 25A in front of the Pi NoIR, the red channel will be mostly red light and the blue channel will be mostly NIR. So that one camera can provide a facsimile of NDVI.

If you fly both cameras (Pi Cam with no added filter and Pi NoIR with Wratten 87) you get four channels (R,G, B, and NIR). That makes many indices and false color IR images (NRG) possible. The VIS bands are not very pure colors, but it doesn't matter so much for false color IR.
