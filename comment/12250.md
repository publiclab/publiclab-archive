Well, the procedure itself might or might not reference data. But anyone who goes through the steps of the procedure will surely generate data. It's the difference between a template and the thing you make **with** a template. Make sense? We need good vocab for this: `procedure` vs. `procedure run` ?

Popping up in a new browser window? Yes, i think so. But you'd have to AJAX poll on the procedure page to check if the user has completed capturing the spectrum. 

I had guessed that the spectrum would need a foreign key of the procedure run -- perhaps via a tag. In the sense that the spectrum would "belong to" the procedure run.
