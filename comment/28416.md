Thanks for this great tutorial, [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)! This is exactly what i needed for my ESP-12 + BME280 + EPaper display project. I use 300mAh Li-ion battery, which now lasts for only about 3 days for a thing that once a minute wakes up for ~3 seconds to do the measurements and update an epaper display â€” such a shame!)

For my working draft i used a PMV65XP mosfet, as i hadn't have a chance to get the one from the tutorial. Also, as i need an interval of a minute, i put 33k and 75k resistors in parallel, soldered one on another, so i got 22.92k which stands perfectly for 1 minute and 4 seconds.

Cheers, Alex!
