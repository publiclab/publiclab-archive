Very cool. We'll have to check our 'secret file' to see how well you did on your proposed matches. 

I was interested in the difference in diesel scans between [#2](/n/2) and [#5](/n/5), and the rest. Any idea why they're different but consistent?

I also really liked your comparison between diesel and crude -- as expected they're quite different and it's great to see such differentiation. Interesting also to think about the fact that diesel is refined from crude, so in theory crude is a mixture of all these samples, and other components. 

Thanks, Ethan! Would you be able to post your "guesses" in a clear list, or table?
