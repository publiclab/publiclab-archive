Hi [@anan12](/profile/anan12)! I really like your approach on dividing the topics into bullet points for better readability. Just a few questions that I mentioned [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/Getty/03-26-2019/outreachy-proposal-publiclab-org-ui-improvements#c23496).

> Can you share with us some code snippets (map integration, tests, etc.) and designs to have a more "in-depth" idea, so that we can visualize things better from your perspective? This will also make your proposal undoubtedly more convincing. These don't have to be much, just the least number of illustrations you believe that clearly communicate the message across.

> How does your model cater to the engaging needs of the newer members of PublicLab, both technical and non-technical?

Thank you for sharing your proposal with us! We are here to help! ðŸŽ‰
