Oops, sorry [@skilfullycurled](/profile/skilfullycurled) I hadn't remembered your last comment on this thread and replied to an inquiry from another contributor looking to implement some pieces of the tag visualization issue: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1502#issuecomment-360310483

I like your suggestion of:

1. only running on the top 256 tags
2. caching weekly

I also responded over there, but I think that with all the work on the API, code cleanup and [outreach](/software-outreach), we could do a daily or weekly cached version of such a query, and be OK with 10-15 seconds total compute time per week. The rest would be run locally in the browser. 

But a key is -- what are the steps to get from a list such as I cited in this comment: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1502#issuecomment-360311857 -- like:

```
["whitebalance", [12476, 13575]], ["wi", [12143, 13067]], ["wi-fi", [11123]], ["width-of-dvd-grating", [12838, 12875, 12895, 12899, 12902, 12926, 12990, 12991, 12995, 12999, 13006, 13014, 13019, 13037, 13046, 13057, 13062, 13069, 13077, 13088, 13089, 13094, 13103, 13117, 13125, 13131, 13133, 13136, 13152, 13154, 13157, 13159, 13169, 13178, 13181, 13183, 13188, 13226, 13248, 13283, 13302, 13305, 13308, 13315, 13316, 13340, 13349, 13355, 13366, 13401, 13402, 13409, 13414, 13423, 13429, 13432, 13434, 13437, 13439, 13440, 13443]], ["wiki", [9048, 10956]], ["wiki-gardening", [10956]], ["wild", [11707, 11711]], ["wildfires", [14803]],
```
to a visualization like yours, and is this enough information to get there? Thanks!
