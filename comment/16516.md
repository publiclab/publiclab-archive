This is beautiful - it does seem like -- please correct me if i miread -- this is for programming an Attiny, and focuses on Arduino IDE => microcontroller via the hex 2 WAV converter -- whereas WebJack is a web-based (javascript) implementation of an encoder/decoder, with a focus almost entirely on communication with an already-programmed microcontroller.

If this is correct, it seems we may have focused on completely complementary projects, which would be beautiful!

A few thoughts --

1. I'm looking for any info on baud rate or bit rate in the WAV assembly. My thought was that it's possible WebJack could directly generate the audio to program, rather than going through the Arduino IDE. Not instead of, but just as a possible option. 
2. Maybe some integration with the nodejs-based https://github.com/noopkat/avrgirl work... not sure, but at minimum, cloud-based hex generation with https://github.com/noopkat/avr-pizza 

And many other ideas -- thanks so much [@dusjagr](/profile/dusjagr) for clueing us in to this amazing work!
