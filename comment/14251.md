hah! school networks are always a problem.

I posted a note recently on hotspot identification, the first stage of which involved a systematic survey with an optical monitor (like the dylos).  I'm new to the idea, but wondering if these kind of 6-minute "snapshots" of different spots couldn't help pin down where the emissions are going.
