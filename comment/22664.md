Hi Katie! I think this sounds great. Do you think we could use the classroom or a corner of it? It's the only space we have right now that we can really get messy in. Other sessions might need to happen there, but we can make sure that hands on activities get preference in that space! We'll also have use of the auditorium and a second room we can use for sessions. I want to bring copper rods for H2S exploration. Also, microscope activities sound really neat.
