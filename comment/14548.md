Sure. No, it's not a photon count, but it is related -- though the DSLR is attempting to extract data that represents a film negative. To do that, the camera has an internal 'raw-converter' which processes pixel data (photon count) with nearby pixel count, non-linear gain and noise reduction, etc. to get the "best" raw image in a 12-14bit format (jpeg is 8-bit). So the 'count' accumulates for the length of the exposure but is then processed before the 'raw file' data is output. Since there are many sources of image noise, the DSLR's are very helpful in improving the raw output generated from the raw photon count. With a photo-diode array detector for a spectrometer, considerable processing is also required to extract the best signal data -- but that processing is done after the sensor data is collected.
