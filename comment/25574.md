Hey thanks a lot! Your reply is very interesting and so are your [explanations](https://publiclab.org/notes/guolivar/01-08-2018/thoughts-on-low-cost-air-quality-sensors). Here's a ['tear-down'](https://www.mistywest.com/posts/teardown-sensirion-particle-matter-sensor/) of this sensor, and with fantastic explanations. 

As of the PM10, i just received a response from Sensirion which says that they **estimate** PM4 and PM10 based on PM1 and PM2.5 values. This is because due to the rarity of heavier particles (which you also mentioned) the sampling time required for proper PM10 measurements is greater than 5 minutes whereas they wanted PM2.5 to be sampled every 1 second. As per your notes, everything is an estimate, isn't it? 

Now the question arises as to what sort of particle distribution (gaussian, log, smoke specific) is used to estimate PM10 from PM2.5 - it could be different in different geographic locations as well as indoors and outdoors. By the way these sensors are for indoor use (Sensirion email communication) but i must use it for outdoor AQ measurements. As of the calibration, the datasheet and Sensirion responses mention that PM2.5 values are **calibrated using fine potassium salts** - this could indicate a great improvement over biomass stove calibration method? I don't know how well this relates to traffic pollution?

Since you have worked with many such sensors (thanks for the alternatives list) do you think others also 'estimate' PM10 rather than measure it? The physics and statistics of all these sensors will more or less be the same, right?

Thanks again.
