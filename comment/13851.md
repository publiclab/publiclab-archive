The variation in wavelength you're seeing probably is normal variation in the manufacturing process for LEDs. Their wavelength depends on the particular mixture of the semiconductor, which for blue is gallium, indium and nitrogen, and the natural bandwidth of an LED is typically about 30 nanometers, as you can see if you look at the plot (it's measured full width at half maximum, or 0.5 of peak output). Makers of cheap LEDs don't try to produce precise wavelengths, so you need to measure them to see what you get. That's different than fluorescent lamps which have narrow emission lines.

Laser diodes have narrower emission lines, but the cheap ones also vary in wavelength because their main applications don't require high precision. (Green laser pointers do not have the same variation.)
