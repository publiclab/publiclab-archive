Those are nice sharp airplane window shots. I made NBG false color infrared from them and added them to the Infrafilters posts: http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/05-27-2013/infrafilters.  They look great in NGB, including the golf course. I guess the fading NDVI with distance could be Rayleigh scattering increasing the blue content of the blue channel the farther the light has to travel through air.  That would make the blue values larger in the distance, so the NIR-Blue would be smaller and NDVI would decrease with distance.
