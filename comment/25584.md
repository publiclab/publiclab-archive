Wow, thanks once again. Its been many months searching for such information from 'experts' i know locally but none were so clear and responsive. Really appreciate this help!

So its clear now - the only way to make desent sense is to place this Sensirion SPS30 near a reference instrument (as close as legally allowed, i have no money to buy one) and obtain correction factors (which will vary for PM type) for all PM values.

PM sensing is so complicated, but necessary. I know of 2 efforts to create opensource PM sensors 1)  [UC Berkeley](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Build-a-Portable-Accurate-Low-Cost-Open-Sou/)  team and 2) [Federico Pedersini](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325330102_Improving_a_Commodity_Dust_Sensor_to_Enable_Particle_Size_Analysis) (U of Milan). The latter one is very promising because it modifies a regular Sharp dust sensor to achieve good granulometric distribution - which can help identify the type of PM source i guess. Have you come across other efforts or actually built similar opensource PM devices?

Thanks a lot.
