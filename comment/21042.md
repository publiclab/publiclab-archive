[@kelv](/profile/kelv) looking good!

The cards look really nice and nice colours on the sidebar. 

For the header section, I think the text in black is quite hard to read on such a dark background. I would suggest changing the opacity of the background so that it stands out more.

For the filters, I quite like how Reddit does it, they use Hot, New and Best (also Top, Controversial and Rising - but I don't think those are needed here, although you could change Best to Top).
