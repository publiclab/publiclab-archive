How do you make sure the white balancing step is omitted? I tried that myself (see table 3 and figure 5 in my note), but the resulting NDVI values were unreasonable (negative for all targets including vegetation). I’m not sure how to interpret that except for the basic explanation that red pixel values were always higher than blue.

With white/red I meant either white or red (as far as I know, with the Midopt filter, setting WB on surfaces of either of these colours gives similar results).
