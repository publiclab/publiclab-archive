How do you make sure the white balancing step is omitted? I tried that myself (see table 3 and figure 5 in my note), but the resulting NDVI values were unreasonable (negative for all targets including vegetation). Iâ€™m not sure how to interpret that except for the basic explanation that red pixel values were always higher than blue.

With white/red I meant either white or red (as far as I know, with the Midopt filter, setting WB on surfaces of either of these colours gives similar results).
