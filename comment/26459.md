Ooh interesting. Yeah could imagine interesting things related to, say, cleaning products, gas stoves, even paints or dry but treated surfaces... plywood, carpets, all possibly producing VOCs. I guess this calls for some kind of complex but repeatable dance routine to sequence a bunch of interactions with these materials.
