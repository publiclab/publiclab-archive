So the good news: the fishing reel (and bottom half of a rod) plus a two foot balloon is a real fun rig! Did not have any trouble with the ~10lb line that came on the reel itself.

The bad news: the camera is every bit as poor quality as expected. It also has a very narrow field-of-view.


Here's a screengrab from a video (there's no intervalometer mode, and video is same resolution anyway, soâ€¦), the balloon is a decent ways up:

In some ways, the narrow FOV may be alright given the poor resolution but would require some serious software to process into something useful.

I think this holds promise, in a few years when Moore's law has had longer to work on these lightweight cameras. It's ultimately more of a $50 kit though ($5 balloon, $20 rod+reel+line, $25+ for a slightly better camera) and still assumes you'll be able to beg/steal/borrow a small helium tank.
