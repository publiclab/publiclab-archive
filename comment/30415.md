There are several reasons why environmental science is important to everyone. One reason environmental science is important to everyone because it impacts the future of the environment. Two, it is important to everyone because it is potent that we are aware of our surroundings. Three, it helps us understand what is around us and how things work. An example would be what chemicals are in the air, how they get there, how does contaminants get in the water, etc.
