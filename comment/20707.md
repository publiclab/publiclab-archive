Hi, all -- one thing I wasn't able to share on the call but wanted to highlight as being pretty interesting was that some folks in Spain -- the IMVEC collective ([@imvec](/profile/imvec) and [@xose](/profile/xose) among others on PublicLab.org) have built a prototype called OdorLog.com -- and this summer they broadened it to be called CitizenLog.com to think about collecting reports of all different types of air/water pollution. 

It's an interesting site to check out and I'd love to hear what you think (They posted about it here, if you want to reply directly: [#17038](/n/17038))

It has photo uploads and space for other observations. We've been thinking about how these types of reports could also be "forwarded" to different agencies, and in follow-up to the discussion, it could be based on where you are. 

Could be an opportunity to team up or collaborate depending on if it's a good fit, and I would guess they'd be open to making some modifications to better fit to the needs at hand here as well.
