I decided not to drop into the rabbit hole of applying time series analysis to these data. There does appear to be some periodicity present, but I didn't notice an obvious period that could be due to the rotation of the rig. The rig does not rotate at a constant speed (lower tilt angles require fewer photos to be taken) so the periodicity would not be constant anyway. There is also probably noise from several sources, so figuring all of that out requires a serious excursion to mathville.

The noise in this latest dataset is quite acceptable if all you want to know is approximately how fast the wind was blowing. Considering that the sensor was hanging from a kite line which was attached to a kite which was being blown around by the wind I was trying to measure, and that most of the time I was either letting line out or pulling line in, I'm not sure you could ever do better than this result.
