That is correct that a [red filter seems to work much better than a blue filter](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/04-26-2014/mobius-ndvi) in a Mobius. The conversion Jeff cited is just for removing the IR block filter. Adding an internal filter requires another very easy process that [Mathew illustrates here](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/004/063/original/mobius_instructions.pdf). I have worked only with the standard lens. The Rosco red filter and Wratten 25A filter have not been carefully compared but appear to produce similar results. You can [order a little piece of Wratten 25A here](http://www.kaptery.com/products/?f=category&id=20).

I think both the underwater and aerial cases you are making deserve to have optical windows. Clear glass camera filters (Skylight 1A or UV) are very cheap and could be glued/siliconed into a hole in your cases. Then the camera can shoot through the glass. 

[Maybe this is worth a try for the Mobius:](http://www.amazon.com/WITZ-Waterproof-Smartphone-Locker-Clear/dp/B004NY5GO4/)
