Thanks for pinging me. The list [@maggPi](/profile/maggPi) posted looks great and I didn't know most of them. However, I personally like to get some experience before diving in the theory of it all (which is necessary, don't skip it!). One resource I really liked is the [generic OpenCV tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html), very basic and provides a good background of basic tools needed. An additional great resource is [Adrian Rosebrock's blog - PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) where he recently started diving into DL as well. I'd recommend you take time to study CV before DL, this background is valuable.
