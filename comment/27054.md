Hi [@ajg434](/profile/ajg434), thanks for posting this question. For others interested in WebFIRE, here's the website: [https://cfpub.epa.gov/webfire/](https://cfpub.epa.gov/webfire/) 

[@DavidMack](/profile/DavidMack) I saw you mention the EPA's National Emissions Inventory on [this other post about emissions data](https://publiclab.org/n/23798). Would you happen to have any insights into this question about WebFIRE? Thank you!
