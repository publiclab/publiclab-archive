+1 to not putting units on the CSV file.   The 'signal' that this data needs further work/calibration is important and I think well articulated here.

Is it ok to have the temperature sensor inside the bottle, or does it need to be outside? are the lag of the bottle and heat of electronics not a major problem?

Alligator clips are the most likely part to be dislodged in the design. I'd like to see  them replaced with stud rings held down by nuts:

Minor language thing: "water bottle" isn't a very standard size, and water bottle cap threads are of varying sizes.  I think we should specify the cap size we're designing for: "bottles with a standard 28mm cap (found in soda bottles, most water bottles)".

Serious safety thing: 2Li + H2O = Li2O + H2 + trouble.  We should test out whether a sealed bottle with a battery in it that gets water inside doesn't degrade the lithium, produce hydrogen, then produce a low-pressure bottle explosion that throws electronic shrapnel.
