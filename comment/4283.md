following warren's suggestion, I removed the paper and let the gasket serve as the top to reduce the IR reflection from my black body source. The baseline reduction is quite significant and makes the effect more apparent.

I want to point out that I am not saying this is necessarily a problem in all applications or that it needs to be fixed. I feel my best role is to observe and report what I see, and let others work out the priorities, then work together on how improvements might be made.
