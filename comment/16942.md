Hi, I think it's not common because many people find it easier to parse data from a full desktop computer. You might try using a Raspberry Pi which has much of the functionality of a desktop, but I think my own preference would be that if it's already running on a webpage or a full-sized computer, there's not a lot of advantage to transferring it back to an Arduino which is relatively less powerful and harder to work with. But that's just me. As to a solution, you could try sending the data over the serial connection to the Arduino, but that's a bit outside my area of expertise: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Serial
