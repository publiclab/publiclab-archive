In terms of groups working on the issue of abandoned land mines, I found a Pennsylvania-based group (they operate mainly using Facebook it seems, [(3) PA Abandoned Mine Reclamation Community | Facebook)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1437512573158306) that seems to have lots of activity and luck getting attention. They just hosted a conference [(About – 2021 PA ABANDONED MINE RECLAMATION CONFERENCE (treatminewater.com)](http://2021.treatminewater.com/about/) ) discussing topics from water quality monitoring and land remediation to community involvement & education and outreach initiatives. The group also created an open-source GIS database to hold and visualize data called Datashed ([Datashed 3.0 Workshop – 2021 PA ABANDONED MINE RECLAMATION CONFERENCE (treatminewater.com)](https://www.datashed.org/)). This database echoes what I’ve found in trying to grab the attention of aloof regulatory agencies---graphics/data visualization/maps are powerful tools. The EPA has an environmental justice mapping tool called EJScreen [(EJSCREEN (epa.gov)](https://ejscreen.epa.gov/mapper/)) that I have only used in a limited capacity, but it's an easy open-source mapping tool that already has many datasets preloaded (demographic data, environmental justice data, pollutants, etc). You can also load your own data (in the form of shapefiles) into the tool and then layer other datasets on the same map. You could, for example, map the sites of abandoned mines where permit violations and hazards are occurring and then add schools or minority population data. There is even a tool to calculate the distance from one point to another, allowing you to say “this hazardous mine is x distance away from x number of elementary schools.”
