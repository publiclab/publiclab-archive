I'm am having a similar issue here: trying to upload and cal for the 1st time, on a paper spectrometer with a Pixel phone.  No matter if I check the vertical or not I get my image displayed in the calibration as "Calibration01 rotated' above: vertically.  After several unsuccessful attempts I rotated the original jpg on my desk them uploaded that.  This then displayed the spectra horizontally however the lines have severe curves to them which I think is preventing the software from finding/displaying the peaks as I see them; hence, a failed cal.  I'm guessing I need to get the image better centered on my camera lens to get straighter lines, so I'll play with that. (I assume you can look at the images from me, McL, so I won't post them here...)
