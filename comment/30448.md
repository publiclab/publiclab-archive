The current world population is 7,968,543,907 and is rapidly growing it reached 7 billion on October 31, 2011. Due to the fact of environmental science which involves multiple other sciences that studies how the environment affect humans, and their everyday life. From the uses of environmental science, the population is projected to reach 8 billion in 2023, 9 billion in 2037, and 10 billion people in the year 2055. The births this year 88,388,523 even though the number is growing each second the number of deaths this is not too far behind with the number of 37,107,880. The number of deaths may be due to a lot of things like diseases or just dying of old age. Environmental science studies pollution and the main things that humans need to survive are pollute everyday like the water, air, and soil. The soil may be polluted but the number of people who are undernourished is 863,057,153 and this is throughout the whole world. This reason can have multiple reasons behind whether its pollution or people simply just cannot afford it. With the number of people who is undernourished there is 779,820,233 people who does not have access to a safe drinking water source. The deaths caused by water related diseases this year is 531, 299 and growing by the minute. Based on my research environmental science can be very helpful in preventing and decreasing these numbers if people are willing to take a step back from some of the things, they do to help the environment. The problems that occur in the world not only affects humans, but it also affects the plants and animals. We need environmental science because it is an interdisciplinary study that involves sciences like biology, geography, and chemistry which we can use to our advantage to keep our environment safe and to keep people from dying. Though the worlds population is great in number we would have to take a look into to the future and see if the population steadily grows to how predicted to be we still have to think about resources to where eventually at some point there wont be enough for everyone. With the number of resources being limited to not only having to much and being polluted the number of deaths will be greater than the growth of the population.
