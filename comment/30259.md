Hello Noah, I'm tagging the documentation fellows from the other fellowship teams in hopes they can give you some insight, also you can check out their project pages as well at [Game Over Formosa Plastics](https://publiclab.org/wiki/game-over-formosa-plastics) and [The Mountains and Mines Monitoring Project](https://publiclab.org/wiki/the-mountains-and-mines-monitoring-project)
