slight revision: cut out a portion of the box that included a crease, and left a bit of that in place for reinforcement along horizontal axis. I more rigid platform, such as wood or laser cut plastic would eliminate need for this, but just a flat piece of cardboard is a bit flimsy without the corner piece.

But with this one addition, the carboard can be reused after multiple crash landings. Without it it bows. With it it remains rigid.

OTher note:
I cut the lens hole exactly the diameter of the actual lens. On the S100, that mean the function ring, not the lens, itself. In the event of a landing along one of the sides, this should protect the camera from forcefully being dropped into the ground.

My next version of this will involve using the folded portion of the platform to lock secure the camera in place by foling in back like this: /___________\
if that makes any sense.
Anywho, 
the rubber bands around the legs are what slow the impact. I'll take a slomo video later today and put it up so you can see what I'm talking about
