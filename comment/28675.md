Hi, [@patcoyle](/profile/patcoyle), my students will be making their post about their observations  after testing. The camera used was an inexpensive digital camera I don't recall the brand but once I receive our pictures I will post so you can judge the quality. This was our first time mapping and the students were excited to be apart of the experience.
