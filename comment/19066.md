:-) of course you can!

Regarding the leaflet library -- i think it's best to think about it in terms of the inputs and outputs. So the docs would say something like:

```
# begin by instantiating a Leaflet map:
var map = L. ....
# add the additional layers like this:
var peopleLayer = new PLMaps.PeopleLayer(map, peopleUrl);
var mapknitterLayer = new PLMaps.MapKnitterLayer(map);
```

Something like that -- make sense? Then we just have to add a few simple lines to each place we make/use a map. 

Maybe looking at an example of another Leaflet map library would make this even easier, like `addTo(map)` syntax: https://gitlab.com/IvanSanchez/Leaflet.GridLayer.GoogleMutant
