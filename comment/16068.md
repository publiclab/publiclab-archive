Hey [@warren](/profile/warren) It was a pleasure to assist to the inner workings of the lab and really great info to go on with the testings</br>
Definitely I'll post this as a build of the Desktop spectrometer. I'm trying to do it with raspberry pi seeking an autonomous device. Don't know where can I get specifically in relation to the camera. I'm on my first stages of python learning so It's going slow.</br>
Today approaching the laser and cuvette box. As soon as I can I'll post it ;)</br>
