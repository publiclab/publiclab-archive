Hi [@warren](/profile/warren) , [@liz](/profile/liz) , [@stevie](/profile/stevie) !

I would really need your guidance on what `Map related features` should i focus in my proposal ?

Which current issues on Github related to Map integration should i add here ?

Also kindly see my above comment (the big one) on Twitter integration .

Thanks so much ! I really appreciate your help here :)
