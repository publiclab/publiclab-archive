Hey Jeff! Sure I'd be happy to test any LEDs you want to send. I do want to throw an idea your way, I think using the higher wavelength LEDs are still a good idea and here's why, it's easy to design a circuit where you can control the output dc voltage like in a step motor, the concept begin that voltage is relative to wavelength and so we can control that, a lot easier than replacing LEDs all the time. What do you think?
