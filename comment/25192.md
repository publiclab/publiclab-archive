I did this!
Nice work -- this should prove to be useful in facilitating the violations reporting process!
Consider editing "Preparing to Report" slides by separating and enlarging the "Report Form" and "Report Form Guide by using 2 separate slides (all 3 case studies).
Also, there's a typo on slide 10 of the Barron County Case Study.  It should read, DNR vs. DRN.
Thank you for creating this reporting process!
