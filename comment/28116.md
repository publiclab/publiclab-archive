Hi [@jjcreedon](/profile/jjcreedon) thank you for this!  Would this be appropriate for soil conveyed to neighboring properties by wind?  

I think one of the constraints is that the original soil pile is no longer available (it's been moved, and presumably it was restricted access to the public) so it's not possible to do original testing, we *only* have their test results.  There are concerns about it blowing into nearby yards during the period when it was uncovered.  

Do you think this would show up in soil? One thing that RIDOH emphasized  is that because the area is already heavily trafficked, it might be hard to differentiate the source, since PAHs are everywhere anyway.
