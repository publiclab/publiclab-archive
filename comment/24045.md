And finally, I want to encourage you both to try building a completely bare-bones system first; don't sweat about the styling, the different graph types, for the very first prototype. 

1. Just try to get a page where you can input a CSV into a textarea, press a button, and see a simple graph. 
2. Then start to think about how to manage different types of input, like an uploaded file, a URL, vs. a string. 
3. Then start to use your great planning above, to separate out the portion of the code that handles inputs, from the part that filters and standardizes the data, from the part that passes it to a graphing feature. 
4. Then think about how the graphing feature might accept different settings, for different graphs
5. then think about the UI that will help people manage each step in this process!

This is just an overall sketch of how you might approach this. But you've already done a lot of planning, so you're well prepared for this!
