I'm sorry - the tag should be [#gain-control](/tag/gain-control) -- and although I don't have time myself at this point to do a live chat, you could perhaps ask on the [spectrometry discussion list](/lists) and there are lots of people who've used these tools there. Or perhaps if enough people are interested we could do an [open call](/openhour).
