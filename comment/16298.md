Mridul, I have some ideas on how to architect the mapping features. I'm interested in how we might break it out into a general purpose privacy-oriented location choosing interface in JavaScript, and include it into our project that way. Like we've done with the rich editor and inline markdown editor. I'll post some more notes on your proposal later today. Thanks for your interest!

This also allows us to make clearer test suites for how the system should behave. And maybe recruit contributors from other projects who need this functionality in their own work.
