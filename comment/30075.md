Hi [@agarwalisha121](/profile/agarwalisha121), thank you for your proposal! I enjoyed the logo ideas, very cool! The navbar design looks good -- it could even be more compact, all in one line, to save pixel space. 

The sliding effect is very cool, great idea! 

How or where will you fit all the tools that would show up on the toolbar? 

Thanks a lot!
