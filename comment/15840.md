I think the blue hump was something we saw a lot on those SYBA webcams, and believe it was related to a blue LED in the webcam itself, which you can snip off without trouble (snap open the grey webcam enclosure; you can glue/tape it shut again). That was one of the (several) reasons we abandoned that camera, but it's an easy fix. I **think** that's right... it's been a while!!
