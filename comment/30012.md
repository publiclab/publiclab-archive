Thankyou [@mathildaudufo](/profile/mathildaudufo) ! I tried to make the tasks approachable and concrete hence broke them down. 
Also, the two collapsible menus can be integrated into one with a drop-down. If you have a suggestion, I'm more than happy to include it. 
About accessibility,
Yes, I've used colors that are differentiable and impactful fonts ( i.e Poppins ). I did my research on the accessibility part because I realise how important that is. I've made sure to not include any color that strain the eyes. I was inspired by how Figma is so approachable for even new designers, it has a unique and minimalist color pallete that makes it welcoming. For reference ( https://www.figma.com/ ). I've tried to make the application welcoming for all. An extended goal could be to have the welcome modal in various languages ☺️
Thankyou!
