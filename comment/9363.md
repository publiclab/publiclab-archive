I just posted a comment to that article.  thanks for pointing it out:
[@donblair](/profile/donblair)--
the author doesn't seem to understand the terminology in use.  The conclusions are based on a misunderstanding of what PM2.5 actually means 
I posted this comment:

PM2.5 is not the same as 2.5µ. it means particles with a mean aerodynamic diameter of 2.5µ. So a PM2.5 measurement is 50% above 2.5µ and 50% below. it includes 0.5µ particles. The same goes for PM10, it includes 2.5µ particles.
