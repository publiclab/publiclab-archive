Wow! I love where you are headed with this Nick! 

It would be very cool if Lactobacilli or bacteria found in commonly fermented products also broke down formaldehyde because it would be really easy to find it for low cost/DIY projects. 

I used to ferment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_microorganism">EM bacteria</a> for bokashi and have a ton left over that I use as soil amendment, air freshener and something to spray in stinky shoes.  I wonder how well it would work at breaking down formaldehyde when misted in the air...
