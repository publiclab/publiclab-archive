One thing I didn't understand was that they are listing the input light at longer wavelengths than the fluorescence peaks they're looking for. I was under the impression that you could only measure fluorescence at a longer wavelength than the input light, and that's certainly what we've seen using green and blue/uv lasers. Am I perhaps reading it backwards, or is the poster backwards? I'm a little fuzzy-headed today, I admit.
