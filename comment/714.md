Thanks Sara,
Surprised?  Yes, at how bloody long it takes to align, analyse, output, and stitch together the images for EACH panorama;]

Most of this could probably be automated in ImageJ or Fiji.  Until this happens, high resolution NRG or NDVI maps of large areas might be slow to emerge. 

I think my main conclusion is that the IR camera tool works.  With a little bit of obsessive attention to detail, some very meaningful results will be possible.
