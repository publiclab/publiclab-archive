The bedrock under LEAFFEST HQ is Cheshire quartzite, a half billion year old Cambrian metasedimentary rock. It is buried deeply at the house under 100 feet or so of kame terrace and other unconsolidated glacial deposits.

As we walked uphill to the east in the canyon of Halnon Brook, there were gray cliffs on either side of us which were probably Cheshire quartzite. There is a lot of Cheshire quartzite around there, so many of the glacial boulders are Cheshire quartzite.

*Katie braved the ferns to examine the cliffs of half billion year old metasedimentary rock along Halnon Brook. This is probably Cheshire quartzite.*

The base of the waterfall might be near the contact with the next major (and older) bedrock type -- phyllite and metawacke in the Moosalamoo Formation.

*Bryce and Katie inspect the bedrock at the base of the waterfall.*

*The gray metasedimentary bedrock at the waterfall is very finely bedded, and could be phyllite or metawacke. The vein of whitish quartz was emplaced during one of the tectonic events which could have turned the graywacke into metawacke.*

*The fine bedding structure is visible here and there appears to be an unconformity where the sedimentary layers were eroded away at an angle and then more strata were deposited. That all happened before the sediments turned to rock.*

*Only one of us made it to the top of the waterfall. He did not report helpfully on the nature of the bedrock there.*

Below are descriptions of some of the rock types mapped in this area.
