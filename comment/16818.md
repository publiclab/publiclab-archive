I can't tell from the photo what kind of filter your camera has. My guess would be that it is a blue filter, so the red channel would be mostly NIR and the blue channel would be mostly blue. But I can't be sure. Do you have a link to the camera or lens you have? Do you know what white balance settings were used in your photo? If you can't do a custom white balance, taking photos which can be directly converted to NDVI will be difficult. Regardless of filter, both the red and blue channel will have to be exposed well (not over-exposed like the photo here) to get good results.
