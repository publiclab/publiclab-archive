Oh sorry, Justin - do you mean the part about

For that, I think I agree with chris's description if in that context "view" is an export. But if we do things by image-ownership rather than map-ownership, maybe it doesn't matter as much? What about if one person uploads a bunch of images and asks others to help them place them properly? The "anyone can edit" system works well for that. Edit history (again, out of scope for your work) would make that less risky for the uploader.
