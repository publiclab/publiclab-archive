This is a really great post, Dave! 

As for the concentration effects, in addition to quenching, there is also shielding, and there can be another phenomenon (whose name I am forgetting), where relaxing fluorophores can actually excite others if the HOMO and LUMO are close enough. If this sort of chain-reaction fluorescence were occurring, I would expect a broader, or skewed peak with a red tail in the more concentrated samples, but in the 80W90 solutions you have shown, it looks like the less concentrated samples actually have broader peaks and are similarly skewed as the more concentrated samples. 

For sample comparison, we used to use the wavelength at maximum intensity as the primary distinguishing feature. We would normalize the area under the curve and then compare lambda-max, though normalizing the area under the curve did not actually affect the position of lamba-max. Based on conversations that Jeff and I have had about the differences in web cam sensitivities throughout the visible spectrum and especially at band-boundaries, it makes sense that comparing lambda-max wouldn't be appropriate here. However, given your Solux gain-correction (which is fabulous!), that should make lambda-max comparisons relevant.
