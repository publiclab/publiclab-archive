[@warren](/profile/warren), I did my first PR. There was no issue left unsigned in plot2, so I did it in image-sequencer.
Link: https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/pull/195

Now looking for more issues in plot2 or any public lab projects, as you said there we can solve issues in Editor project. It's fun and learning contributing in open-source.
