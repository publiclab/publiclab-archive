Halogens are going to be some of the fullest spectrum you can get, besides the sun.  There are lights designed for photography that often can be purchased with known spectral emissions but I believe these are all just high-power quartz halogens. Bulbs are sold by nominal "color temperature" in comparison to an ideal black body, and if you check with the manufacturer they may provide spectra over the life of the bulb.
the biggest supplier of photo equipment is B&H.  their catalog is easy to browse too:
