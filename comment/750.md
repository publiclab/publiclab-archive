Hey Jeff - that *is* the map I am working on. I have a lot of work to do still, but I also was trying to get that TMS thing going (thank you and Corey for the progress on that ticket yesterday, by the way!) before I started rectifying.

After my outing, I had some personal issues that kept me from following through on my findings, results and improvements...but things are good now & thanks for lighting the fire beneath me with this comment, to finally do so.

Briefly, I believe that the IR data I captured may not be very useful unfortunately - one of the things I learned is that a lower altitude may be necessary. But also, it was early in the growing season. The grape leaves/buds were quite small. And this *was* my first time out - I have much to improve upon. I will document my lessons-learned in length, soon - re: CHDK settings, altitude, etc.

Anyway - here are the photos for anyone to see:
