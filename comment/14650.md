Last week I tried to replicate the circuit of the SoftModem shield. I had not the exact resistor values at hand, so maybe thats why it could not recognize the data correctly. 

Luckily the shield from china arrived yesterday. The link browser â†’ Arduino works fine with the FSK generator script, but modem.js does not, so far. Apparently changing the baud and frequency values as suggested in a [forum post](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=86351.msg667157#msg667157) is not sufficient. I have to look at the code so I fully understand what it is expecting.

I could not get the other direction (Arduino to browser) working yet. Configured with the parameters of modem.js and the demo page opened on the phone, there wasn't any data arriving. I would like to test it with my notebook, but I think the microphone input is broken (even the internal mic is not working and I spend a couple of hours on the PulseAudio configuration...). Next step is getting an adapter cable so I can use an external sound card.
