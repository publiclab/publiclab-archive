Hi Robert,  
In this note and comments we were lamenting the lack of replicate spectra of CFL lamps to confirm the information at the Wikipedia page. It's still startling that there aren't plenty of reliable spectra of CFLs online, but I have not found any to compare to the Wikipedia spectrum.  So it would be really helpful to have a spectrum and data file for a CFL from a well calibrated spectrometer (or two). If the near infrared can be included that would be helpful, so maybe 300 to 1000 nm. It would also be good to have spectra for different types of fluorescent lamps to see if there is a consistent difference among lamp types.

Thanks,  
Chris
