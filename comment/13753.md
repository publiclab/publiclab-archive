One more thing to consider is that our DVD diffraction gratings would probably filter out most of the UV light below about 390 nm, even if we had a sensor that could detect it. A lot of sunglasses are made out of polycarbonate (the same material in DVDs) because it is good at filtering UV light.

If you look at this graph from [an oculists website](http://www.oculist.net/downaton502/prof/ebook/duanes/pages/v1/v1c051d.html), the transmission of light through polycarbonate drops off sharply below about 390 nm.
