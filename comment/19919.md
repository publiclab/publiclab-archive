node: Why do raw RGB values differ from calibrated RGB values? I thought calibration just set pixels to wavelength (nm)?

So, to clarify: what I'm saying is that there seem to mathematical artefacts in the calibrated intensity values. This means that at least for exported csv files, point 2 above is not quite right. The changes to raw intensity are small but I can't figure them out (tried to fish around for the code, but couldn't find that part). So I think this leads to the conclusion there is small bug with unknown consequences (output of code differs from intent), and it will be best remove the calibrations and use raw values when exporting and processing data for quantitative purposes?
