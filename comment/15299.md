Hi Gretchen,  
These are excellent categories. This is really well thought out. I tried it out (so maybe category:verify?) on some of my notes:  

https://publiclab.org/tag/category:build  
https://publiclab.org/tag/category:verify  
https://publiclab.org/tag/category:test-limits  
https://publiclab.org/tag/category:observe  
https://publiclab.org/tag/category:field-test  
https://publiclab.org/tag/category:experiment

Applying the categories to actual research notes takes some careful study. Deciding between Verify, Observe, and Test-tool-limits can be tricky. The other categories are easier. Is it valid to use more than one category for a single research note?  Many of my notes could use two or three. 

The Observe category seems easily confused with the Field-test category. I'm not exactly sure what the intent of the Observe category is. Maybe the Verify and Test-tool-limits categories should be combined because many people will probably confuse them. Maybe Observe should go in with those two?

Another question is whether these categories will be used only on notes about official Public Lab tools, or could also be used on any related tool that somebody reports on. It might get confusing if people used these categories to tag random things they were working on.

This is cool,  
Chris
