There are three different types of symbiotic relationships in the animal kingdom: mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. Mutualism meaning both partner’s benefit. An example of a mutualistic relationship between the catfish and the tilapia. Obligate symbiosis is a symbiotic relationship that both organisms need to survive. Catfish and Tilapia mutualistic relationship. This is because the cleaner fish eats harmful parasites and other small sources of food from the large fish. This gives the cleaner fish a meal, the larger fish is helped because it no longer has these parasites on them. Parasitism is a branch of symbiosis where one species benefits from the relationship to the detriment of the other as in the case with dogs and flees. An example of communalism is when tree frogs use plants as protection. All these relationships contribute to the welfare of each ecosystem and environment. Any interruptions of these relationships at even the smallest levels can adversely affect an ecosystem and an entire environment.
