Thank you so much for posting this! I purchased a couple of VOC detectors over the last week and wanted to know how the off-brand VOC detectors fare in accuracy and your response is so very helpful.

When I have used portable, industrial VOC meters (ppb) in the past, I doubled up instruments because since there is a loss of accuracy the further one goes without calibration (using gas canisters). It seems that 2-monthly calibration worked best when those instruments were in regular use. Is it correct to assume that the Adafruit and other CCS-811 VOC sensors do not need regular calibration or initial calibration, as they use a different technique and not laser-scattering?
