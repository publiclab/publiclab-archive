McMaster Carr sells aluminum strips 1/16" thick in widths between 1 1/2" and 2" (in various lengths). So a one foot long piece would cost less than $2.00: http://www.mcmaster.com/#4490t131/=10a2izj

I'm not sure that material would be strong enough for this design, but something similar should work well. This rig could also be suspended from a Picavet.
