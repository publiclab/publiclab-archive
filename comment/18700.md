Hi, [@Raounak](/profile/Raounak) - once you have a chance, it would be great to see a small contribution to ensure you know our workflow -- and it's very valuable experience for you as well!

We're happy to help you take the first step!

You may also want to coordinate with [@mridulnagpal](/profile/mridulnagpal) about the geographic APIs we are discussing in that proposal -- maybe there's opportunity to team up! https://publiclab.org/notes/mridulnagpal/01-22-2018/leaflet-blurred-location
