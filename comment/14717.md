Hi Chris,

Just made a couple changes to the Saturn V model and they should be all updated to Thingiverse. 

[![Tray_Assembly_Close_Up.png](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/016/516/large/Tray_Assembly_Close_Up.png)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/016/516/original/Tray_Assembly_Close_Up.png)

Are these the correct components and is this what you were looking for? I also need to add the washer and cotter pin to the Picavet shaft which I will update soon.

Thanks,
Ranon
