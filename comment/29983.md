 On worldometer, we are shown the current population, number of deaths and births per day and so far this year. Using this data we were able to calculate that there is about 2 births for every death.

After watching the video, it is evident that the world population is increasing an  exponential rate rather than a constant one. It took the human population 125 years to go from 1 billion to 2 billion. But now the human population is increasing by another billion every 15 years.
