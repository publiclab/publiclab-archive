audio cd drives run at 3.5 revs per second and come up to speed very quickly. the speed is regulated by a servo loop. by putting multiple holes in a CD you should be able to come up with a filter that runs at the right rate.

this basic technique has been used to measure color since the '20s 

you can put several different filters in the wheel to do spectroscopic imaging
