The nir instruments are heavily used in agriculture. The company I worked for wanted to use Near Infra-Red (reflectance), also called NIRR, to determine the plasticizers present in PVC. The common methods used were GPC, soxhlet reflux, and other messy methods. The company selling the instrument came in to help us separate the individual components in the NIRR.  This was with powdered samples.  The major components were PVC, dioctyl phthalate, and epoxidized soybean oil.  When dealing with the NIR, it's often overtones of the infra red being used.  That can lead to interesting math.  Some of the plots included first derivative and second derivative plots. While the math worked, there were intercompany problems.  The instruments and methods never got used.  That's just to give you an idea of what you may be dealing with. But, many people have gotten these type of instruments to work on this application.  A starting point might be looking for NIR instruments and seeing how they can be simplified.  Or looking at the NIR instruments used in agriculture.  Good luck.
