Here are some helpful databases to look for information.

Information specific to any individual,  community, or workplace would require a systematic and detailed assessment about history, context, other patterns over geography and time of the exposures and health co-occurring health concerns. This helps determine what can or should be prioritized. This type of needs assessment usually requires financial support to complete in a meaningful way.

It may also help to let us know the specific goals for using the information? Multiple health outcomes could be plausibly linked to supporting scientific literature from research in other contexts, but the strength of supporting those associations are relevant to this situation may require some extra work and detail. Some initial helpful questions may include: Have employees or workers most commonly exposed expressed concerns about their health or the application process as well? Are there health providers or public health officials who have (without prompting) noted suspicious patterns that come up in their routine clinical practice?

Public labs has some crowdsourcing tools they are partnering to develop to share and map exposures and health outcomes that may be helpful to this community moving forward.
