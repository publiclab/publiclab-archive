I used some of Gregor's material to respond to this post on the Google Summer of Code discuss list, from a student who's new to open source: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-summer-of-code-discuss/Uup7tO3wovg

Worth a look at their original post, for one perspective on what it's like to jump into open source contribution! Thanks Gregor!
