[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) is certainly correct in his comments that each of the purple air devices reads, in general, higher than the Grimm. (Almost all slopes (coefficients of the "x" variable) in the regression equations are less than one. But [@Cbarnes9](/profile/Cbarnes9) question specifically refers to PM10 and the SCAQMD specifically calls the PM1 and PM2.5 data "quite accurate" while not using the same description for the PM10 data.

In addition because [@Cbarnes9](/profile/Cbarnes9)  categorizes the PM10 bias as "so high" I would assume that he/she considers the "amount" of bias for PM10 as considerably different than that for the other sizes. To help answer the original question I would think one needs to understand why.
