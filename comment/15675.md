Sorry to hear about the short lifespan of your timelapse deployment. Tony did some trials with the Mobius last spring and learned that it has a battery saving mode which turns off power to the camera between shots. This mode is applied whenever you set the timelapse interval to be longer than five minutes. So at an interval of six minutes between photos, the Mobius battery will last about 10 days (maybe longer) at room temperature. The battery will probably perform worse outside in the cold. These results are described here: https://publiclab.org/notes/tonyc/03-22-2016/using-mobius-camera-as-a-trap-cam-in-field-deployments. With an interval of five minutes or less, the camera stays powered up continuously and the battery will last only a few hours.

The trail camera also has smart power management and can last for months on one set of batteries. Some research or testing might be required to figure out how to get the most out of it. One issue is that it can take night photos using infrared LEDs to illuminate the scene. This uses lots of battery power but will not illuminate anything more than 10 m away. For your application it will be important to disable the IR LED feature, or just take photos during daylight hours.
