Not sure if that helps or not. Here is a fundamental question I'm unclear about. Knowing that the diffraction lines on the DVD are parallel to the rim, should the slit be parallel or perpendicular to the rim? (To be clear, I consider "parallel" to mean along a tangent to the rim, and "perpendicular" to be along a radial line from the rim to the center of the DVD.) Also, does it matter which side of the dvd (the clear part, after splitting it) is nearest the slot? Finally, where should my eye be? Right next to the opening of the spectrometer, or at a distance?
Thanks. I'll take some pictures and post them if the answers to these questions don't help.
