[@camilochiang](/profile/camilochiang), 
Yes, you are correct that with a blue Rosco filter, the photo captured by the converted camera is (more or less) NGB. I think the diagram you are referring to is this one:
.  
[![5396083368_8d8e441daa.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/021/medium/5396083368_8d8e441daa.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/021/original/5396083368_8d8e441daa.jpg)  
.  
That diagram attempts to show how false color IR images are made from *two* camera IR systems (with both IR converted and unmodified cameras). The result is an image referred to as NRG because channels have been swapped so N, R, and G data are displayed with the colors R, G, and B. 

It is not possible to make an NRG false color IR image from the photo from a single camera (Infragram) system with a blue filter because the red channel is used to capture NIR so no visible red data is captured. You can make a similar false color IR image with a blue filtered infragram by using blue data instead of red. These look generally similar because NIR data is displayed as red, and the G and B data are displayed as colors other than themselves. These images could be referred to as NBG. Here is an example from this note: http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/12-08-2013/root-crops

.  
The abbreviations I use for the false color IR images are different because I was trying to indicate that some of the visible channels are so contaminated with NIR light that we should acknowledge that. But that just makes it so confusing that little useful information is transferred to most people.
