D5 appears to connect the INT/SQW on the RTC to PD5 on the CPU. I would be very interested in how one uses the feature. I'm assuming that it requires configuring the DS3231 and writing code that enables the CPU to respond to the signal. I am a novice with ATMEL chips but would be willing to test any algorithms that are proposed.
