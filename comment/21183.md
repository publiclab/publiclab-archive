Hi Jeff - I wasn't sure if you mean varying over time or over the surface. Over time both will vary but from my experience they seem fairly stable over time if protected from light. Archive (low acid?) paper might be more stable. As far as being consistent over the surface I think both are reasonably consistent. Lens distortions or uneven illumination will likely be the biggest causes of varying pixel values over the surface. Keep in mind I haven't tested these claims. One issue you will need to deal with if you are calibrating with a black and white target is to make sure the bright pixels are not saturating (e.g., pixel value of 255).
