It also occurred to me that you could start by making a page which displays existing maps without allowing users to save any changes to them, or perhaps even to manipulate them (at first). A static map display page which nonetheless uses Leaflet. 

Once you accomplish this, you could add a button such as "Edit" which enables users to begin to manipulate and/or upload new images. Anyways I'm getting really excited about this proposal! Great work so far!
