I ran my working circuit for over 45 minutes on a single fresh 9v battery, so that seems workable. But my other circuits continue to cause trouble. 

I did figure out that if I move the 555 timer itself between boards, i can get the others to light up properly... but even with the fresh 9v the relays won't actually trigger, just the light blinks.

Frustrating. I wonder if I fried components (the 555 or otherwise) while trying different battery combinations. But my original circuit works great. I'll see about making a couple more circuits for extra data points.
