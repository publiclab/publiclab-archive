Hi [@pdhixenbaugh](/profile/pdhixenbaugh) 
I finally got some time to look at both schematics. The Analog Devices one is ~ 3x as many parts adn [@bhickman](/profile/bhickman) design, although both of these schematics are missing the power supply sections, and the AD one is more complicated, it requires more voltage rails, so the complexity is going to go up more. From an accuracy point of view, AD goes through an analysis of the measurement accuracy, so from an expense point of view, the design based on the AD design will be more expensive, but possibly more accurate.

From a DIY point of view, starting with a fabricated board, there are more components, so more work and more money to build with the AD design.
