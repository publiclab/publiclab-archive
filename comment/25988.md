This is a really interesting question! I know that the plantower sensors are affected by vapor, humidity, aerosols, though how comparable those results are to other kinds of particulate matter I can't say ( but I'm sure someone else can). I did a very quick online search for "vaping and PM 2.5" and it does seem like some of the vaping products would produce vapor that is at least the right *size* to get picked up by the sensor-- they *definitely* get triggered in the presence of smoke , but am curious if non-smoking related bathroom activities might also set these off. If you set up an experiment we'd love to see the results!!
