Hi, ZhanLiangUF - thanks for your proposal! A few questions:

> geocoder

what about doing this on the client side, using the geocoder API? See https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/blob/master/app/views/map/_new.html.erb#L46-L74

I'll repeat my comments from the proposal posted by [@jiteshxyz](/profile/jiteshxyz) --  

> Another question -- how does this work with JavaScript libraries that we use? I'm wondering because we're probably going to break out the editor into a separate module, in its own repository. Would it then be necessary to internationalize that independently? And what about JavaScript in our own site, how is that managed if it inserts English text?

> This is a big, and ambitious project. I hope that it can be done in stages, so that rebasing and merging does not become very difficult. Perhaps just the header could be internationalized for starters. 

Also, some other students have gone through some small bug fixes to demonstrate that they're comfortable with the Contributor Guidelines and with creating and working with pull requests. Actually contributing before the program starts is of course not necessary, but it's nice to know people have read the docs and are prepared to issue pull requests. Perhaps if you did so for a very small change, just to demonstrate that you're comfortable with the process, that'd be helpful to us to know. 

Thanks!
