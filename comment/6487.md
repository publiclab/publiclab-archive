Hi Warren,
Thanks for the kind comment. I havnÂ´t uploaded it yet, when I upload my spectral images somehow they get strangely comressed and the lines look very short and wide. I am not sure what I am doing wrong. Will work on uploading one of these images one way or the other in the next few days to come. I am thinking if there is a way to have the computer recognize the Canon IXUS as a webcam?
