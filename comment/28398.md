[@rachelb](/profile/rachelb) - great question! Is there a specific type of pollution you're concerned about and/or want to learn more about? I see you listed Lake Pontchartain - is this a place you are familiar with and visit? Have you noticed any observations there that would indicate some of your pollution concerns like trash, algae, or others?

I know that where I live, stormwater runoff is a major pollutant for our freshwater systems. Plus medical waste (prescription medication chemicals as one example) that make it into our water bodies instead of the proper medical waste disposals.
