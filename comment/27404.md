Hi [@mkay6123](/profile/mkay6123) ! You might find the [microplastics wiki page](https://publiclab.org/wiki/microplastics) helpful in finding ways to get involved. For example, you could post or answer a microplastics-related question, try an activity, or browse the other material on the page and see what could be expanded upon?
