Ah, one more idea -- the web UI for adding new steps is a little bare, no? We could build that out so you can see the description of modules and read more about them before adding them, and also maybe so you can look through the available ones more easily?

[@ccpandhare](/profile/ccpandhare) -- thanks, and also want to say your summer's work was heroic, we always knew there was too much to do in a summer, so I'm so glad we may get a chance to build on it this summer. Thanks for your input!

(btw i'm sure you've linked to the GPU issues already but there is some good info on how we might 1. get GPU processing in Node.js as well as 2. have modules clearly indicate if they require GPU (i.e. web only) vs. ones that work in node AND browser. I think there's some space for this as long as modules are clear about it)
