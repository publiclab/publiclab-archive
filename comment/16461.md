Great.... For the accurate dense reconstruction with my mobius setup with wide angle lens, i have figured out best way.  There is no option to work out with the shutter speed so i have made a mission plan with a speed of 9 m/s and i take timelapse every 5 sec which would be sufficient for getting good overlap. For, vibration removal i have setup something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuNhiJAVum0
I will also be taking two flights one after another, where i will maintain exactly perpendicular flight direction with +- 20 m change in altitude between the flights. This would help me in getting accurate stiching of multiple images (~ 90 images).  After some pre and post calibration i think i will get better results with wide angle A lens mobius.

I will test this configuration and share my results in public labs.

Thank you Chrish. You guys are wonderful and passionate.

Cheers public labs team
