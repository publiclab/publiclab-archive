Hi [@TUtam](/profile/TUtam),
I am not entirely up on this project but am somewhat familiar with Processing and am wiling to help.  I downloaded the WheeTrometer GUI software and have found that there are a few things that are not working in Processing 3 (the newest version).  I like the newest version and do not recommend going back to older versions.  Anyway, there are some libraries that are required to make this run.  One is controlP5, another is grafica.  To import a library, open Processing, click on the "sketch" dropdown, then "import library", then "add library".   There is another library(.com.shigedoyo) that I have not figured out yet.  
It appears that the shigedoyo library is needed to run multiple windows, or frames.  I am not sure that these windows are really necessary to get the spectrometer running.
By commenting out the lines of code that call the shigedoyo library and making some other changes, I have been able to get the GUI to display but I have had to comment out a bunch of code and I am not sure it is running correctly right now.  If you contact me at summers(at) wcu dot edu I will send you the code and keep you updated as I get stuff working.
Best,
Jack
