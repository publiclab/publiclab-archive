 You can see a little more about lift here:

https://publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping-regulations

the balloons we sell are 5.5' across, so their lift is closer to 5lbs. 

Bigger kites (or multiple kites on a line-- look into "kite train") can have a lot more lift (the exact lift will depend a bit on the wind). 

Have you seen AirPup? [@mathew](/profile/mathew) might be able to give you more info about this option-- AirPup is a kite/balloon hybrid that can provide lift for heavier loads:
