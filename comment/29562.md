A better approach would be Uv/ vis.  Phenols, such as BPA, absorb at about 280 nm.  So you would set up an extraction to pull out the BPA and run a UV/vis on it.  The trouble is, there are many other additives to plastic compounds that can absorb in that same range.  The usual way this is solved in industry is to do extractions and inject into a GC/MS.  Hope this helps.
