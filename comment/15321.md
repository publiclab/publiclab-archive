Yes, I meant to be a little harsh. I think dictating the style of the titles of research notes is a big step. It could be the correct thing to do, but it has some issues:

1. Most note posters might do a rather bad job making titles that are useful for the greater purposes that you would like them to be useful for.
2. There are other ways to accomplish the same thing, like a second "subtitle" or "description" field (e.g., title: Making Aerobee, subtitle: Making the aluminum frame of an aerial camera rig (video). Many users will get this wrong too.
3. There is a long tradition in publishing of making titles clever or catchy. It happens today in many respectable periodicals (e.g., The Economist). This can be taken too far (HUMA CUTS WEINER OFF, might be excessive), but allowing some creativity can enliven the pages of publiclab.org.

Full Disclosure: Titles of my research notes include "Tales from the Cryptogam," "Graze Anatomy," and "Orange is the new red." Imagining that these caused a (very) few people to smile made posting a better experience for me.
