Matt,

I always use swivels because they are so convenient for hooking and unhooking the gear. Another advantage may be that they actually swivel and thereby untwist the kite line that gets twisted when it is wound in hand over hand (one twist per winding). I am not convinced that swivels swivel enough to unwind the windings. My kite line is always twisted.

The primary swivel controversy is whether they are safe to use. Some serious kite flyers never use them because they can fail, and use knots instead. I compromise and only use really good swivels, never the kind with the piece of sheet metal, always the wire type. And I use big ones, even though smaller ones are rated high enough.

I don't think swivels will have much effect on kite movement.

But back to lists, if you had put two spaces at the end of each line of your bulleted list, I think it would have started each item on a new line. Two spaces is a carriage return in markdown. Let's see if it works:  
item 1  
item 2  
item 3  
item 4
