Do you know how well synchronized the photo pairs are? Do you have to start them both taking photos at the same time, or synchronize their clocks?

Wratten 87 is not included in the filter pack. If you can find somebody who once used color film, they might be able to find a black piece of film at the end of a roll. After development, color slide film is black if it has not been exposed to light, and color print film is black if it has been exposed to light. Either can be mostly opaque to visible light but pass most NIR.
