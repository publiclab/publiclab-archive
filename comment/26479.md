Please separate the design details from the implementation details. Example: Bulk Moderation is a high-level design while the Daily Digest is fine grain implementation. Solution: Divide it into 2 parts - Design and implementation. Write just the approach which you want to discuss in the design with er diagram/flow chart/dfd/ui/ux/mock ups etc. While in the implementation details write the core implementation details. Reason for this type of categorical arrangement: Many folks at PL are non-coders so they will be willing to help you, the design part is for them. Developers look at both.
