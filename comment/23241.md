Hello team,

The first version of the new welcome page design is ready. I would really love it if you could tell me what you think ([@warren](/profile/warren), [@liz](/profile/liz), [@stevie](/profile/stevie), and everyone else!) 😃 

The design can be found here: https://edieblu.github.io/pl-welcome.io/

I've based my design on Jeff's template, but after spending some time researching (and reading your annual reports, ha ;), I've also added and changed some things. 

Please know that this is early days and I have absolutely no problem re-doing entire parts of the page if that's needed. 

I still have a couple of questions:

1. who exactly are we sending to this page and what is the outcome we want to achieve? I know it's newcomers, but how much do they know about public lab? Why are we telling them to sign up? Is this their first interaction with publiclab?

2. there's a section of the page called "Find a cause" that I've added. I've chosen the three causes: air pollution, plastic waste, water pollution because they seemed most popular (most often tagged). Does anyone have a more precise way of measuring this? 

3. given that the site's tagline is "DIY environmental science community" I believe that we should feature the tools and kits somewhere as well. If you have any ideas, please let me know. 

4. I've done minimum css, haven't added the custom font etc, that will all come once we agree on the layout of the page :) 

Let me know what you think! :)

Thank you,

Eva
