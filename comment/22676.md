Hi again,
I'm going to put in an amazon order for materials on Tuesday. If you put a list together of materials you think you'd need but you don't want to schlep down, I can try to add them to this order. Microscope stuff, RPis, cardboard... I think you can put a cart together on amazon and send it to someone right? That would be awesome.
