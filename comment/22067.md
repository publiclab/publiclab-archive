 Parsing the CSV on the Server side is not a good idea. Suppose there are 100 or 500 or more users who are using this new feature at a time. Then parsing of these 100csv would make lots of loads on the server instead we have a distributed load on the client computers in the client side. And also this will not only create load on the server but it will also have delay response to the user. Let suppose there are 500 users who have submitted the parsing request simultaneously then the last csv's user has to wait for all the csv to parse which will cause in the delay in response.  Also, we should not depend upon the rails for it. We should build a standard independent js library which can directly be included in any project via CDN or npm modules or yarn. And can be just activated by using id of div and calling a function.
