If bubbling room air through an aquarium removes some dust from the air (including some silica dust) then growing diatoms in the water is not required. The silica dust will be  trapped in the water and can be disposed of (I guess silica is dangerous to us only when it is suspended in the air). The trick is to force a room full of air through the water every hour or so, so a floor to ceiling tube (e.g., 4" PVC pipe) might be more appropriate than an aquarium. If the bubbling will not remove the finest particles, some other method will be needed to remove those particles. That other method might also remove all the larger particles, so the bubbling may be superfluous.

If you want to test whether diatom growth is stimulated by silica removed from the air which bubbles through water, then:

1) determine that there is silica dust in your air,  
2) establish that diatoms will grow in your aquarium,  
3) establish that diatom growth is stimulated by added silica (a separate experiment),  
4) grow diatoms in two similar aquaria,  
5) bubble air through both aquaria,  
6) filter the air that enters one of the aquaria (so no dust enters that aquarium),  
7) quantify the amount of diatom growth in each aquarium,  
8) replicate the experiment until you have some confidence that your result is real.
