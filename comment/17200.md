So after the [Open Call](http://pad.publiclab.org/p/opencall), we had a few behavior ideas that could use a `scheduled` behavior:

```
**Tagging Bot** "I see this is a question about 'balloon mapping' -- would you like me to try to reach out to some people who've offered to help on this topic?"
- ensure the bot hasn't already left this message
- leave this only if the question hasn't been answered for a day

**Tagging Bot** "Would you say this post is most about ____? Click here to tag it to make it visible to more people following that topic."

**Recruiting answerers Bot** (JW) Look at recent posts. If someone has posted more than once on a given tagname/topic "particulate-matter" -- 
Bot: "Hi, I noticed you've posted twice now about 'particulate-matter'. People often come to Public Lab asking about that. If you're able to help answer questions about it, click here, and we'll send you an email if someone asks about 'particulate-matter' in the future. 3 other people have already agreed to help."
- ensure they're not already signed up this way. The link would be https://publiclab.org/subscribe/tag/question:balloon-mapping for example
- ensure the bot hasn't already left this message
```
