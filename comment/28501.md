Thanks a lot [@warren](/profile/warren) for this amazing feedback. Yes, I do think that making reversible changes is worthwhile with up/down workflow. It is extremely convenient to just rails db:rollback if migration doesn't happen as expected or we make a mistake. We will definitely face such instances where the migration does not happen as desired by us and thus just doing a rollback will save a lot of time. Worst case scenario, we will have DB snapshots with us, to recover the DB state but for most cases having a up/down workflow will suffice.
Talking about the answer to comments migration, I will change the timeline and the implementation to accommodate for the work that is already done in this regard. Thanks again!
