Hi all, i had a good question on DM in Gitter chat I wanted to share:

>  does it mean that to effect changes on the publiclab.org/post (online editor) we only make code contributions to the publiclab/plots2 repo and not publiclab/publiclab.Editor repo?

Hi, actually it's the other way around - first changes are made to `PublicLab.Editor` (https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor/), then it's published on the NPM registry at https://www.npmjs.com/package/publiclab-editor
then it will be pulled in via the semantic versioning matching rules (https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning/) into `plots2` then published to the live site
there are a number of steps along the way but that's the flow.
good question!

and, the HTML is on publiclab.Editor's examples folder, but then those HTML changes (if any) have to be copied into the real code in plots2. But HTML changes are relatively rare because they are usually by definition breaking changes if they require a "downstream" library to change in order to remain compatible with the new version of the Editor library.
