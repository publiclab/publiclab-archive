Hi! thank you so much for your proposal! 

On `1. Refine the custom translation helper ` a few thoughts I had were:

1. we do this in both JS and Ruby, i believe - that is, the `i18n` gem has a translation helper in each, and i believe we've overridden the Ruby one (using `translate()` now instead of `t()`), but we should think on how to do this in JavaScript as well! If it's simple and well written enough, we can just port over the code so both work normally.
2. we might want to run similar tests on both the JS and Ruby versions
3. for the display issues where the globe is showing up oddly, i wonder if we might want to consider a different display. What if we instead added a `.......` dotted underline to words that needed translation, and when you hover over with the mouse, a globe icon appears? This might be easier to format. However, if there is already a hover-over popover or tooltip, we'd have to ensure that the new one doesn't interrupt it or overlap it. 

Thanks! I'm going to copy these comments into the main discussion issue too so everyone can reflect on these ideas!
