Well, both images were taken from the same device within about 20 minutes, so you can check their images against one another even if they're not accurately calibrated:

As to the reference spectrum in the calibration tool, I used the corrected snowsky spectrum you posted in the comments of this note: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-30-2015/new-wavelength-calibration-procedure-preview-for-spectral-workbench-2-0

So if you have a reference spectrum you're more confident in now, all I need is the image plus a list of the peaks and troughs as shown here: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/spectralworkbench/SpectralWorkbench.API.Core.js#L521

And I could update the calibration code.
