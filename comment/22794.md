We'll be posting more on this soon, but the very first steps are to be sure your project is posted on PublicLab.org on a wiki page -- like these examples:

* https://publiclab.org/wiki/coqui
* https://publiclab.org/wiki/timelapse

The page should have:

* a brief intro
* a list of parts, prices, and links
* a [Questions section](/wiki/activities#Questions+grids)
* an [Activities section](/wiki/activities) with at least an introductory "getting started" activity posted

There's a good template on the [Wiki Templates page](/wiki/wiki-templates) -- the "Method Template Light":

<a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" href="https://publiclab.org/wiki/new?n=14552&title=Your%20kit%20name%20here&tags=community-kits,new-community-kits">Start using the template here</a>
