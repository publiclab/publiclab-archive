[@yamanoorsai](/profile/yamanoorsai)  The fidget spinner sounds like a really cool project. Would you have any interest in sharing your process here in a research note? I'm guessing there would be folks who might like to try their luck building one (and might be able to help troubleshoot the spinning issue!).
