https://publiclab.org/profile/ethanbass - Thanks for your comments. As to your last note about my final plot: What I see is the depth of the "notch" between the 405nm source and the fluorescence broad peak; relative to the broad peak. The LED plot "notch" is not nearly as "deep" as the "notch" in the laser based spectra. I see this as evidence of the sever influence the LED's broad spectra has on the fluorescence spectra -- and worse yet, it is difficult to subtract out the source spectra while keeping resulting errors low. (Also, I see a significant difference in the "shape" of the two fluorescence spectral peaks -- which I consider to be important from a potential analysis perspective.) You're right though, that the broad fluorescence "shape" is roughly similar. However, I'd like to see sufficient control and stability of the hardware to actually extract more data from the fluorescence spectra than just general shape or peak center.
