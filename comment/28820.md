Found something.It's a YouTube post by chem_talk on neodymium.  It's a long way from complete, but according to the post, this rare earth isn't rare.  And it shows a spectrum ( it's in the early part of the post)on absorbance, and florescence, both of which show good bands.  The post is titled "neodymium compound, colors, and magnets". Still a lot of distance to go... But the video is a start. And neodymium magnets are relatively easy to find.
