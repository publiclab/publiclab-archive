> Hello everyone !  I along with my two friends conducted a meetup in our college yesterday regarding how to start with open source contributions and how Summer of Code and outreachy can be a great motivation.  I also discussed about our organisation Public Lab, what we do and how we have achieved such a great number of new comers in such a few days. I discussed various projects under our organisation and spread some words about my contributions so that they can also be a part of the project. Here is a link to some of the photos we clicked :[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19kFaC33iGz91Qs0PD3F4cS8wmeK\_htV7?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19kFaC33iGz91Qs0PD3F4cS8wmeK_htV7?usp=sharing)  [@jywarren](/profile/jywarren), [@tech4GT](/profile/tech4GT), [@bansal](/profile/bansal)\_sidharth2996, [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano) and all other contributors please do have a look.
