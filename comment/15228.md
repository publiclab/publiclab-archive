Thanks Jeff for your appreciation! You have been greatly helpful for me as well as other students throughout the summer. You have been working so hard along with us! Its been great working you and the whole Public Lab team. And to mention I really like the spirit of collective work Public Lab has. I got the feedback and response not only from the GSoC team but also from others in the community and it really feels great to see everyone involved. This has helped me learn a lot and I have a lot of experience contributing to open source now! Yes I too hope to contribute more to Public lab in future. In fact I am learning to contribute to the Rich Editor and hope to see its launch soon! Thanks again and excited for the September Open hour!
