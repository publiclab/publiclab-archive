I tried with a photo from a PowerShot S100. That's the only camera I have other than the Mobius that has a fairly wide angle lens (24mm equiv.). But the firmware in the S100 corrects for distortion, so the photos are pretty square. I think I was able to make it more square with Fx=0.01 and Fy=0.02, but it won't matter much for stitching mapping photos.

I did not figure out how to save anything. I did figure out that you can make micro adjustments in the parameters by holding a mouse click on a slider and using the arrow keys on a keyboard. That's a nice feature.
