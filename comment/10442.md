Seth,

Fantastic!!  Thanks so much for this -- super exciting!
Maybe you and Bryan and Jeff Walker and I can schedule a Hangout or something sometime soon just to chat through the various neat options / ideas?

- Bryan and Jeff Warren have already been sketching out an API for submitting research notes, I think ... 
- I'm learning that a lot of researchers who do supercool environmental stuff seem to be using R, and RStudio, so it'd be great to chat about how markdown / asciidoc play nicely with that setup ...
- Another cadre of researchers are into iPython, and use it in a similar fashion to RStudio ...
- J-Walk pointed me to the http://jupyter.org/, which aims to extend both iPython and RStudio into some awesome hybrid ...
- My as-yet-clumsy reading on all of this is that the approach you're taking is flexible enough to handle a bunch of formats and generate research notes as flat files on github that can easily be sucked into plots2 somehow (if that's a cool idea vis a vis Bryan, J-War, and the other devs) ...
- Clearly, good fun is to be had, here.
- Woohoo!
