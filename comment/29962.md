As a group, we believe this project was really enjoyable. Our group learned more about microplastics than ever before,  we used our creative skills to make eye-catching posters, and we made a bottle that represents how our sewage and water systems are impacted by microplastics, everyday materials, etc. eventually ending up back into the food we eat and the water we drink.
