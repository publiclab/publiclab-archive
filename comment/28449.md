Thanks a lot [@ruthnwaiganjo](/profile/ruthnwaiganjo) sir for the feedback. I know the current priority of Public lab is Plots2 and spectral-benchmark and thats completely fine. I proposed this proposal Because, there is no project got mentioned which is based on JS  (or other tech apart from ruby) and ImageSequencer being so Powerful i wanted to enhance it more.All listed ideas are based on ruby and honestly speaking , i don't know much about ruby ðŸ˜… . I thought i could help somehow.But No Problem. Lastly thank you sir for your precious time.
