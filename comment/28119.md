Hi Ruth! Much appreciation for this post -- and I know you'll do well finding a new job after the fellowship! 🎉 

> a discussion to add some imagery on the dashboard

regarding this, i'm wondering if a look at our Style Guide could have some good ideas for design...

https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/05-07-2019/introducing-a-draft-style-guide-for-public-lab (and https://publiclab.org/wiki/ui)

What about something like this (the bottom idea)? That said, i think it's a delicate design project because this is already becoming quite crowded. So, i think this is one of those projects which we might want to think on gradually and weigh options, but to push implementation to the end of the timeline. Maybe it's a good one to open up an issue and discuss in depth there.
