Thanks for your kind answer Ned:

I will try to start the experiment of the spectroradiometer on the calibration targets during different times of the day during this month. Also, I was thinking about to repeat the experiment of June, September and December, to evaluate the effect of the seasons (basically the astronomic position of the Earth relative to the sun). I forgot to tell you that I'm carry on this experiment to have regression(s) equation(s) that could be used in any time of the year for any photography and calculate vegetation indices.

By the other hand, sometimes UAV companies argue about the real use of the radiometric calibration if UAV's photographs are going to be always affected by many variables like shadows of the clouds, morning dew or low altitude gases in the air. What do you think about that?
