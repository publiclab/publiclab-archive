I'm still assembling the components inside the box and using a RPI2b (the ones I got home ;). For the power I'm using a lipo batery together with the Adafruit Powerboost 500. This way the pi gets the power via GPIO and a switch is used to turn on and off the camera. On friday I'll post the details ;D
