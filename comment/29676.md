Microplastics Are Invaders To Our Environment
    There is a new war on Terrorism that needs to be waged. However, this battle is not against human combatants that are foreign and abroad, but world wide! This dangerous enemy is both domestic and foreign. The mission of these marauders is to invade and affect every fiber of our biosphere. I am referring to the indigenous pollutants known as "microplastics". Microplastics are man-made and despite serving a multiple of useful purposes, have radically and aggressively damaged the environment. Microplastics  have invaded all of the spheres both abiotic and biotic ranging from the deepest depths of the oceans to the highest mountain peaks. These pollutants are invasive and having catastrophic impacts on every phase of life. In December of 2020, medical science reported the first discovery  of microplastics in human placenta of an unborn fetus! The Peace talks are over! The entire human race needs to declare war on these man-made assailants that seek to change life as we know it.
