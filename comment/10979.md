The one from Society of Robots right [here from 2006](http://www.societyofrobots.com/robotforum/index.php?topic=158.msg1695#msg1695). Better than the retail & academic search I started with, I'm impressed you found a forum from 2006.  I'm going to cross post this on EnviroDIY.org, maybe in the [Commercial Sensors](http://envirodiy.org/forum/interest/commercial-sensors/) forum, along with some of the AUV crowd's thoughts.  

I'll start a note on more use cases, like [Side scan sonar in oyster management](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4010573_Side_scan_sonar_in_oyster_management) by Diaz, Cuevas, Buchanan, Gordon, and Perret:<br> "Information acquired from side scan sonar provides a long-term record, which can be used to detect changes due to environmental catastrophes, vessel groundings and/or harvest pressure."
