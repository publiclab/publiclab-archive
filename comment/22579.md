Hi Mary! Good questions and you mentioned a number of resources I would have suggested as starting places well. Maybe a few more for your list could be EJScreen (https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen) and SkyTruth Alerts (http://alerts.skytruth.org/)  "SkyTruth Alerts delivers real-time updates about environmental incidents in your backyard"
