Hi,
I tried to re-create the lycopene extraction with methanol and ethanol (lab grade) but didn't get anywhere. It's my understanding that they are too polar, so I've switched to diethyl ether, which worked. It's hard to find pure outside of a lab, but you can use engine starter fluid (which can be found in petrol stations), which is typically a mix of heptane and ether, and so works without any problem. The UV spec in my lab gives good results for this, so I'm about to try with the Desktop Spec v3 to see if it can also detect the lycopene. Is there anything particular in grain alcohol that would have facilitated the extraction? I'd love to know how you did it as Lycopene isn't meant to be soluble in alcohols, but they're much easier to get hold of and to use than the engine starter fluid so I'd rather use an alcohol instead if possible.
