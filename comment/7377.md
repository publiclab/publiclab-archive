If you take pictures at higher angles (more perpendicular and less oblique) you may achieve a more Lambertian response. Dealing more directly with BRDF using balloon platforms may not be practical though. If you want to perform automated classification then you will need at least 3 bands, unless you are just trying to segment an image into veg and non-veg. What is your classification task?
