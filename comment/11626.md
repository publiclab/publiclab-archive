Hi 
I have tried several white balance options before, base on what I've read.
On this pics the settings were exactly the same as the maxmax camera.
As you mentioned I had determined I had a problem with my NIR band, the values are too low, I need to add some "gain".
I was interested in knowing if anyone had any suggestions, if there was a way to measure the "gain" I need to add to my NIR band, maybe regression analysis, or a way to determine a function (to add or multiply with the band) anything to correct photos already taken.
But I will definitely try your suggestions this weekend.
Will let you know later how it worked out.
Thank you so much.
Best regards,
Rita
