There are Lego bricks for just about anything :)

I was thinking that, since there are screw holes in the corners of the board already, flat topped screws or bolts could be used to create 'legs' that keep the thermal flashlight a constant distance from the wall.  One could even add a little felt or other softening surface to reduce friction and the chance of gouging the wall.  Similarly, a small plastic frame could probably be 3D printed without too much effort
