Re: water level, The commercial version has a low water sensor that shuts the fan off to let it try to survive. It won't resume air circulation until the water level comes back up.

I too wonder about carbon containment (at the bottom of my post I have a couple questions about that), mostly for efficacy. Maybe I'll try a food based glue on the growth medium to stick the carbon in the layer I want (but still give roots access).
