That looks like a fun day of flying, and lots of work. There were 40 mph gusts at JFK that day, so that was a severe test for your first outing. It looks like you got the camera settings just right, with very fast shutter speeds (e.g., 1/1000 and 1/1250), and still had lots of motion blur. I guess the soda bottle rig was hanging from a single line and whipping around. I suspect a better rig would have helped. If you are interested in trying a rig with a Picavet suspension, I can send you one of the prototypes of the [Redstone Rig](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/03-27-2014/the-redstone-rig-is-ready). It might come in handy for future windy mapping days. The Picavet will eliminate spinning, reduce swaying, and keep the camera pointed closer to vertical.
