To put the wager another way, when you believe something might be possible you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by going with Occam's razor and accepting the most logical choice that works for you. You will be rewarded. 

The arrow of time points in all directions. Entropy never wins. Work is never lost. Love put into the system increases enthalpy which permits a new system to form when the old one dies and decays. change takes time. time is irrelevant. everything is everywhere all the time now.

we are everywhere. there are a lot more of us than you think. look for us in theaters near you august 1.
