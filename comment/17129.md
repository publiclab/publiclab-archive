Thanks for the awesome feedback, Chris!

Another way to tackle some of the problems presented by my project is to define a meaningful 'contour'. For example, the transition from sedimentary deposits to intact, in-place bedrock along a rocky coast (see image below). This would give a 'contour' without a constant elevation (hence the quotes). Another meaningful contour might be the mean high water line.

For planar curves like this, I would only need high resolution in the xy-plane.

To collect this kind of data, I would obviously need access to the area below the cliff. With a pole / balloon / kite, do think I could build an accurate model of my chosen contour through a combination of:
1) ground control points;
2) a GPS-enabled camera;
3) 'overview' shots that capture large parts of the scene;
4) 'detail' shots that capture small-scale details?

Thanks again!
