This is a great illustration that all of the standard white balance settings are very similar. The custom white balance setting used to produce photos that can be converted directly to a facsimile of NDVI is very extreme. For a Wratten 25 red filter good photos have a turquoise hue:

[![PetrW25hist.JPG](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/256/large/PetrW25hist.JPG)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/256/original/PetrW25hist.JPG)

The histogram is for a small area of tree foliage (lower right). All of the pixels in that area have: 

1. a blue channel value higher than the red channel value
2. no values near 0 (far left) or 255 (far right)

Below is an NDVI image for that stitched mosaic:

[![PetrW25NDVI.JPG](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/257/large/PetrW25NDVI.JPG)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/017/257/original/PetrW25NDVI.JPG)

The NDVI values for foliage are mostly around 0.2 to 0.3. Those values are probably well below the appropriate values for NDVI because the original photos did not have a big enough difference between the blue and red channels, or because both channels were too bright. It's a bit of an art to take photos that can be converted directly to NDVI images with meaningful values. A camera which allows custom white balance settings is probably a requirement.
