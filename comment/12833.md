Yes -- at this point it might very well be possible to do temp, conductivity, and turbidity while only needing to put screws through the cap, and this approach does seem very elegant to me!

It's good to know that we can put wires through the sealant and still remain waterproof for long periods of time -- this enables a simple design for a depth sensor that would involve a long wire sticking out of the cap ... which is probably not for v. 1.0 of the riffle, but could be very useful down the line ... 

[@mathew](/profile/mathew) -- we used the 0-80 machine screws on ~ 20 sensors in Bogota, and had two issues: they were on the tiny side re: manipulating them, and the o-rings seemed to pop out from under the screw head when we applied significant pressure in screwing them in.  So we might want to play with a few options ... but still serviceable!
