I am going to try the experiment with an extraction of grass pigments by ethanol even if I don't think there is a big difference. That will allow to have a comparison of two different extraction methods :)

In plant cells, there is also an other pigment that chlorophyll, the carotenoids. And this pigment absorb in the range of 400-500 nm, so we must to consider that in this spectrum.

I think that try on only chlorophyll is a good comparison to make, but the problem is to have only chlorophyll ... So, create an "amateur" chromatography to separate the different pigments is an ambitious idea whose I am going to cogitate :)
