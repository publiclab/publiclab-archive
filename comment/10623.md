Sorry for taking so long to write a reply.

I realized that what I replied with initially wasn't what you were asking.

Lactic Acid is what they now replace Formaldehyde with in eco-friendly detergents. I somehow read you were wanting something better than Formaldehyde in that chunk of text, when really all you were asking was for the bacteria that produce such things.

Lactic acid is produced by Lactobacillus.

You should look for a homebrew group in your area on Facebook or something, and ask if anyone has some SCOBY.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCOBY

It stands for Symbiotic Colony of Bacteria and Yeast. There are a.number of varieties, each with a different outcome in food production, but could be relevant to this. In particular, I noticed that ginger beer is brewed from a SCOBY, aptly called a Ginger Beer Plant (made from a sub type of Lactobacillus - the hilgardii variety & Saccharomyces florentinus - as yeast causes your strawberries to go bad.).

I am now imagining ginger roots & ginger beer as a write this. Mmm...ginger beer...
