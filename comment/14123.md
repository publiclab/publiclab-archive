I'm getting crazy, there is massive amount of talk about mobius conversions but there is no single guidance for converting the mobius for ndvi. I've purchased DIY Filter Kit but now I have no idea about what to do. When we remove the IR-block filter, where do we place the new filter? Whether will it be glued or what? which glue? I need help from you guys, thanks in advance.
