One avenue is government grants ~ As part of the American Rescue Plan, the EPA will be awarding $20 million to air quality monitoring projects next year, with a $2M carve-out for community projects! The funding opportunity is open for applications from now until February 25, 2022: http://carbej.blogspot.com/2021/12/funding-opportunity-enhanced-air.html

In California, the CA Air Resources Board has a [Community Air Protection Program](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/capp/about) that includes funding for community air monitoring projects and community emissions reduction programs. Additional communities will be considered each year.
