Here's one of the EPA source sampling methods: select method 316 in the pick list here for the purified DI water capture method: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc/

Then also, I found this reference to "bubbler techniques" which a lot of modern sampling techniques stopped using bubblers (impingers) because they were just to messy and prone to spilling.  Now people prefer to use coated media contained in a tube.
