Hi @ mridulnagpal , the documentation looks good. But can you work on the formatting a bit since the markdown is broken at places ? Also include the links to any FTO issues you made. Also you can link your commits like https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-blurred-location/commits?author=mridulnagpal . That will show all the contributions you made
