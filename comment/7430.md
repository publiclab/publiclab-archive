This is really good information. Another thing that might make red filters a good choice is that it is easier to make a red filter than an infrablue one. A red filter just has to pass all wavelengths longer than 600 nm and block shorter ones. An infrablue filter has to be a gap filter, blocking red light (600 to 700 nm) but passing both longer (NIR) and shorter (blue) wavelengths. Red filters with steep cutoff curves at 600 nm have been used for photography for decades and are available in inexpensive polyester versions. Gap filters which block only between 600 and 700 nm have no common use in photography and are available only in expensive glass versions. Both types of filters are approximated by inexpensive theatrical lighting filters, but the spectral properties of the red ones seem to be closer to what we need than the blue ones.
