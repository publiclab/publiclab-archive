Actually i think we've pretty much hit our target for spectral resolution. I'd like a better way to measure it (dave haffner's been chipping away at a method using solar spectra) but it's probably in the 5 nm range, maybe better. 

At this point we need to improve our signal to noise ratio, esp. for liquid samples. We can take a baseline and a sample but there's not a lot of dynamic range to tell the difference. This may just be a sample preparation issue -- for example, increasing the amount of sample and using a strong enough light source to shine through it... Check out some of JoshMC's work:

And this one showing a baseline compared to UV reflected/fluoresced off of some makeup:
