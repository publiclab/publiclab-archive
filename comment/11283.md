For anyone who wants to try out the excel tool, here is the video’s for the recordings I made for the colorimetric nitrite analysis, the EC and flame emission experiments. The Video name’s indicate the sequence in which I recorded the standards and samples. The flame emission and colorimetric analysis works best with the recording playing when it is being analysed, but you will have to have, careful timing to start the measurement only when the spectra for a given sample appears. If you select too many replicates and a too large measurement area the analysis might be slow and therefor the video will play into the next sample before the given sample is completely analysed.
