I'm not positive, but since the Coqui is measuring resistance (which reveals conductivity) as in this diagram: https://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/09-30-2014/coqui-bbv1-0#Schematic

...i would guess that you could add a resistor to one of the probes, so basically you'd be measuring the resistance of the water PLUS the resistor, and that this would make the frequency lower, and so the pitch lower. But you'd have to try it out, my Coqui is not working right now!
