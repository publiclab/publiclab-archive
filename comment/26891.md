Hey all, Just wanted to say a big thanks for making [@sashae](/profile/sashae) and me feel so welcome on the Open Call yesterday. We are such huge fans of Public Lab, so it was just brilliant to be able to share our work with you and to receive in return such generous advice. We are excited to finally connect and for what will come!
