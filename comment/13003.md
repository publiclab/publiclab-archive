well, it's all tradeoffs...I'd prefer to have an option to use AAs without a soldering iron, since it's the simplest way to get the thing working out of the box. 

Is it an option to have a 2-pin JST somewhere for power? seems smallest/cheapest, but you know the layout of this thing.

I'd love to avoid saying, "required skills and tools: Soldering" if we can, even if it added 0.1 to each kit.
