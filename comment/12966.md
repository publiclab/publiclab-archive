[@warren](/profile/warren), Thanks for the response, that's interesting, but not exactly what I am looking for. I am actually interested in trying to identify subsurface archaeological features that become visible in crop growth (particularly during droughts) due to the effects of past human activity that is no longer visible on the surface (such as the construction of trenches or mounds that have since been leveled out). My thought is that if these features are visible when the crops are stressed (during drought), it might also be possible to detect them during non-drought seasons by highlighting differences in the rate of photosynthesis (or vigorousness of plant growth) over the course of a season. So, I think it would be a matter of taking a series of  identical images (weekly perhaps) and then overlaying/processing them in some way that would highlight the differences in rate of photosynthesis. For example, crops might grow more vigorously in one area because it contains a decayed post hole with organic matter that retains water, while another area might grow less vigorously because the soil was compressed by the construction of a mound ... even if, perhaps, all the growth evens out by the end of the season. Do you think this type of analysis seem possible or not really viable?
