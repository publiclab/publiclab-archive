Is there any sample input/output sets from going through this process, manually or automatically? 

I was thinking that a good test/spec might include at least one sample set with:

**Input:** an image set that's been manually processed

**Output:** a `results.csv` and `area.csv` based on a manual processing of the input image

One of the sample sets could be from the original cited research, ideally -- but we could also include "difficult" image sets to ensure the method developed robustly replicates the manual method. 

It'd also helpful to run a new set through as well, where the outputs are not known by the developer of the automated process, to see if it can generate close enough outputs without knowing them in advance. 

Then, a good test of the success of an automated system would be based on how close the output "results.csv" and "area.csv" are, in comparison to the supplied ones. 

Great detail on the stepwise work here, thanks!
