The Plantower sensors require 4.5 to 5.5 volts. They work well with 5 volt Arduinos. They might not work properly with ESP8266 or ESP32 boards because they are 3.3 volt boards. The Plantower sensors might limp along with 3.3 volts. It's always possible to use separate power supplies for the board and the sensor. But then the sensor might send a 5 volt data signal back to a 3.3 volt board. There is no harm in trying (unless toasting a $5 board is considered harm).

PurpleAir sensors use a Plantower sensor and an ESP 8266. So it can be done if you know how.
