It's true that in ideal conditions a single line of pixels should be enough but if you want a high quality spectrum you certainly need more. To get a good resolution you need a very thin slit and that means that not much light gets through. Noise is then a huge problem, when dealing with a faint signals or a very large dynamic range. That problem can be solved either by longer exposure (I am currently forced to average multiple 30s exposures with a high ISO for faint sources) or by averaging pixels vertically (I can currently average about 20 pixels without apparent loss in the resolution, but 200 would be much better). 

And yes, using these kinds of 'signal amplifications' I can certainly clearly detect the Hg 405nm line, even though it's really on the edge of what the bayer filter lets through. If you want to see it on a spectrum plot, you really have to callibrate it properly. You have to divide you spectrum with a recorded spectrum of a tungsten lamp and multiply it by a calculated blackbody spectrum. My callibration is not perfect (specially at the edges) but it's still better than no callibration at all.

Does anyone know what could be the source of the 445.1/445.8 lines? I can't identify it. 

This kind of intensity callibration certainly makes the solar spectrum much nicer. Here you can see a comparison between a noon solar spectrum and a sunrise solar spectrum, together with the sodium D lines from the table salt. By comparing the two, you can clearly see which parts of the spectrum get absorbed by the atmosphere.

The problem with the grating film was that I was getting a terrible spectral resolution, with all kinds of artifacts, because of the slight curvature of the sheet. I am currently trying to epoxy the sheet to a flat piece of glass. The problem is that if the epoxy is not of a perfectly even thickness it acts as a lens, randomly bending the light. If I don't use the epoxy but sandwich the grating between a two pieces of glass, then I avoid this lens effect but potentially get multiples of each spectral line caused by the internal reflections from the glass surfaces - a huge problem I was having when I was using a CD as a reflective diffraction grating.
