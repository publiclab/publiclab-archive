Hi MadTinker, SO sorry to hear about your work lost. Really feel terrible and want to help. I'm not sure why the publish button was not active...if you have the heart to, could you give more of a detailed play-by-play and WebWG will attempt to debug? I'm personally very excited to read about your replication results, and frustrated that the website didn't help you share your work.
