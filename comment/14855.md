Yeah, the screen could have GPS coords and the start time. the photos are taken at increments, so you can determine time from which image in the series, if they are being taken regularly. Start time + (image number * interval) will give you accurate time of the image. I would recommend having that data on head and tail of the series. 

I think those are all the tools needed, and just bouncing proposed methods off a wily attorney would give you a solid MO.
