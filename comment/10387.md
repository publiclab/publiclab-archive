[@stevie](/profile/stevie) running three samples and averaging them is a great idea.  You can see in the labels that I started running 3-5 tests per sample to go for bright, medium, and dim readings.  When those curves were normalized they matched eachother in shape pretty well (as long as there were no blowouts).  I think we could include that in the method-- I don't think much would have to be added to spectral workbench-- just looking to see if the dividing lines were close would work.

As for the vertical lines--I'm not sure what it is supposed to be called, but essentially we're integrating the area underneath the graph and then dividing it so exactly 50% on one side and 50% on the other side of the line.
