That's a really good spectrum, even though it looks a little dim. There are no overexposed peaks in any channel, but if the image had been brighter, some peaks would have been lost in the brightest channels. So the exposure is really as good as you can get.

A greater limitation of the hardware may be the resolution.  There is not even one pixel per nm, so there is not much resolution to spare to define where the peaks are. 

It's cool to see such good results from bare ingredients.
