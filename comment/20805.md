That's a good point, Chris. People ask us what the magnification of our microscope is, and what we're able to tell them are the dimensions of the field of view, but I realize that answer isn't quite what people are looking for. 

I can compare our images to images of similar things captured with microscopes that are set to 100x, 200x, etc magnification, so I have a ballpark sense of where they probably fit.

There are a few unknowns about the webcams (they don't come with super detailed specs, and when they're inverted they end up further from the sensor than when they started-- they're not flipped PRECISELY in place).  I know one option might be to do a very thorough teardown with a micrometer and work through the formulas first for figuring out the focal length of the lenses themselves and then the distances between them, the camera sensor, and the slide (maybe?) but was also curious if there was a way to work backwards from an existing image, or if there are things to know about calculating this for a digital image vs something you'd look at through an eyepiece. 

My experience with microscopes prior to this project was pretty limited, so it's all new to me!
