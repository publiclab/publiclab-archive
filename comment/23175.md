Yes. Kodi is a multimedia player Operating System used to have plugged to the TV and playing films and so on. Raspbian is a full GNU/linux operating system you'll be able to use as camera and many more: server, multimedia player, trail cam... Use the Desktop Raspbian and not the Lite version.

Then you need to go to Menu >> System tools >> Raspi config and activate the camera in the second tab "Interfaces"
