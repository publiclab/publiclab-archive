Hi! This is awesome. You can find some more on related projects at [#pi-camera](/tag/pi-camera) and [#raspberry-pi-infragram](/tag/raspberry-pi-infragram)
  

We're also working on a cool project to make RPi images easier to pregenerate for download - you should check it out!&nbsp;[https://publiclab.org/n/17262](https://publiclab.org/n/17262)

  

Would your workflow be possible using Image Sequencer? [#image-sequencer](/tag/image-sequencer)

  

Thanks for sharing!!!
