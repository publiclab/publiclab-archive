Thank you for the papers.  Still working my way through them.  Wanted to comment on the difference between chemi-,bio-,and straight luminescence.  Luminescence takes an activating light source, while the other two dont.  This makes a big difference in the optics.  Where normally ( with regular spectroscopy and luminescence) the cuvettes have to be carefully engineered (for example,so the sides are as close to parallel as possible) this isn't the case bioluminescence and chemiluminescence.  Often, the sides used with chemi- and bio- are not parallel ( usually a no-no) and a convex lens may be built into the side closest to the detector.  It increases sensitivity and since there are very few reflections, made cost cheaper.
