Great, thanks for the wiki page! I will start gathering and publishing info there soon.

I was thinking about the reflective gratings as well, but didn't know they were called holographic. I have found a couple of websites selling them. As they are bit more expensive (85-105$) and also delicate, this would be an application for more complex spectrometers. Maybe there are some cheaper sources.

What about the grating density, do you think 1000/mm is still good? As I understand it, to keep the angle of first order spectra well separated from higher order ones, it would be nice to keep close to that figure, but seing that the geometry of the device will have to change anyway, this being a reflective grating, maybe going for a 1200/mm would be better? I ask because as we get into lower wavelengths, we may need higher grating densities?

Looked up some HD pinhole cameras, some do 1280x960 resolution video and 3264x2448 stills, that's pretty good right? Does the SpectralWorkbench software need stills input or video?
Also, I wonder if the pinhole cameras that are being sold are really pinhole cameras or if they are just tiny, fixed lens cameras, which would kind of defeat the purpose....
