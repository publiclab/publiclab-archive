That's a very important observation. Had I originally calibrated this spectrum on the 436 line and the 611 line (instead of 405 and 650), all the other lines would have matched much better. I think it might be a mistake to use the outer lines for calibration because they might have more distortion for some reason ([maybe the effect stoft was describing](http://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/03-02-2015/cfl-cal-error-explained)).  Nevertheless, the polynomial was able to correct the lines well, so the final spectrum is probably better than any uncorrected one.
