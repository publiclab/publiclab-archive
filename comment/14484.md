That might be normal behavior for the spectrometer. The slit allows only a narrow beam of light to hit the diffraction grating. If the beam does not hit the grating at the correct place, the diffraction pattern will not be projected toward the camera. Smaller targets must be aligned just right so the light reaches the camera. I haven't used that version of the spectrometer. Adjusting all the angles could produce better results, and it might take some trial and error.
