Hi there. Love the mockup. I had a few thoughts:

- Can there be a general way in which people "follow" questions. Some people really like answering them, or answering them on a certain topic. I see this is being different from following a tag, because that would include research notes and other material. Maybe we could include a place on the landing page for people to get alerts when someone asks a question, or a question on a certain topic.  
- Similarly, can you sort questions by tags? Again, I see this as different from sorting everything by a tag, (you'd end up with notes and research notes as well) I guess this is as a separate search like we sort out questions first then tags that follow. 
- I'm wondering why the person who answers the question gets to "approve" the answer? I'm concerned that it makes them the gatekeeper in a sense. Perhaps they got one they didn't think was particularly helpful, it still could be helpful to someone else. Also, they could end up moving on and not approving answers. The question could be left hanging looking unanswered with people contributing time and energy to respond without seeing their work show up.  I think I'm more in favor of all answers showing up, and we could moderate first time posters like we do on research notes through the moderation group. 
- Can you clarify the comment section? Is this for people to ask clarifying questions? I could see people accidentally answering the question there. 
- I'm not sure I like the idea of having a dislike option. Just culturally for Public Lab, I'd rather be supportive of someone trying to respond than dislike an answer. I could see a function like this being used in moderation (as in making sure tone is ok) but I feel this should be dealt with in a different way.  Is there a way for people to thread off of answers? As in, potentially ask for clarification or comment on why they disagree? 
- for the reputation/ activity thing you mentioned, I think I'd rather just see a link to someone's profile than tag them with anything else, such as "expert" 

This looks great! I'm really excited for it. Thanks for sharing out :)
