I guess I'm thinking of how we might use different correction files for different lamps, and how people might upload and share new correction files for new lamps. Using the Spectrum database storage and infrastructure for that seems reasonable, and it lets us use the new Operations system to apply the correction. Does that make sense? Maybe we can flag them as corrections data in metadata so they aren't confused with a real spectrum.
