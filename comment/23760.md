[@warren](/profile/warren),  Also, I will really love to work on more ideas that can be implemented.

For autocalibration of the peak, I think we might have to either search for any function in the library which we are using to plot the graph. For manual implementation in `graph.js`, we might have to do some math to find the first order derivative or the second order derivative of the function of the wave (which will be very complicated. Though, one way we can do this is by keeping a track of the records of the values being received of the y-axis and their corresponding x-axis in a 2-D matrix. For finding the max, we can either use an efficient algorithm. 

Secondly, for increasing resolution, using this in our capture code, we can have the resolution available upto 4k - 

     var constraints = { 
     video: {
        width: { ideal: 4096 },
        height: { ideal: 2160 } 
     } 
    };

I think it will work as the browser extracts the max from the given options. Or we can give more options like - 

    video: {
      optional: [
       {minWidth: 320},
       {minWidth: 640},
       {minWidth: 1024},
       {minWidth: 1280},
       {minWidth: 1920},
      {minWidth: 2560}
     ]
    };

I have not yet read much about the tools being used in Spectral Workbench, thus am not able to comment on how can we add new tools, but will surely understand how are the tools being implemented and made and will brainstorm on finding a standardized and easier way of adding tools to the library in order to facilitate its expansion.
