This guy seems to have worked out a process for cutting filters:

"Cutting your own custom glass can be done either with a standard glass cutter, by scribing and breaking, or using a diamond cutting disk on a light power tool (dremel). I found that using a glasscutter was very effective and also quite precise on 3mm thick glass, but when trying 1mm thick clear filter it resulted in splinters onlyâ€¦"  more at:

I'm not sure how 3mm thick glass would fit in a small camera like that.  I would love to know how much it would improve the resolution of the photos compared to a film filter. It might be possible to make several little rectangles from one standard filter. Any body have an old Wratten 87 filter you're not using?
