Hey Keshav, 
I have read your proposal in great detail and it looks awesome. 
Couple of pointers i have:

1. I would like to see some more mocks and wireframes, gifs maybe if possible.
2. We are really pushing having great tests in all our projects, hence do you think you would need more time for testing than 1 week because we have no tests, right? 
3. I need you to think on how we can make use of maps using inline syntax more intuitive to the users, should we do autocomplete? Or a link  somewhere to see usage? 
4. We can make the map module also generic, make functionalities to change map layer, map marker, etc. This is optional and you may include if you have time.

Overall i like the proposal very much ðŸ˜ƒ !

Thanks :)
