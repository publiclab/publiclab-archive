This was a good project.  Take a look at this figure of a spectrum of a fluorescent lamp: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fluorescent_lighting_spectrum_peaks_labelled.gif

You are right that mercury emissions produce some of the sharp blue and green peaks in the fluorescent spectrum. The phosphors, which contain elements such as terbium and europium, also produce sharp peaks.  There really isn't a source of much light with a continuous spectrum in a fluorescent lamp.
