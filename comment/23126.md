Darn - just went to edit a long answer and the PL web site deleted my save. Check the camera in the spectrometer works just as a web cam. If you have two cameras plugged in - spectrometer camera and a web camera - unplug the web cam, SW doesn't seem to cope well with two cameras. Try using a camera app such as GUCView to adjust camera gain, WB, etc. Setting will persist if you close GUCView and immediately click Capture on SW.
