I don't know how much LEDs vary in their NIR emission. But it's easy to add some NIR LEDs to the mix. There is an advantage to using only artificial lighting (doing the whole thing at night) because then the spectral quality of the illumination is constant. That can make computing indices (e.g., NDVI) more reliable.

One problem with lamps is that they could cast shadows which will add distinct patterns to the photos and also might compute to erroneous NDVI values (a common issue). Ideally, the lamps should be in a wide array behind a diffuser to reduce shadowing.

If you use lamps at night, the proportion of red to NIR might not be similar to daylight so standard indices will not give typical results. That is, legacy NDVI is based on the assumption that the foliage is being illuminated by sunlight which has a particular proportion of red and NIR. If you change this proportion, NDVI values could change and be out of the expected range for NDVI of healthy foliage. That won't be a problem, but you will have to redefine the range of NDVI values which signify healthy foliage.
