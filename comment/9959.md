This letter contains a good overview of what has happened so far with EPA (see the background section). http://www.capecodbaywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/NPDESLetter_Final_2014Jan28.pdf We have specifically been trying to get the NPDES permit updated (which would bring about an updated env'tal assessment of the cooling system, including the thermal pollution among other issues). As of last month, we are now asking for the facility to be shut down considering all the missed deadlines by EPA to renew the permit. We just posted this recently: http://www.capecodbaywatch.org/2014/07/close-pilgrim-its-the-only-way-to-stop-entergy-from-using-the-bay-as-a-dump/ and are asking people to take action and contact EPA and their legislators. In addition to this, there has also been advocacy targeting NMFS based on impacts of plume on endangered species - I'll send you a chronology document of that work by email...too much to type out. Hope that helps!
