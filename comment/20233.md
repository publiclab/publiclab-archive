ok. Busy few weeks.

I got my spectrometer working. Credit to my son who shined his iphone light directly into the spectrometer. Thanks for the tip TROYB.

Somehow I must have missed that you have to really shine a light directly into the slit. I thought any amount of light, like my living room background light would work. I guess not.

Had to wait two weeks, but got it outside today, more or less pointing directly at the sun.
