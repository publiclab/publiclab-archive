Ugh, once again I need help.  I was going to do some readings outside today and for some reason when I hooked up the spectrometer it was using my macbook's webcam.  I selected "deny" on the capture prompt.  I made sure that in google settings that the default camera was the spectrometer and went back into spectral workbench but now it's not even prompting me to allow or deny now.  I can't figure out how to get the prompt so that I can take readings again.
