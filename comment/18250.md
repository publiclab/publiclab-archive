Do you mean which magnification?   Either 40x or 100x are good.  I think the 40x is slightly easier to start with, since it's easier to find your material in the field of view.  At 100x, any slight vibration changes the view dramatically, and it requires a significantly lighter touch to get the hang of being able to focus on anything specific
