Hi Ned,
I have a son who is a pretty good programmer and knows Java.  I talked to him and he is seeing if he can use your plugin and add a piece to create just a red layer out of the R+NIR layer so that we can then feed it into your system so that we can create whatever relationships we want.

I'll keep you appraised.
