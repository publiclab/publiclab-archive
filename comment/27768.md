I have not used a CCS-811 VOC sensor outdoors. That's mostly because I live in the woods in Vermont and the data would be boring. However the sensor would probably document emissions from my wood stove and when trucks drive past my house.  

If you live in a city or next to industry that sensor would certainly document variations in atmospheric concentrations of certain types of compounds. When deployed indoors the sensor is sensitive enough to respond to concentrations that were not possible to smell, so it would probably do the same outside.

It would be very easy for someone to test this. The components are inexpensive ($20) and the assembly has been documented and the code made available. 

>A couple of air quality researchers I've talked to say that currently available low-cost metal oxide (MOX) and photoionization detector (PID) sensors don't produce accurate data.

This is important information but limited accuracy does not necessarily rule out a role for these sensors. Also, it's great to see that Public Lab now seems to be open to the advice of researchers.
