Thanks [@Cindy_Excites](/profile/Cindy_Excites) - these are super resources and I have not seen them previously. I wonder how the emerging field of data literacy could borrow from this work around maker communities and digital fabrication education. We have definitely been using some of the same folks - Dewey, Freire, bell hooks, Papert - for inspiration.
