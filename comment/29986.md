Look up conductivity cell and wheatstone bridge Instead of feeding DC into the weatstone bridge, the audio signal is fed in.  One leg of the wheatsone bridge is a liquid conductivity cell.  The other side is a variable resistor that you adjust until the meter or sound "nulls"(reaches aminimum). One of the EPA methods (EPA method 120.1:Conductance(specific conductance, umhos at 25C) by Conductivity Meter, gives details on using a Wheatstone bridge type device.  I looked them up on the internet an they are still listed by a number of suppliers.  Basically, its an audio generator feeding a wheatsone bridge.  The old instrument we had required platinum electrodes for use with high purity DI water.  We would test how contaminated washed devices would change water conductivity.  But there is no reason platinum electrodes should be needed for this work.  Therre has to be a cheap way to do this.  I jsut dont know what it is.
