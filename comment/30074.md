Hi [@sara_rx](/profile/sara_rx), thank you for your proposal! I really like the dark background choice -- it makes sense since we're working with light, right? :-)

The full-width fixed navbar and sidebar work really well, very minimal footprint and efficient use of space. Would the logo and all disappear once you drop an image in? Maybe it'll be helpful to make a mockup which includes the uploaded image, so we can see how it'd look. I wonder if the first step should be open already. Many of the tools could create a pop-up modal window too which could include more explanation and such, so I like how compact they are to start, but how flexible they could be once activated. 

Have you looked through the Bootstrap library a bit? Do you think it'll take a lot of customization or that it could be themed to achieve the dark look you're going for? 

Overall I appreciate the proposal, thank you very much!
