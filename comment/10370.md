It sounds like the cuvettes absorb some oils (not quite the same as melting, but bad none the less).  Plastic cuvettes are made for use with aqueous solutions.  My guess is that the gel caps did this as well, and probably to a greater extent.  
The cure for that is to go with glass.  Here is a glass cuvette for $16 with shipping.  http://www.amazon.com/10mm-Standard-Glass-Cuvette-3-5ml/dp/B005CI71MA
  You could try working with a more polar solvent.  Perhaps isopropanol (rubbing alcohol). I dont know if the plastic would stand up to that solvent but it might be worth a shot.  If you do try it, you should know that fluorescence can be sensitive to changes in solvent polarity.
Good luck.
