Ok, another memory that brings a smile to my face is the following: the staff were all in unseasonably-cold New Orleans.  I scored a bed in the VRBO we had but Matt Lippincott did not, so I told him if he got cold he could jump into bed with me.  He took me up on my offer at 3 AM so I moved over to the cold side of the bed.  Brrrrr.  Then, in the delirium of sleep, Matt calmly gloated, "Mmmmmm, pre-warmed."
