Thanks for sharing these notes Pat. That is odd that you were hassled about a permit. I have flown at other East Bay Regional Parks and have never heard anything about a permit. There are very bold warning signs at my local park about "no RC airplanes" but I have never heard about no kites or no balloons. The regulated height for model airplanes is 400', so I am wondering if this particular ranger was confusing the two separate activities.
Regardless, the donation model is really interesting and seems like a great way to engage new groups and places.
