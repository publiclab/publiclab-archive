When the kmz file (attached in the previous comment) is loaded in Google Earth you must click "Exit Photo" to regain control of Google Earth. Then you can right click on the "MiddFalls" place in the places panel and click Properties and adjust the alignment of the photo. If you make it better, you can right click it again and "Save place as" a new name and share the new kmz around.
