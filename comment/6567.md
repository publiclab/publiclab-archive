I think if we do something with a few more lines, as you say, we can try it out. Say, 75-50-25-0-25-50-75, each band being about a 1/4" wide. If you could just print a very long set of bands, I can just chop it up into slices for distribution. Let's try it out and we can iterate if it's not quite right. Cool.
