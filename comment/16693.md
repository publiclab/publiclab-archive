Hi, folks!

I'm not going to post the list just yet, as announcements may still be getting discovered :-)

But: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/05-04-2017/google-summer-of-code-2017-and-a-call-for-community-mentors

I want to especially thank students who submitted proposals and contributed to our software already, but who we were not able to accept this year. Public Lab's Web Working Group is pretty small and we have only so much capacity to support students, but we hope you'll consider working with us again!

Finally, thanks and congratulations to the students who've been accepted this year.
