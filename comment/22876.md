You could buy a webcam from Amazon, use a spare DVD some razor blades, black paper, double-stick tape and build one for about $50 (most of the expense is the webcam).

Here are a few notes on devices I've built.

Note: While the above projects were designed to be mechanically compatible with the PLab approach to product, many details can be simplified in a purely experimental setup.

1) The webcam-DVD needs to be stable and the DVD to webcam distance generally as short as possible.
2) The slit should be mechanically 'tied' to the webcam-DVD assembly so the optical path remains stable
3) use good double-stick and glue, not velcro and wood (for the rigid parts) rather than paper
4) Otherwise, housing cover parts can be replaced with a black cloth just to keep the light out

The basics are really quite simple and generally the two biggest factors are 1) keeping the 3 parts (webcam, DVD and slit) as rigid as possible and 2) keeping out any stray light. Next is just the alignment of the slit to the DVD/webcam -- but that's a simple 45-deg angle.
