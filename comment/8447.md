>>my approach would be to upload multiple images and list them off-map. The user can then select photos to display them on map.

I agree, this is a good way to do it. If the user wanted to upload a few more photos, could it happen in the background?

Does anyone have a small set of photos with GPS data that have been made into a map by hand?  It would be really interesting to see the relationship between the photos' final lat long centroid on the map and the GPS coordinates in the jpg files. How strong does this relationship have to be to make this project useful?
