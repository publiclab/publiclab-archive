Alex,
The two filters are probably the same. The [#19](/n/19) filter will work best if the you do a custom white balance on the camera before you take photos. Flood the sensor with red light while doing the custom white balance (FuncSet/WhiteBalance/Custom) e.g., by pointing at red paper in direct sunlight. Photos of healthy foliage will then be turquoise, and the NDVI values will be closer to where they should be and have more range.

To make the NDVI image above, both histograms were stretched and 20 was added to the NDVI values (digital number) to put them closer to the right range.
