Hi [@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2), [@warren](/profile/warren) and [@liz](/profile/liz)!
So, people can report anonimously clicking the (+) button and no need of account. In relation to the exact position we think a nearby location can be choosen. Odors spread so we think It's not necessary to be the exact position (what do you think?) The blurring option would be great but we're technically unable of such an improvement. Jeff those contacts can be useful but we're using the free plan and we're not sure if It's possible there. A seflhosted installation would be needed.

There's a new report on the map by a third party Zengirl2,you can check it as It's anonymous. In relation to anonimity we are not sure how the IP's are managed by ushahidi. Let us check it. But If the anonimity question is related to the accounts, theres's no need of account and no contact is requested on the survey ;)

In relation to the Alfa or beta stage we can decide it togheter in this thread. We just launched it following the paper log to test it. 

Smoke and Animal waste incorporated ;D

And please amigas, present it al over the galaxy!!
