I've been experimenting with lots of things... I ended up getting sucked up into the world of photography as a result. (Which covers a lot of this). I've been messing about with glue sticks and hot glue guns as a result. (You can use the hot glue to make filters + a little pigment to make a filter blocking out the colour of your choice).
