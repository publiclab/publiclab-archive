**Session idea**: Is it a good idea to start a business designing, manufacturing, and selling environmental science tools? (30 minutes?)  

A few years ago, I started an online store to sell my kits to make aerial photography rigs ([The KAPtery](http://kaptery.com/)). We can take a look at the stuff required to run this store (it now includes kits for electronic devices), and talk about which part of the process (design, manufacture, or selling) is more fun.

*A shipment of KAPtery rigs headed for [Ennapurna](http://www.ennapurna.com/accessoires/photographie-aerienne-kap.html), a retailer in France.*  


If anyone wants to build one of the KAPtery kits, let me know which one before September 24 (Sunday) and you can take one home for 30% off the retail price.
