I looked up what government agency deals with housing in Ontario: https://www.ontario.ca/page/solve-disagreement-your-landlord-or-tenant : 
This statute lists responsbilities of landlord: https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/06r17 (do a Find in page for "sewage" and see that the landlord is responsible for sewage disposal). 

Have you written a letter or email to the landlord documenting your request in writing? This government site says you should do that. Then, if no response, the website says: 

>If you tried to contact your landlord or tenant and still canâ€™t solve the problem, call us at:
