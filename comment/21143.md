Hi! I think most webcams can't see much lower than 400nm, but if your sample flouresces in the visible range, you can read that...
  

There's been some tests to see if certain image sensors (rear-illuminated CMOS) can sense lower than that, but glass blocks most of it, so there might have to be non-glass (pinhole?) optics... and there is sometimes glass over the sensor. So it quickly becomes pretty complex!
