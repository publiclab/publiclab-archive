Hi [@bronwen](/profile/bronwen). Thanks for the helpful comment. We are currently building the first one in Berlin, with the goal of learning and providing some monitoring of the canals and the spree. I expect to build at least one more after that in the upper paraguay river, and quite happy to help support others in doing the same.

Agree that MDF is very very far from ideal, it is however thrown out in incredible amounts by convention centers in a way that does make it rather inexpensive. Note it plays no structural role in the craft at all (that is all the scaffolding.) I am running some tests of the MDF wrapped in truck tarp as a roof of a shed. Right now after about a year and a bit in it seems to be holding up. I am super keen to hear of other materials that could substitute in for it.
