I especially wanted to note the shift, which was a major breakthrough of the [DIAL UI project](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/04-22-2019/user-interface-projects-update-and-dial-osc-project-recap), away from listing all **posts** in a single "firehose," and towards displaying our **topics**. This has some really serious and excellent ramifications:

1. It presents Topics (formerly Tags) as a set of topically-focused communities, essentially like a forum. This is reflected in the card design for Topics.
2. It orients many things around these Topics, like creating a post (within a topic, rather than just on anything), Subscribing, and may even be part of future plans for spam management (just within a topic you're "moderator" in, perhaps?). Wikis may start to "live inside" topics, conceptually. 

This is all still evolving, but is an important part of our Style Guide so we'd love to hear input.
