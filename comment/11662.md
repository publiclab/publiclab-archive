Chris Fastie would not miss iFarm even for a trip to NOLA (unless unlimited Bywater Bombers were promised). Jeff do you still have the poster about NDVI cover crop trials at the first iFarm (the first flight of the Public Lab dual-camera IR rig with MK111 timer)? IFarm 2015 could see the first flight of the pan/tilt Saturn V rig with SkySweep controller. Too bad you have to leave early.
