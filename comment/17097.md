Oh, didn't see your other comment.  Both versions of Python are not necessary in the strictest sense.  What I meant was that since I'll be using 2.7 in future tutorials, one should install both so as to make the tutorials as 'plug n' play" as possible.  When I first got into data science, 2.7 was recommended but that was two years ago so that thinking may have changed.  Switching to 3.5 would certainly make working with unicode easier!  That said, this is the first time two years that I have ever encountered the need for 3.5.  I was really pleased that Anaconda implemented switching so easily.  It is probably good practice to use virtual environments anyway.
