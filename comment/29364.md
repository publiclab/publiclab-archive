Week nine update: My Honors Research Grant Proposal has been submitted! I reached out to a professor at UMass in the Integrated Science Building and discussed the future use of an on-campus incubator for growing the bacteria I will be swabbing on my instrument before and after use. I am planning on meeting with another faculty member for a tour of the 3D printer in the UMass Makerspace next week.
