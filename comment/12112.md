Hi - I actually thought I posted this a few days ago but for some reason I guess it didn't work. Now when I post it I see that the comments are interpreted as markdown syntax so pasting the code here doesn't work.  I posted the script to our server and you should be able to access it by going to: https://resources.cbc.amnh.org/cbccloudstorage/index.php/apps/files/?dir=%2FR_scripts. The password is calibrate.

That R script is the one I used to calibrate JPEG images. This is a work in progress and not really refined enough for broad public use but I'm happy to field questions or take suggestions.
