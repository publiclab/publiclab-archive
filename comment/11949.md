Hi - I think the sensing speed is affected by both:

* how well the thermistor is in contace with the water
* how much thermally conductive material is in contact with the thermistor

By the latter I mean that if the thermistor has a heat sink of any kind, it will have thermal inertia and will not change temperature quickly. So it may not be the sensor being slow but rather the mass it's attached to changing temperature slowly because it has too high a heat capacity.

Does that make sense? What was your setup?
