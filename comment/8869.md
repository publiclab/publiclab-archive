It seems like there are a lot of people who are worried about living in a dusty environment, but most of us already know whether it's dusty where we live. So making something blink or buzz when there is dust may not be as important as collecting time series data about how dusty it is. Those data can be used to demonstrate to others how dusty it is so that maybe something will be done about it. 

A device that collects a few weeks worth of dustiness data could be valuable. If it's cheap enough so that replication can be done and distance from source can be described with a transect or array of many devices, it becomes more powerful. The ability to add other sensors might allow correlating dust events with dust forming events, for example crude audio data could record when trucks went past on dusty roads. Other sensors will be more effective in other situations. But other sensors can be deployed independently, they don't have to be on the dust device. It might be most important to make a recording dust sensor as cheaply as possible so more people can have more of them.
