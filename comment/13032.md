Thanks Erwan,

It looks like awb_gains allows the red and blue channels to be adjusted relative to one another which is just what is needed. However, the adjustment apparently applies to auto white balance not to a fixed white balance. So you can make the red channel brighter (which you would want for a blue filter), but the camera will continue to adjust the white balance for each photo. So that could probably produce better photos for converting directly to NDVI using a red or blue filter. But the results could vary with each photo, so NDVI values could not be compared among different images.
