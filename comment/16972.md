The kit is fully enclosed with LED with a certain blue and red ratio (I have to verify what the exact ratio is). This brings me to the conclusion that it might not even be possible as chances are that there is almost none NIR emitted from the LED's. I assume that the plants would have to be taken outside to make the pictures. I'll try to contact Ned Horning and scan through his posts to see what is possible, I think we'll need more support to get this feature going. Again thanks for your elaborate response.
