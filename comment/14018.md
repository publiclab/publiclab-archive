Funding certainly comes into play. [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) and I just had this conversation.  Someone at the NEJAC meeting pointed out that the DOT (one of the agencies the environmental justice issue falls under) can sometimes be more responsive on EJ issues than the EPA. [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) pointed out that DOT funding is based on building projects rather than regulating so they are more apt to be financially supported and thus, perhaps more responsive.
