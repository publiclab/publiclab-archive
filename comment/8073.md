Yes - you could make a page at http://publiclab.org/wiki/dustduino and tag that?

I'm curious about two things - would this be appropriate for detecting silica particulate pollution, for communities with silicosis problems? And do you think that by skipping the wifi module and perhaps using a TinyDuino or something similar, we could cut the cost more? Tinyduino and digispark are like $12 vs Arduino's $40, and the wifi is $34; do you think a reasonable "low-end" pricepoint could be... ~$45?
