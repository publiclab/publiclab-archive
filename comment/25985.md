cfastie
First of all, many thanks about your answer! And time to answer!
You said
"But if the microcontroller can send a DONE signal as soon as the enable pin is set to high, then the TPL5111 could work to send a pulse every eight seconds."
Sorry, i can do it! My processor does not have free GPIOS :(
Can you give some low power solution ? I was thinkg to use PIC12LF to solve that!
Thank you so much!
