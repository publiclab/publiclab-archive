P.S. I dig your photo.  I have independently come to the solution of mounting the unit to wood that is stuck into the ground.  This is alright for short term applications where the homeowner wants as few holes in their vapor barrier as possible.  

Recognize that wood in the ground can be a vector for termites and rot, but usually, purple air deployments are short term enough to avoid those concerns. If the homeowner is concerned about such, metal flashing, or distancing the wood mount slightly away from the building structure avoids the moisture connection.
