This is a great question. I don’t have much information about how these photos were made, but I will make some assumptions. I assume the Pi NoIR camera (with no IR cut filter) did not have any other filter added to it (because no mention was made of an added filter). So the photos taken are color photos (three channels: R, G, B) and each channel captures one color (R, G, or B) plus lots of the near infrared in the scene. So each channel is a mix of visible light of one color and near infrared light. (Cameras have an IR cut filter because silicon sensors are sensitive to near IR which would ruin the photos.) There is also no information about how much of the light captured in each channel is visible vs. NIR.

Producing NDVI images requires two photos (or channels) of the same scene: one visible and one near infrared. If my assumptions are correct, you don’t have this and cannot make NDVI images.

If my assumptions are not correct, my answer should be very different.
