Thank you so much [@warren](/profile/warren) [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) !

[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) I am using mobius actioncam. So I am using modified mobius camera from public lab. i have read some manuals here and experimented myself and finally settled with (R-250, G-500, B-900). Do you have any suggestions?
