Hello Chris - I think you hit on a separate issue of "sanitizing" comment display, which is being worked on by a new contributor in this issue: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/3549

I'd like to note to everyone that it really makes a difference to new contributors to be friendly -- that's a large part of why they come to help out. I'm sure they appreciate your testing out new features they've made, but we work hard to be sure people feel welcome -- please don't forget to give these young people an encouraging word from time to time! I'm sure they'd love to hear it. 

I've removed the segment of your comment that caused the rest of the page to be hidden and will note the content (saved here: https://gist.github.com/jywarren/dcee2c01d2dcfb969845d89374848fa1) to some of the folks working on it. Thanks for giving it a try!
