Hello Rebeccah!
I'm interested in replicating this experiment! The biggest thing I am unsure about is the code - can you link to the riffle code you used, and any other experimental procedures you came up with? (Types of standard solutions, etc). 

Last thing - is that a common procedure to put the electrodes in DI water between measurements? I can't remember that much detail about my last lab experiences.

Thanks!
