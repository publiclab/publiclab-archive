The Nitrogen Cycle (FADAND):  

Fixation – conversion of nitrogen into a usable form of energy 

Assimilation - The absorption and digestion of food or nutrients by the body or any biological system.  

Decomposition – when dead matter breaks down by a decomposer to return the nutrients back in the energy cycle.  

Ammonification - the process where microscopic organisms like bacteria or other types of decomposing organism break down nitrogen. 

Nitrification is where ammonia is converted into nitrite.   

Denitrification is where nitrate is converted back into a gaseous state N2
