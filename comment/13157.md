Awesome ideas, y'all!
Mainly I was trying to get the protection centered on the lens, and to get the thing to roll, not resist with rigid protection. That was the thought experiment. And the other assumption was that if it was oriented (hung off a pendulum so the "butt" piece faced the operator, then when the rig was coming in for a landing, the operator could prevent a "header" by yanking on the string, so the rig would slide on the legs like a travois, or worst case, land as shown, with the legs protecting the lens.

Anyway, lots of cool ideas here. Thanks!
