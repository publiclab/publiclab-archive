This is an amazing project Hagit. You all might know of or be interested in the three-volume Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project, which 'pioneered the use of individual map biographies. In these, ‘‘hunters, trappers, fishermen, and berry pickers mapped out all the land they had ever used in their lifetimes, encircling hunting areas species by species, marking gathering locations and camping sites – everything their life on the land had entailed that could be marked on a map.’’' (quote from Critical Cartography by Denis Wood & John Krygier)
