[@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) is right, there is no low cost speciation of dust particles. That is usually done in a mass spectrometer or x-ray diffraction spectrometer in a lab. To extrapolate to concentration you'll need to use a dichotomous sampler with a cyclone or impactor that separates particles by side and deposits them on filters.  Generally at least a 24-hour sample is needed to do speciation.

here is a brief summary of several low-cost and DIY optical particle sensors including the Speck.  The Dylos 1100 is similarly priced.  as [@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) said, that's not an endorsement.
