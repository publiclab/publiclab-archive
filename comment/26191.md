> Hi, I believe I remember [@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) saying that it provided a substrate for bacteria to grow - lots of surface area -- and retains moisture. I think it probably works better for both these purposes than glass marbles, but I wonder if you could use just normal gravel instead of the "puffed rock" which was specified in the kit? The puffed rock is like lava rock - very porous and full of microscopic holes!
