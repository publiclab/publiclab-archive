When I click on the buttons for changing the frequency and speed, there are always the same values. speed 441  - What is it ? boudrate   default ?
But  boudrate speed very  high of default not  441.

I opened the demo pages :https://webjack.io/examples/?
on my computer and on my phone and turned on the speakers.
I transmit from the phone, receive it on the computer and see that the spectrogram hears a signal on the computer, but nothing is displayed in the window.
