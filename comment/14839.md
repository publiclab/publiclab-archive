[@stoft](/profile/stoft) Hey Dave I thought you might find this interesting. I did an integration time capture of my 405nm laser and the 532nm laser because I wanted to experiment with the wavenumber and transmission/reflection aspect of spekwin32 and see if I could calculate the integration times of both lasers through an empty quartz cuvette.

The 405nm UV laser pointer has an integration time of 245.46 m/s and the 532nm laser is 189.41 m/s
