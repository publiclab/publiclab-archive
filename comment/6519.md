Hi cfastie.
Thanks! The water I tested came from the faucet in Stockholm, Sweden. The water treating plants here have a hard time filtrating medicinal, contraceptive and chemical residue. Besides that after the water is treated it travels through mile long old pipes that often had been repaired with led and along the way pick up particulate matter. Chlorine is also added to the water. The filter I use will filter everything except for chlorine, instead it will add an extra electron (Cl--->Cl-) and turn it into Chloride. The filtered water in this test is supposed not to contain any particulates and chemical residue.
