The costal restoration project will have positive and negative effects on the Louisiana ecosystem. The land will act as barriers for hurricanes. The barriers will slow down hurricanes, decreasing damage inland. However, freshwater is needed to restore the cost, but the project is implemented by the Gulf of Mexico which is saltwater. Species such as Gulf killifish, Sheepshead minnow, Oyster killifish, Diamond killifish, Brown shrimp, and White shrimp will be driven further out to sea to settle in water with a higher salt content since the Gulf has been diluted. This is an example of secondary ecological succession because there is a community already established in the Gulf of Mexico, and this community will be negatively impacted by the restoration project.*Gianna Williams*
