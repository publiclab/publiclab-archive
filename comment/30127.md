Hi [@simransia07](/profile/simransia07), I like your mock-ups:  I like that you included  the columns sizes. I like the in-depth explanations you gave  in your solutions, the code snippets and the explanations on your mock-ups is really great and helpful ‚ù§Ô∏è I love your "project description" I liked that you explained the project in your own words and understanding ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è . Your proposal is so clear and detailed, really great proposal üéâ üéâ 

One thing to think about is the shade of blue used in the footer, I think it might too bright to be used as a bg-color on the places you have used it ..what do you think?. I do not expect you to edit the images just something to think/discuss on.

Thanks for posting
