I'm going to jump again in as a contrarian, but with a purpose (hopefully it will help).  My intent is to step lightly, but I may step on everyone's toes a bit.  Please don't take it personally...

As in all things, I am just a layman (IANAL), so take this as just commentary.

The context of this article, and the focus of my approach to it, is the battlefield that is the court proceeding.  The scenario wherein a Public Lab member will find themselves in such an environment is, I imagine, something like this:  Public Lab member [@envwatcher](/profile/envwatcher) takes an interest in the environmental goings-on in a particular geographic area.  Maybe [@envwatcher](/profile/envwatcher) is called in because someone else is looking at environmental damage; maybe something happens in an area for which [@envwatcher](/profile/envwatcher) is already gathering data; or, possibly, [@envwatcher](/profile/envwatcher) is looking through data from others and comes up with something interesting or probative.

For whatever reason, [@envwatcher](/profile/envwatcher) finds [his/her]self talking to an attorney who is putting together a case.  (Again, who initiates that contact can go either way).  IMHO opinion, a "good" attorney will look at the data and [@envwatcher](/profile/envwatcher) with a critical eye, trying to figure out how the data, methods, and conclusions fit into the narrative that the attorney is building.  The narrative is important, because it is how the case will be handled in many ways:  The filing, the presentation of the evidence (all types), the fight for summary judgement (US law--we're talking a civil suit of some kind.  Criminal law is something else, and I'm not going to even pretend to explain how that might work.), and the relief (injunctions and/or damages) that will be the result of a successful case.

The narrative is also important because the opposing attorney(s) will be trying to tear it down.  This is where the critical eye I mentioned comes up:  A "good" attorney will be looking at not only the data and conclusions, but also the person who will probably end up explaining it to the court.  Does this person sound knowledgeable? Is there an obvious ax that they are grinding that the opposing counsel will use to beat up the witness?  Do they know their stuff?  Lots more questions that I couldn't even imagine.

Here's where the discussion comes back to this comment thread:  Our intrepid potential witness, [@envwatcher](/profile/envwatcher), is a member of Public Lab.  What is Public Lab?  Is it a group of amateur scientists?  Professional scientists? Is it an environmental advocacy group?  A bit of each?  Do member fall into separate categories (and across categories) based on their personal interests?

This comment thread (and some others) seems to expose, to me, an uncertainty in the community regarding what Public Lab, as a whole, is or could be.  For myself, it's more of a "power to the people" thing, technologically speaking.  If you create enough low-cost tools that allow people to do interesting and amazing things, then the world, as a whole is better.  A few years ago I was playing with the idea of designing my own arduino-based ultrasound.  My wife had had a serious ectopic pregnancy that almost killed her, and I was amazed at both the expense and complexity of the systems.  Turns out they are becoming [serious items](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19963733), and I call that a good thing.

This is not necessarily a "pure" approach to Public Lab, however.  Equipment, systems, and people cost money, and it would be very easy to morph from a "power to the people" environment to a "and we can be popular (and/or make money)!" mindset that would be corrosive over time.

Alternatively, there is definitely a reason for pushing the scientific aspect of Public Lab.  As I mentioned in my earlier comment, knowing the tolerances and principles of the equipment and methods is very important.  Wild-ass pronouncements and unfounded declarations hurt any good that Public Lab can do, and this part of the community is absolutely necessary.

However, cloning the approach of the established scientific community has its drawbacks.  While users are arguing over how many angstroms can dance on the head of a pin, the real world is happening, and lots of good that can be done will be back-burnered and, possibly, too late.  Also, as [@liz](/profile/liz)'s article from earlier pointed out, peer review can lead to a pretty stifled culture that moves slowly in a quickly shifting world.

Then there are environmental advocates in Public Lab.  I would present a caricature of this member as someone who has a deep felt belief in a position ("Waterway spill X caused serious environmental damage"), and is looking for proof of their belief.  This approach would often be the reason that [@envwatcher](/profile/envwatcher) is getting involved in the first place.  They have an interest and care, and are willing to put in the time to monitor an area that no one else has the time, money, or interest in looking.  It's actually the basis for growing Public Lab--people who care about their environment.

Unchecked, though, can be dangerous in that a frothing-at-the-mouth environmentalist won't even get to present evidence.  It's too obvious that the belief outweighs the approach, and I would imagine that attorneys would get the idea that Public Lab members are to be avoided.

So while the debate rages on over which aspect of Public Lab is "most" important, I think that we should understand that Public Lab itself interests people because it does not fall into any category as a whole.  We already have the academic scientific community, Silicon Valley "cause" startups, and long-standing environmental watch dogs.  If someone is coming to Public Lab, it may be because they find down-sides to those other groups, and they see somewhere that they can fit in without having to swear allegiances that they are unable to support or have reservations about.

The "battlefield" I referenced earlier is about people and evidence.  It's also where real change comes about.  It doesn't matter that people "knew" that lead-based paint is dangerous--it mattered that the cost of the product became too high because of court cases and EPA fines.  This is the larger good that I would like to promote.  But it can't happen without a balanced community that cares enough to look, is careful enough to build a solid base, and enjoys the technical challenges enough to invent new ways to go about things.

Just my inflation-adjusted $0.02, also...
