David,  
When using a blue (#2007) filter, the red channel records NIR and the blue channel records visible blue light which is used to compute NDVI. Water absorbs NIR two orders of magnitude more strongly than it absorbs blue light. It will  be very difficult to capture a photograph which has good information about both blue and NIR because one of those channels will typically be either overexposed or underexposed.

*[Light absorption coefficient of pure water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Water_absorption_coefficient_large.gif). The absorption coefficient (y axis) is a log scale so NIR light (e.g. 760 nm) is absorbed 10 times faster than orange light (625 nm).*  

Below is the color histogram of the  bluish photo you included in your note. The blue channel (which records visible blue light) is completely overexposed (pegged at ~255). All the pixels in the photo essentially have the same value for blue, and that value is used to compute all the NDVI values.

*Histogram of the bluish photo in the note. The blue channel is severely overexposed.*

It should be possible to take a photo with less overexposure in the blue channel and not too much under-exposure in the red (NIR) channel. It will help to shoot through as little water as possible. It might not be possible to get NDVI results similar to those from plants in air, but your results could still have meaning when compared with themselves.
