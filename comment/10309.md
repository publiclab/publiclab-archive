[@Kentells](/profile/Kentells) - I haven't quite finished yet... But I started in late June...I would hate to even think how many hours I've spent on this so far..  Let's just say, a LOT..  And probably double that by the time I'll be done.  Price, since it's not totally done.......I'd have to guess about $1000 so far... but that's been my investment.. If someone else were to build one, not having to do all the research and make the same mistakes... it'd be closer to $600..  Most of that is optics, so if you can source cheaper optics than what I bought from edmund..it'd be cheaper..and for a raman system - $600 is pretty cheap..  I'm also going to guess that with all the parts in front of you...including the printed ones...one could put this together in around a week of casual work..not including calibration and alignment..  ;)  The spectrometer portion alone takes my daVinci 3D printer about 15 hours, set to print in high quality set on the fast speed...
Thanks, I hope it gets even better with time!
