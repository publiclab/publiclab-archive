This comment thread has veered away from the original idea that I had and discussed with Mathew of collaborative social events that produce documentation, which is fine. So let's consider how to support solo writing and "encourage periodic iterative improvement" as [@warren](/profile/warren) says. Should we inaugurate something like "Edit Fridays" as a regular calendar event that encourages individuals to push their progress into the knowledge base?
