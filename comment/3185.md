Adam,  That's right, a narrower entrance slit allows emission or absorption lines to be resolved better. So you can know more precisely the wavelength of that line, and so you can distinguish two lines that are close together. And yes, a narrower slit also allows less light to enter so the spectrum is dimmer.  But generally all of the spectral lines will be dimmed by the same amount, so the relationship among line intensities (peak heights) within a spectrum doesn't necessarily change. 

The absolute intensities of the peaks will change, but controlling that is devilish. Its very hard even to control the amount of light radiating from the source (e.g., a CFL bulb has to warm up, be a certain distance from the spectrometer, and be aligned perfectly with the slit and grating). With cameras that have automatic exposure control, making two spectra minutes apart that have identical peak heights is a challenge. So calibrating the PLOTS spectrometer for intensity (peak height) is an advanced topic and requires a solid laboratory bench setup. I am not sure why you would want to be able to compare intensities among multiple spectrometers.

In many cases, the location of the emission or absorption line is the key data, how intense the line is might be less important. In some cases the relative change in intensity (e.g., due to absorption of light by a sample) will be adequate, so absolute intensity calibration is not needed.

A problem with a narrower slit is that the camera won't record anything if the light is too dim. But in some lab situations when capturing still images, you can make as long an exposure as needed and record a good spectrum with an extremely narrow slit.  That requires a camera with complete manual control. 

It is not a problem that some spectrometers have narrower slits than others.  Some spectrometers will produce higher resolution data than others, so one spectrometer will be able to resolve two nearby peaks that another spectrometer records as one peak.  As you point out, the absolute intensities (peak heights) of these two spectrometers will not be comparable without some additional control, but I am not sure what application requires calibrating multiple spectrometers for intensity. 

If you have two spectra of the same light source that you want to compare, and one is dim (low peaks) and the other bright (tall peaks), you can always export the data from Spectral Workbench into Excel and find a function that increases the dim peaks so they match the bright ones. Or add code to the Spectral Workbench sets viewer that allows applying a function to each spectrum. I am not sure what application would require that.
