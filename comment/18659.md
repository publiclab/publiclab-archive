Also it's really exciting to have Python API code. Perhaps if you're interested we could host it as the "official" python API interface for SpectralWorkbench (whatever that means :-P) -- maybe "recommended" is the better word -- and list it for Python folks to use alongside SpectralWorkbench.js. So maybe `spectral-workbench.py`? Awesome!
