Kudos all around for a great site!

1. I love the Notes and feel guilty I'm in the 80th percentile of lurkers--will have to post something.
2. Wiki pages are nice but I can't help but think that rather than being the "information super highway" people intended, they are more like "information parking lots" of the internet.  There seem to be about 900 wikis?  Some have good content but it's hard to find wikis of value unless it's referenced in a Note.
3. Then what about PLOTS google groups?  It's like the legacy Q&A section that I keep forgetting even exists.  I think the groups could be reincarnated as a front page Q&A section.
4. And lastly, another need would be for announcements and events.  For example, EPA is holding a live [webinar on citizen science air monitoring on July 9th](http://www.epa.gov/heasd/documents/CommunityAirMonitoringTraining_Webinar_Announcement.pdf) but I don't know how to convey stuff like this.
