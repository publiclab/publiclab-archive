Just on a couple of Liz's comments:

1. causes -- i like this too. Perhaps just below it, instead of a search box, we could list 8 or more additional popular ones and a link that says `More issues` or `More causes` as you prefer, leading to `/tags` (which is the subject of an upcoming UI project. For an example of such a list, see the newest front page, at https://publiclab.org/home, where there's a list of blue "labels" for different issues.  
2. re: store, I guess I agree with Liz that this space might be used for `Methods` although in general I think `Methods` may have lower priority than `Causes/Issues`. 
3. Could the 3 "causes" each have a heading like "Air quality" "Water quality" ... not sure of the third, maybe "Waste"?

More in a sec.
