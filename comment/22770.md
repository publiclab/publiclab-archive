The general principles discussed in this wiki would apply for hydrogen sulfide sampling too: https://publiclab.org/wiki/general-environmental-monitoring-study-strategies. Also, check out the Geographic Scope section in this broader wiki: 
https://publiclab.org/wiki/start-enviro-monitor-study#Geographic+Scope.  One key thing to remember when looking to monitor for hydrogen sulfide is to also have a field reference sample (in a place that is expected to not have hydrogen sulfide), and that if you're looking to assess the influence of a specific site (e.g. a gas pad, a landfill, etc), then you'll definitely want to select at least a few sampling sites including ones upwind and ones downwind of the site of concern.
