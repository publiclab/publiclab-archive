These are all very good NDVI images. The NDVI values seem to be close to the correct range, and there are not that many anomalies (most leaves are green and few non-leaves are green). Healthy foliage should probably have NDVI values closer to 5, so maybe there should be more yellow in the images. But the absolute values for NDVI will always be shifted unless a calibration procedure is used. The protocol you are using has great potential to make useful NDVI maps of farm fields.
