Anyway, Jeff

I was thinking  of using this as a possible screening tool with the ongoing PM sampling  that we are doing in Plaquemines, in preparation for the Coal export dumping that is about to go down, due to the environmental victories in the NW against coal exports, and the pending Tar Sands refining that is going to produce large amounts of petroleum coke.

That drum sampler counts pm, but also comes with a lab that is identifying silicate, i think, from the physical samples.  So perhaps if the dust duino code could spit out raw data from the sensor, some genius could re-interpret that raw data compared to the silica data we are getting with the other machine. 

Because of the high expense (the drum monitor is $25k / 60 samples / year, for one machine) there's usually a limit to community monitoring, decisions have to be made about which community gets to use the machine...I'm hoping this could be both  a low-cost tool that gives us more coverage, plus a way to avoid that kind of inter-community tension in "who gets the monitor" for five different communities, all of whom are suffering from asthma and dust, etc.
