Hi Jim,
Thanks for the interest and the emails. The event is free to show up to if you want to meet at the time and place. There isn't a registration page since this is mostly for the journalists that we are bringing into town. We will be headed in that direction from Marin so I hope that the timing sticks.If you want to send me your number in an email I can update you on the progress. 

This also applies to anyone else who is local and interested in attending.
