Tilapia cleans after catfish. However, catfish predates on tilapia. Both can live in the same area if tilapia is introduced after the catfish have grown to a larger size. Both populations can coexist within an ecosystem or farm. Commensalism is the relationship between farm raised catfish and tilapia. Catfish benefits from tilapia, while the tilapia is neither helped nor harmed.
