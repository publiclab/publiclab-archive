Good points Chris.  I hadn't thought of it before but this all depends on the size of the individual sensor elements, the width of the line, and the dispersion of your particular spectrometer.  For a low dispersion spectrometer there would be a lot of spill over into adjacent pixels but for high dispersion and small sensor elements there wouldn't be so much.
