Yeah my comment came out odd due to markdown -- the underscore is present in both the Arduino code and the script.

I was wondering whether it was some sort of issue with grabbing continuous data, but even when I switch to using a button so I can grab a single data point, the same thing happens.

Not a huge issue for what we're doing tonight, but maybe we can pick Will's brain when he's back in action.
