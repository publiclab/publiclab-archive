Thanks, [@amirberAgain](/profile/amirberAgain) - i think the event might be a bit tight on time but we should try to get a follow-up e-meeting for the images we take during the event perhaps? 

I also noticed [@ag8n](/profile/ag8n) has been finding some good reference images for silica/non-silica particles that we can use for comparison, [in this question](https://publiclab.org/questions/Ag8n/02-21-2018/have-you-used-the-particle-atlas). I'd love to have some good pictures to have on hand as we're actually viewing through the microscopes.
