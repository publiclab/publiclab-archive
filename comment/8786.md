Hi **unmanaged** -- it'd be *great* to have you as a beta tester!  We're going to be ordering a new round of prototypes very soon, and we're hoping to have some in during the next few weeks.  And: we'd *love* to see what you're up to, if you have some time to share your own work (photos, diagrams) on publiclab.org as well -- it'd  certainly be helpful to see your approach.  

Great suggestions on the stainless steel welding rods.  We've got some stainless steel screws coming in from McMaster-Carr tomorrow, and we're hoping that these will will make for some nice, cheap electrodes ...  Stay in touch!
