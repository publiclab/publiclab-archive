Plants, especially trees and fragrant species, as well as decaying plant matter, emit biogenic VOCs. Some species of eucalyptus are known to emit harmful levels of VOCs. NOx, when combined with anthropogenic and biogenic VOCs, produces ground-level ozone. Ozone can aggravate asthma and irritate lungs.
