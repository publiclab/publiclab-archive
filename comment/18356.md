Hello [@xose](/profile/xose)
I tried mapknitter some time a go. I think is a great software and very easy to use if you want to knit a few photos. In my case most of the times a walk up and down the field taking photos with the kite or sometimes use a drone, so I may finish with about 250 photos of a field. That is the reason why I use Autodesk Recap, or Drone Deploy to create the orthomosaic. In some cases Image Composite editor give me very good results being quicker and totally free. Once I got the orthomosaic I correct and georeference it in Arcgis or in Qgis.
