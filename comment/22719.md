I've done spectrometer building with people -- that works pretty well, although it's good to practice first. Balloon mapping is a bit much for 30 minutes. 

You could also bring some UV lights and look at whether things fluoresce or not? Pond water might fluoresce due to vegetation or microbes, or due to oil. Could be interesting to compare -- you could use this nail polish hardening UV light which is UV powered: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/03-10-2016/honlian-60s-led-nail-polish-hardener-various-led-fluorescence-updates
