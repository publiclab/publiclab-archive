Yes, it was curved but I edited the image, may be too much in this post. I put another post named 3new  spectrum of a 7w... but it has desapeared I think, This were the final photo I took without any edition, I just  cut it. As I said I put it in another post with very little edition but I can't see it now. I don't mannage very well with this. I took the photo just with a bq aquarius, and I made a box with black cardboard, a small and thin hole in one side and a piece of CD in the other. It was not a cubed box, it was alongate, and the results as you see were pretty good. I hope you can see them
