[@stoft](/profile/stoft), I agree with what you are saying, and have a personal interest in helping to make that happen.  Without a means of narrowing down PLab searches in a way that highlights useful/relevant/valuable material, it's no better than hit-and-miss on a Google/Bing search (not knocking them--but they are built for the general web, not to support PublicLab's goals).

OTOH, how you do it (and what effect it has on the community as a whole) is what [@warren](/profile/warren) is talking about.  

I think that everyone would agree that this is fundamentally important, from whichever part of the rigor spectrum you approach this.  I'm looking forward to the OpenHour discussion.
