Specifically, I think we need to encourage people to structure experiments around what these cameras do best at the moment -- comparisons between vegetation under identical lighting -- and to make make quantitative comparisons in those scenarios. Without Ned's absolute calibration, we can't do other kinds of analysis, but it's suitable for many things as long as people understand its limits. 

Yeah, I think the new camera tests have been a bit disorganized, with nobody taking lead on the idea of testing red filters. If we asked the Kits team to ship them to somebody else who's willing, would images such as the above ones I took (keeping the originals) be suitable for assessing? We could ask on the mailing list for a volunteer.
