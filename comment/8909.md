Scott,  
If you still have that RC controlled KAP rig, there is another option for syncing the VIS and NIR cameras in your dual camera rig. The radio receiver that goes on the KAP rig outputs a signal that will trigger the shutter. You need CHDK on the camera so it knows what to do with that signal, and the only other thing you need is a Y cable to split the signal from the receiver to the two cameras. Then you can trigger both cameras simultaneously from the ground by sending two pulses a few seconds apart (one to get ready, the second to shoot).
