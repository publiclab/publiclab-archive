I reported a lensing effect from the curved top of the gel caps, and wanted to answer the question of whether the fluorescence could be improved if the top wasn't curved.  I made a small tray for open gel caps and did another olive oil test.  The results matched identically to the [#4](/n/4) closed cap:

Results match the closed [#4](/n/4) cap almost exactly.

I then tried to see if it would improve the results with bigger caps, like the 0 size.  nope, no measureable fluorescence, even with the lensing effect gone.
