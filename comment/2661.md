I have comparative images online:
https://spectralworkbench.org/spectra/show/1131  with extra focus lens
https://spectralworkbench.org/spectra/show/1143  no extra focus lens

Unfortunately the two spectra are at significantly different intensities and therefore hard to compare.  I think I made my judgement based on examining the spectra with my webcam viewing program as opposed to uploaded spectra.

A better spectrum was obtained by narrowing the slit as seen in:
https://spectralworkbench.org/spectra/show/1144
I made the narrower slit by attaching aluminum tape to a microscope slide and and cutting a slit of say 1 mm width and then, while looking with my eye at the illuminated slit in the black paper, I slid the microscope slide back and forth along the front edge of the vhs box to get the proper alignment to form a narrow slit and then taped the microscope slide in place.
