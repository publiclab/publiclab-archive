 "I can add a "use recent calibration" checkbox to the image upload form to streamline this if it's interesting to you."

yes, that would be great. At the moment we can capture a spectra onlne, but unless we have the Hg lines on it, I didn't see  way of working out the wavelength of the lines it shows. I thought it was just me being a numbskull and not working out how to save a calibration properly :)

"One question however...I noticed that the dvd-r had a purple tint to it instead of the normal colorless polycarbonate. The dye is usually purple and I am wondering if you cleaned the DVD off before trying this (isopropanol/ethanol works well). Regardless your lines were quite nice."

good point ! a fine observation. You are correct, I didn't clean the DVD plastic at all. I tried to take a slab of plastic without too much dye on it. I'll now go back and clean it, hopefully it will let a bit more light through as well. Thanks for that. I really should read all the instructions LoL.

thanks for the info on images Jeff. I'll get back and edit the note and replace the thumbnail links with the actual images. This is my first time playing with both google groups and this format.
