At [@LESBreathe](/profile/LESBreathe), we made a Cleaner Air at Home flyer this season with many no-cost suggestions. We're developing more ways to get it into peoples' hands and onto their screens. So far it's in Spanish and English - I'll add the text here - if you translate it, or improve it, please share it. 

Cleaner Air at Home
 by LES Breathe 

1. Clean regularly
Leave your shoes at the door - an easy step for a cleaner home
Dust, sweep & vacuum - a HEPA filtered vacuum is suggested
Wash your linens and sheets  - hot water effectively reduces dust mites
Remove old food - for less mold, pests & odors

2. Let in fresh air
Check your vents - dust or vacuum them
Open a window 
Clean air conditioner filters regularly
Use an air purifier - or fit a HEPA furnace filter into your open window
Too dry for your skin and breathing?  - keep a pan or cup of water near heater

3. Minimize indoor pollutants
Avoid aerosols (sprayed products)
Avoid scented candles & cleaners- choose unscented laundry products, etc
Always use ventilation when cooking 
Use carbon monoxide detectors 

4. Form good habits
Grow houseplants that clear the air - see online at bit.ly/cleanplants
Avoid smoking or vaping indoors
Use nail polish & other chemicals outside
Close toilet lid when you flush
