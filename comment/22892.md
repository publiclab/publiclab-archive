Spectrometers based on consumer cameras, like the Public Lab spectrometers, can be built so they provide good information about which narrow wavelength bands are present in the source light. That is, they can have 2-3 nm resolution on the wavelength scale. However, these spectrometers are not very good at measuring the intensity of light at each wavelength band. The values for brightness of each band will be influenced by camera hardware and software design and will be unreliable except for the most general comparisons. If only general comparisons are required for your project (e.g., that blue band is a lot brighter than that green band), this type of spectrometer might be adequate.
