Hey Matej, there's something going wrong with the way your second and third sets are showing up there! They've got all of those squiggles showing up that do not appear in the original spectra.

Compare your spectra from the first bulb, the Sylvania Daylight bulb, with this spectrum from Wikipedia of a halophosphate phosphor lightbulb (see the comment below for the image). The spectra appear different because this bulb uses a completely different set of phosphors than modern CFL bulbs. However, it still has the two mercury emission lines that are used for calibration in spectral workbench so I think it should still work to calibrate off of it.

May I ask why you are smoothing your spectra here? I don't think it is a good idea because you want to get as much resolution as possible for calibration. In your original spectra (for the CFL bulb) you can distinguish two green peaks, one at 540 and one at 545. When you smooth out your data, these two peaks get smeared together, resulting in a less accurate calibration because you are lumping together the spectral line for terbium with the mercury peak that you are actually trying to detect.
