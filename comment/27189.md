Thanks for the update John! You're right about the Meteor decoding software. I ended up partitioning my Mac because so much SDR software seems to be Windows only. I'll keep an eye out for any Mac developments. 

Also thanks for the confirmation of the performance of the RTL-SDR original dongle vs. others- [@sophied](/profile/sophied) uses the original silver-cased RTL-SDR and I use a Funcube dongle pro +. It's always interesting to hear how different dongles compare.
