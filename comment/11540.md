Hi bhickman, this info is very helpful, thank you. In reference to my other question about which energia program to run first, what I mean by that is, when taking a reading from the Diode Array, which program do I run using energia? The D_array.ino, and then run Feb_9_2014_Stellaris_DA_Spec.ino, or do I run serial_input_variables.ino, or serial_variable_conversions.ino? Or is running one program from the GUI sufficient to get info from the diode array to the computer?
