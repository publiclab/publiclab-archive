[@gretchen](/profile/gretchen) Gotcha... I don't think "knock on door" necessarily needs to go, but maybe a few more words could make it friendlier. Is it going to be on some kind of colored paper that the printing company has on file? The green on the sample is a little intense, so I might be inclined to dial that (or any color) back a little just to be a little easier on the eyes, but if you're going with stock colors, I'm guessing it will be based on whatever's in stock. If it's black-only can you still print gradients? (as/in shades of grey). Printer company specs might help to understand what design elements are possible. Thanks!
