My Memory! In Fall 2010, a group of Public Lab-ers, students from The New School, and one (or sometimes two) Newark residents attempted to map the developing riverfront in Newark, NJ. We were faced with a lot of challenges, including, but not limited to: bad weather, street traffic, balloon design, built environment, and even permitted space (a police officer may or may not have shown up to escort us off public works property). Although the end goal was never fully realized, the “Ah ha!” moment came when I started to realize that sometimes it is all about the process and the lessons we learn from each other with each step taken. That’s when I came to love Public Lab.

This picture (http://goo.gl/HMKFsG) represents that moment to me and part of why I continue to stay involved with Public Lab – it’s a group of diverse individuals working together to solve a shared problem.
