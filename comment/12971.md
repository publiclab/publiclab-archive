There are a few options for getting both a visible light image and an NIR image of the same scene. The DIY approaches vary in their ability to distinguish healthy from stressed plants. To maximize your chances of distinguishing healthy from slightly stressed plants, capturing a pure NIR image and a pure red image might be required. The most straightforward way to do that is to use two cameras each with a narrow band filter (e.g., one for red between 600 and 700nm, and one for NIR between 740 and 900 nm). Or one camera can be used and the filters switched between photos. These filters can be expensive and might require long exposures. These limitations drive most users to sacrifice analytical power, especially when trying to produce aerial NDVI images.

DIY single camera systems can simulate NDVI, but it is not possible to simultaneously capture both red and NIR images that are not cross contaminated ([e.g., more here](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/11-24-2015/dual-band-pass-filters)). The ability to detect small differences in plant stress might be compromised by this shortcoming. So if you don't need to fly the camera, a two camera system is preferable.  

Producing a time series of images of your site could enhance your ability to detect patterns. One reason is that the patterns you are looking for may be invisible to the eye, so you only know what can be revealed after you have taken the photos. If you knew when the NDVI pattern was most obvious, just one pair of photos would suffice. I am not sure about other benefits of a time lapse series of images, but it would certainly be cool to watch a video and see the patterns appear. This would require a fixed photo point and dedicated attention to the project.
