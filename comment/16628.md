here are some design precedents we were thinking with a year ago that I just sent to Christophe (we'll talk in may as he gets up to speed). 

I would love to see your ideas [@Zengirl2](/profile/Zengirl2) !

Fold1:

Fold 2:

Mailable 1:

Malleable 2

The method we use is hydroculture (to increase root airflow and decrease fungal and viral circulation) so this is the basic set up of a hydroculture pot:

often there is a plastic mesh cup like this inside a non-draining outer pot (this one retails for $0.25 but i wonder if we can make one that is more compactable (if we need that) out of a mesh suspended beneath a solid ring):

A clear or semi-transparent outer pot eliminates the need to have a water level monitor. Others have used opaque pots but drilled a hole where they wanted the high water line to be so that the water would drain out but watering it in place becomes messy. 

Figuring out the balance between a beautiful, functional, and small/cheap shipping is what we're having trouble figuring out.
