Thanks Mathew! 

Eustatic I have many more aerial photographs of that site from many angles both from this year and last. Google earth captures the disappearance of the enormous wooden quonset huts that raw sulfur, bauxite and phosphate was stored in.   Plus land based closeup of the eroding places  and will put these up as a separate research note.

I hope we hear from folks  While there are briefs, what may also be helpful is this document:

EPA's  "Pre-CERCLIS screening protocol and checklist".  http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/hrsres/fact/sascreen.pdf   
From its  Abstract
"Pre-CERCLIS screening is a review of information on potential Superfund sites to determine whether the site should be entered into EPAâ€™s Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Information System (CERCLIS).  Pre-CERCLIS screening is an initial low-cost look at potential sites to ensure that uncontaminated sites or sites ineligible under CERCLA are not unnecessarily entered into CERCLIS for further Superfund-financed assessment activities. This guidance document establishes minimum requirements for conducting pre-CERCLIS screening assessments..." End of excerpt.

"A review of information"  
As our preliminary  screening  shows the site regrettably  impacted  badly enough  to exceed those minimums   
we need to organize the information  we have accumulated since the mid 1990s about the site, so it is as easily accessible to EPA's reviewers as possible, as they work through the Checklist Questions.
 Are there types of  indexing, data visualization formats, visualizations and or more that can  help them see the details of the site as we see them?
