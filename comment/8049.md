This looks like a godsend for two similar mappings projects that I'll be posting about soon. One project will attempt to map and document the spread of invasive Asiatic Bittersweet on land, while the other will map and document declines in Clam populations. The projects will be a collaboration between a local middle school in Harpswell, Maine, the Harpswell Land Trust and the Town of Harpswell.
  As the coordinator of a Makerspace affiliated with the school, I have been helping with Balloon/Kite Mapping techniques, Robotics, Mesh Sensor Networks and IR Imaging but before they do anything they need to set up a database and a field data collection protocol for use with the iPads they have been provided with.  Rhuz looks to be everything we dreamed of and more!  
   I'll be able to post a more detailed description tomorrow as a research note, but first I wanted to check in to see if this project is still in development?
