For detecting temperature change in waterbodies, see: 

* thermal "fishing bob" $5 diy sensor, then you take a timelapse of its color change as it is dragged through the water: https://publiclab.org/tag/thermal-fishing-bob
* accessing thermal satellite LANDSAT imagery: https://publiclab.org/tag/landsat
* using a $250 smart phone add-on FLIR ONE, handheld or for aerial photography https://www.flir.com/flir-one/: https://publiclab.org/notes/John_Wells/09-20-2016/kite-aerial-remote-sensing
