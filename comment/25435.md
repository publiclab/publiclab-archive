Polymer-enzyme conjugates are investigated for applications in various areas including biocatalysis in nonaqueous media, for example, for the preparation of biosensors. In many other cases, biocompatible polymers are also used in enzyme conjugation for drug delivery. In the case of pharmaceutical industry, direct use of native enzymes barely show any detoxification effects, although enzymes are exquisite biocatalysts that decompose toxic substances. The main barrier is the instability under physiological environments. Therefore, those therapeutic enzymes are conjugated with polymer as carriers to improve the physiochemical properties.
