Hi Dave - I wanted to try out a set of tests when "reproducing and testing" the stability upgrade at the [#documentation-days](/tag/documentation-days) events on the 12th and 19th; would you be able to put up even a preliminary draft of a set of "level 2" tests we could try before and after upgrading a spectrometer, perhaps to the end of your stability upgrade post?
