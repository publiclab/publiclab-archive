What are you looking at specifically when you see that the higher frequencies are attenuated? What part of the waveform, can you highlight it?

I should have time tomorrow or Sat to test this out, i've been looking around for components to use to test it. The output of an Arduino is what, 5.5v? Or some other voltage for the serial pins? And what's the desired max for a headphone's ADC?

Thanks, Richard!
