You have to be careful on how different methods work.  The answers can vary dramatically from method to method.  For example, if atomic absorption(AA) for lead is used with a straight HCl digestion of something like clay soil, the results could  be different from if a stronger acid ( usually something like HF) is used.  This is because lead is could be tied up in the "matrix".

And if you try and compare this to something like an XRF method, the results could also could be different. There are all kinds of effects on XRF that can change the calculations. This before we talk about the concentration differences that would be seen with the soluble in insoluble lead matrix mentioned above.
