Hi! Image Sequencer's NDVI module now has a "hover to see NDVI values" feature:

https://publiclab.org/image-sequencer (see "Activities")

[Try this demo for example](https://publiclab.github.io/image-sequencer/examples/#steps=ndvi{filter:red})

Also, here are a lot of previous posts about hydroponics.

I think it may be good to consider using a more configurable camera like the Raspberry Pi camera, where you can set the camera settings very precisely. This may result in better data:
