We've been building a device based on the [riffle](http://www.publiclab.org/wiki/riffle), very similar in concept to the conductivity meter you've linked. We're using PVC pipe and our conductivity is measured using the resistance across two stainless steel screws. Our wiki needs some updating and cleanup, but you can find it [here](http://publiclab.org/wiki/riffle-esque-wq-monitoring).
