Hey Naman and Sidharth, I have done some work with Angular in the past months and agree with you that it's easy to catch for rails dev because of it's MVC-like(not fully MVC) architecture. 

This transition would bring the speed and helps in scalability so I would love to be part of this transition if PL representatives agree on this one. 

Thanks!
