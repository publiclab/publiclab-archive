Reviewing the original .svg files I see they have the size in pixels defined, not in inches or cm. So it makes the standard conversion.

Before version 0.91 inkscape converted 1 inch to 90px and viceversa. Then it converted 1 inch to 96px.

It looks like those files were made with Adobe illustrator that used an Inkscape version 0.48.3.1 ("<!-- Generator: Adobe Illustrator 16.0.0, SVG Export Plug-In . SVG Version: 6.00 Build 0)").

So, when we open those files in Inkscape it has to convert the pixels to inches or cm, and it uses that conversion. That's why the length of the box, which measures 670px if you see it in inkscape, is "translated" to cm as 18,9cm, exactly what you calculate using the 90px per inch (670 px/ 90 inch = 7,4 inch = 18.9 cm). 

I use a version 0.91 Inkscape, but it seems that it uses the conversion 1 inch = 90 px.

I think the problem might be related to that.
