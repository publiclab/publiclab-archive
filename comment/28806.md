Summary of Data Collection
A group member went to Lake Pontchartrain, where he collected two bottles of lake water. Back at school, we plugged in an electrode amplifier that measures, pH and mV (ORP). An oxidation-reduction potential sensor measures the ability of a lake or river to cleanse itself. All three of us collected separate data that we examined through our LabQuest 2 tablet. Using distilled water and lake water, we measured the pH and mV. We plugged it into the LabQuest 2 tablet, and we then put the sensor into the water and got our results. Our results varied between our tests and we made charts on levels of mV and pH in the water. The unit pH is a level that measures how a sample of water is alkaline or acidic. The higher the number the more alkaline and the lower the number the more acidic.

Another lake that is similar to Lake Pontchartrain is Lake Texoma. The average pH for Lake Pontchartrain is 7.89 and the average pH for Lake Texoma is 7.78. They also are both the same type of water which is brackish, a mixture of freshwater and saltwater. We did this experiment because we had some genuine questions that we wanted to answer and we got some of those answers. We had a good time collecting the data, and we might consider doing it again one day.
