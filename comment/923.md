Here's a much much nicer spectrum in "a little rectangular glass container" just as Chris suggested. I still can't get a strong enough light that the spectrometer detects it. I'll keep trying. Also looking for a sample of heavier oil, like motor oil, to test. Then i'll try some samples from the Gulf oil spill!
