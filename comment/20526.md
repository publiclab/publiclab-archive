I believe you are not quite correct in the determination of the AQI.  First, the downloaded data from purple air gives concentrations, for pm2.5 this is Âµg/m^3. In your explanation it seems you call the concentration the AQI and you then count AQI's between certain standard values. You are actually counting concentrations between certain values. In addition the actual EPA AQI is an estimate of the average concentration over a 24 hour period; see
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index#Computing_the_AQI
in particular the table in the section titled "Computing the AQI"
It uses some past data along with an estimate of future data for a 24 hour period since the pm standards refer to 24 hour averages, not to a current measure. 
The section goes on to state "Real time monitoring data from continuous monitors are typically available as 1-hour averages. However, computation of the AQI for some pollutants requires averaging over multiple hours of data. (For example, calculation of the ozone AQI requires computation of an 8-hour average and computation of the PM2.5 or PM10 AQI requires a 24-hour average.) To accurately reflect the current air quality, the multi-hour average used for the AQI computation should be centered on the current time, but as concentrations of future hours are unknown and are difficult to estimate accurately, EPA uses surrogate concentrations to estimate these multi-hour averages. "
It's an easy error to make.
