Hello [@karishmagvanwari](/profile/karishmagvanwari) 
I'm Rebecca, the education manager for Public Lab. I made some teacher onboarding resources to help classes get started on the website and teachers as moderators came up. Thus far, I've told teachers to email me and I would help them become moderators. But I could definitely see the need for a more streamlined process!
