Great question, it's pretty amazing you were able to shut off the AGC circuit. I had previously imagined that most ofthe pre-data export operations were hardwired or hardcoded in.

Yes it looks like the Debevec algorithm just jumps right over top of the camera functions and wraps it all into one to get from scene illuminance to sensor data. They acknowledge this in their paper.

"Digital cameras, which use charge coupled device (CCD) arrays
to image the scene, are prone to the same difficulties [as film]. Although the
charge collected by a CCD element is proportional to its irradiance,
most digital cameras apply a nonlinear mapping to the CCD outputs
before they are written to the storage medium. This nonlinear map-
ping is used in various ways to mimic the response characteristics of
film, anticipate nonlinear responses in the display device, and often
to convert 12-bit output from the CCDâ€™s analog-to-digital convert-
ers to 8-bit values commonly used to store images. As with film,
the most significant nonlinearity in the response curve is at its sat-
uration point, where any pixel with a radiance above a certain level
is mapped to the same maximum image value."

But the question still remains about how stable is the sensor response curve for our cameras? I guess we can really only know for sure through testing. Test the camera in a variety of situations and compare. Even better would be to test multiple cameras to see the quality control, to test if it could make sense to use one sensor curve and apply it to other people's hardware. That would really reduce the workload required to start doing hdr, although my hunch is it's probably still better to have a customized curve for each individual sensor.
