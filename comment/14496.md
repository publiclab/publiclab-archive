Hi, Georgi - are you asking about Spectral Workbench? We expect JPG data, mostly -- you can read more in [@stoft](/profile/stoft)'s notes about characteristics of the image data in terms of stability, etc.

The resolution is currently 640x480 but we're trying to increase it which shouldn't be too hard: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/issues/104

There is auto-calibration, try calibrating on any given spectrum page, and it makes a best guess with the highest red/blue/green peak spacing ratio. 

We separately record r/g/b data, as the Bayer filter separates, yes. 

Thanks!
