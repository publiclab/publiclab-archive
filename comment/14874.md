I think that makes sense. I didn't mean Beer Lambert would be related to the reagent's affect on the color, but merely that if the reagent reacts linearly with the substance, then Beer Lambert would ensure (all else being equal, as you point out) linearity of transmission of light through the reagent-reacted substance. But controlling all the other variables is not simple!
