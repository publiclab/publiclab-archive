Those were the ones i was referring too. You are correct though that it would be hard work extracting the data manually.

Not only that, but i have no idea how you would take a spectrum and then determine the concentration of a certain chemical...

Is there a way i can get in contact with you about some ideas and questions about a possible raspberry pi spectroscope?
