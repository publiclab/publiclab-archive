Thanks mathew :) I was thinking on those lines only, but I am not able to plan out how should I go about it. I code, so I can try a hack in android, so that it can help others too. I have ordered the kit from Public lab, I am waiting for it. Once I get it I will try building one and keep everyone updated.
