Wow, that's great. Did you use SpectralWorkbench to collect your data about the different samples you used to build your model? It'd be great to see all of them graphed together in a set. 

Could we try to [create a macro for SpectralWorkbench](/wiki/spectral-workbench-api) for this, so people could run it on their phones? I imagine it's quite dependent on calibrating the intensity of the light source, no?
