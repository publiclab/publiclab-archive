Thank you very much Warren.
For smaller screens I will use relative font units which will scale down to fit in.
I'm very concerned about responsiveness (when you have the time, please checkout my website portfolio's responsiveness https://narudesigns.netlify.app). Containers also will be relative sizes rather than fixed.

To accommodate for the tests, (thank you for pointing that out by the way), Will it be okay if I took out the code function to use the time to make up for tests for each of the UI changes? 
If not, I can adjust tasks for these tests to fit in by merging some tasks to fit in a week and making room for the tests.
Once again thank you for the feedback, it is much appreciated!
