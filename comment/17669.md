Oh, hello post.  

Sadly, Barbara is still at it.  

MS Phosphates pollutes the water, as well, which is my subject area. Here is an overflight photo  of the acid phosphate plume ("partially treated" of over 100 million gallons into the Bayou Casotte Ship Channel.

MS Phosphates went bankrupt, and EPA is considering the site for Superfund

The photo shows the plume, but also a diesel spill from Martin Energy that was happening at the same time, so my apologies, but the white color of the plume is somewhat obscured by the brownish color of the diesel spill.  It's kind of exhausting to look at this.
