Thanks David,  
I wish I had some of your manures to spice up my pile. I'm surprised at how hot this pile is without the addition of any N-rich material other than grass. This one might get as hot as any I have measured including when I have added manure or N-rich meals (cottonseed meal, blood meal). I guess healthy grass is a better compost ingredient than I thought.
