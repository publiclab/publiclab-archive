I was able to upload the sketch, but it only changes once per second -- i was hoping for a smoother change, and I'm also not sure it's ever outputting full power, since I've seen it brighter on direct 3.3v power. So I've changed the sketch a little bit to see if the multipliers for the writeValue are off. 

But I can't get it to upload again :-( 

not sure, but the Trinket was in this pulsing red light state when the upload worked, and I can't seem to get it back into that state.
