In today's day and age, CO2 levels are a good indicator of how well indoor air (and exhalations) are being replaced with fresh, outdoor air.

Thank you for your post -- have you done any more work with CO2?

I've noticed that Adafruit sells a board that measures eCO2 which is actually measuring volatile organic compounds. I'm wondering if this also rises and falls with human exhalations in the same way, or if it can be confused with other environmental factors.

Will need to research further.
