This seems to be related to an old issue [posted at Github](https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin/issues/5). Applying a lut to a float NDVI image from the photomonitoring plugin does not produce the same color NDVI image output by the plugin. The NDVI produced by applying a lut to a floating point NDVI image is the same as the NDVI image produced by the plugin when scaling from 0 to 1 is selected (instead of scaling from -1 to 1). At one point I figured out a workaround but I can't remember what I did.
