For what it's worth: I just added a header to the board to break out pins A0,A1,A2,D3, D5, D6, SDA, SCL (the I2C bus), VCC, and GND -- so that folks could wire the device up to other things / boards / an LCD / etc ... updated the board layout here: https://github.com/Pioneer-Valley-Open-Science/thermal-flashlight

Note: my layout can certainly be improved! But at this point:

- It definitely fits inside the 2"x 2" area that seems to be the cheapest PCB manufacturing option;
- Ray sells his boards for $22 each (without the IR sensor), for a profit -- so that's encouraging re: the cost of producing these ...
- I kept the buzzer on the board, b/c a piezo buzzer 'geiger counter' that would speed up with temperature would be kinda awesome ...
