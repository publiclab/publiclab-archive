For calibration I think the most important factor with white  balance is that you keep it the same for an entire mission. An advantage to using the white balance methods that Chris Fastie uses is that you can make decent NDVI images even if you are not able to do more rigorous calibration. 

I do not have spectral response data for the Mobius so perhaps the best alternative is to look at response curves from other cameras to get a rough idea. Here is a site with a few curves and you will see that they are all quite similar: https://www.maxmax.com/spectral_response.htm
