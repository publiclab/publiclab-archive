I just removed the IR blocking filter from a black Canon A1300. Virtually the same procedure applied as with the A1200 mentioned above. I didn't put in the developed film though, because I'm not too happy about the amount of visible light that still gets through that. I think I'll glue a filter mount ring for astronomical oculars onto the front of the lens housing so I can screw on all kinds of filters. I'll get me a very deep red glass filter for NIR.
I'm going to mount the black A1300 on a bar beside a silver unmodified A1300 so I can take two shots at the same time. Should be fun :-)
