the power issues are going to be tough. Most power control chips do tricky high-speed things to push out a DC signal and the voltage isn't very clean.  A dedicated battery for the sensor will give a nicer DC signal.  my suggestion is to research audio equipment.  Somewhere there is an audiophile electronics nerd with a portable headphone amp design that will give you the clean, consistent AC power signal that you're looking for. 

I'm also going to re-iterate my earlier suggestion of using a 1/8" mini-jack for conductivity, it'll give you 2mm spacing.
