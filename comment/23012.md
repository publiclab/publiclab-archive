Hi [@MarcioPamplona](/profile/MarcioPamplona), Step one is to figure out where the absorbance shows up.  By that I mean the wavelength that you need to detect.  Googling "wood moisture nir" gave a link to an article in the Journal of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (2000, vol 8, p183).  While I could not get the text of the article, the abstract indicates that bands are observed around 1450 and 1930 nm.  Question 2 is: what kind of detector will you need to observe this wavelength? Googling "near infrared detectors" got this: https://www.noao.edu/meetings/gdw/files/Joyce_IR.pdf.  The pdf seems to suggest that silicon based ccd's are useful to 1000 nm and above that, you need a specialized detector (ie, silicon based ccds like those in webcams will not work).  ThorLabs will sell you a detector that should work for about $200 (https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=6479).  That will give you one pixel.  Of course, you will still need to build something that will separate wavelengths for you and allow you to make background and reference measurements.  You can probably use some kind of chopper with filters to do this, so I think you can get away without a grating.  Still, this is a pretty daunting project.  Good luck. Jack
