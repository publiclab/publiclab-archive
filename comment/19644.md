Thanks! Interesting that 580nm plus or minus  x nm could be a type of spectral anchor.   I am wondering if an opencv  technique could be used to calibrate a spectrum instead of the typical calibration that is done  for  an image?   
For example: https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/calib3d/camera_calibration/camera_calibration.html

(Also, nice ardunio work BTW)
