[@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) I'd love to pick your brain about the technologies. I am familiar with the general trends, but only bc I've read about them, have worked with labs that have used them, and have spoken with an analytical chemist. AKA, I've never actually used them. 

BUT I'd like to know them better. I'm also exploring what a low-cost / DIY testing kit might look like that doesn't involve fancy lab-based equipment like ICP-MS, AA, XRF (though that's more portable), and others... 

I've thrown together this spreadsheet that has tech on the Y axis and sample-types + variables on the X. Do you mind taking a look at this and providing reactions? Certainly feel free to jump into that file, but even comments on whether I have the file structured appropriate and if I have all the main technologies listed would be helpful. I'll be chipping away at this over time...

And for a bit more background... 
Here's a writeup of this effort I'm working on: https://publiclab.org/wiki/the-lead-data-collaborative-overview
