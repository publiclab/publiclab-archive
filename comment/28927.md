Yes, the instruments are the same (4-gas meter from RKI)  and are a couple digits away from each other; they were purchased as a group. We keep them calibrated and perform a mini calibration every morning before use.

I had this same result early AM yesterday. A curious finding and am wondering if it is equipment related or if some known phenomena is at work.
