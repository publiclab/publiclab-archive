if you read my research note,it was quite specific about the model of the spectrometer used in the plab spec 3 model as supplied I have no idea where the one you used came from the spec 3 one&nbsp; referred to may be one from a laptop, don't know on that one the ir cut filter is on the back of the lens which I scored using a sharp metal pick. the procedure is quite detailed in my note with pictures. I have built many and postedthe spectra results on spectral work bench. one thing you should realize is that the spectral work bench does not use the ull native resolution of the camerathat it is capable of.. btw, what model camera are you using?
any other questions?

I tried taking the glass off the front of the CCD, but that ruined it.
