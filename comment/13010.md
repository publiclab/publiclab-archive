Fantastic -- thanks [@SteveHicks](/profile/SteveHicks)!

Ah, I see the source of my confusion.  I was reading the explanation here:

https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AttachInterrupt

Which indicates that interrupts on the 328 can only be done with pin 2 and 3 ...

But digging in further, I see that there are two types of interrupts -- "external" and "change".  The "external" interrupts allow one to specify which particular signal will trigger the interrupt -- a rising voltage, a falling voltage, a specific threshold ... whereas "change" interrupts simply trigger if there is any change on the pin at all.  Apparently there are only two "external" interrupts available on the 328 -- on pins 2 and 3 ... but nearly any digital pin can be used as a "change" interrupt.  

So, it sounds like we could use a "change" interrupt to wake up the device?  But it also sounds like it's a bit more complicated ... apparently pins are grouped for this feature, and one has to do some work to figure out which pin changed ...
