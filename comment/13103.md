Kits is going to start shipping the pvc length as part of this kit, but will recommend using it without any internal padding (to compensate for the pole's taper). And I'll just explain it using the regular construction, not the double wall variation. Better to retain 

Just spreading the force out over more of the pole area does increase the strength, and allows a bit more height as a result. Also, it makes the mounting more easily communicated, as you're not having to explain where to mount it, just mount it to the pipe, and slide pipe over [#2](/n/2) section of pole until it stops.
