I tried using the beta capture interface in Chrome on my Galaxy S3. I ran into a couple issues that prevented me from taking a spectrum. The main issue is that it samples from the front facing camera and I can't figure out how to switch to the rear camera. This may be a WebRTC limitation in Android Chrome so I'm not sure if anything can be done about it. Also, it would be nice to be able to rotate the sampling row somehow on the initial screen. It's a really cool tool, and I'd really like to be able to use on my phone some day.
It seems like building an Android app to do the video capture would solve a couple problems. It would avoid the WebRTC bugs, and it might give you some control over the camera's focus. I've found that when I use the camera app to photograph spectra I have to fight against autofocus or accidental re-focuses triggered by screen taps.
