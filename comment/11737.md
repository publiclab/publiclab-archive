I'm not sure how you want to build an IR spectrometer using this method. I highly suggest reading the general description on infrared spectroscopy on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy). Although I'm sure that you can pull this off if you have solid engineering background, (FT)IR spectrometer builds are generally outside the budget of most citizen scientists. Although there are people who manage to pull off some truly complex builds, see the DIY [Raman spectrometer](https://hackaday.io/project/1279-ramanpi-raman-spectrometer), but these builds skirt the edges of a tech startup rather than a weekend project.
