They've shipped! 

Anyhow, I need to ask Leif where to connect the Melexis; on an Arduino Uno you can use the Analog 4 and 5 (as shown here: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/12-12-2011/circuit-diagram-simple-thermal-flashlight)

From this page: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardLeonardo it looks like the 4th and 5th pin clockwise from the dot are A4 and A5 (as in the below image, marked with two magenta arrows); on the Visualight, these aren't used and might be quite hard to get to. But maybe Leif knows something we don't -- maybe on the Leonardo's chip, i2c (the protocol to connect to the Melexis temperature sensor) is assigned to different pins.
