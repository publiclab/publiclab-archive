Amazing! Fantastic!

Good questions too -- iFrames are supposed to work, but I will do a bit of debugging and see what's broken.

.svg sharing... not sure. I think the uploader doesn't recognize them. Do most browsers render them same as .png or .jpg? I can just add .svg to the uploader formats list then.
