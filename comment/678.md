Thanks Randy.  You must be right about the relay. Here is the circuit for the MK111 timer:
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/52862669@N08/7137417735/" title="MK111schem by Chris Fastie, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8022/7137417735_ebd332230d.jpg" width="500" height="246" alt="MK111schem"></a>

The <a href="http://www.velleman.eu/downloads/0/minikits/manuals/manual_mk111.pdf">assembly manual (pdf)</a> has some more specs for the components as well as this schematic again. It would be great to trigger the camera without the relay.

I tested some more batteries.  The timer runs (the LED flashes) but the relay does not switch with six or seven eneloop AAA (7.2v or 8.4v). It takes eight eneloop AAA (9.6v) to get the relay to operate.  I am endurance testing right now (not me, the timer and two cameras).

The CR123A looks like a good solution.  About $2 apiece, and four of them should do the job.  Much heavier than I would like, especially since the camera might need separate power, but maybe the best we will do with the MK111.

Thanks for your help.
