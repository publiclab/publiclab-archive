Sure; they are just different file types (content). Initially, for testing, there could be just one "default" selection with buried data as a proof-of-concept and which allows the user to validate that any other cal file is producing at least reasonable results. It's a stepped process: a) unspecified error limits (now), b) ~10% error (Solux), c)  lower error (other)? .... with the final error budget yet to be determined.
