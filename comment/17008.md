Part of the exciting part of this test suite (that we posted a request for here: https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/06-21-2017/test-images-for-multispectral-image-processing) is that we shouldn't have to trust coders to know for sure -- we can ensure these things empirically. 

[@ananyo2012](/profile/ananyo2012) - I think Chris would like to be able to drag images into comments -- the function already exists in https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/master/app/views/comments/_form.html.erb -- do you think you two could open an issue on github to use that form in the Question comments area? 

It'd replace this section here: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/master/app/views/questions/_comment.html.erb#L22
