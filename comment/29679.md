journal entry 1: You walk down the street and see a water bottle on the ground. You in fact see multiple. An everyday item, which is used all the time by us. It is made in a recycling factory that recycles used plastic and makes them into water bottles.. It was made to store water for people to drink. And it was on the ground because someone threw it there being lazy.
