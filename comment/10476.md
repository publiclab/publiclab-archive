The sensor size is not definitive. The Infragram webcam is more sensitive than the SYBA, but has the same sensor size as the SANM camera.  Its also a pain in the butt to get the filters out of.

Another thing to look out for in camera sourcing is UVC implementation.  I've got a stack of cameras here that work on windows and nothing else.
