We usually just record the data right after our 24-hour sampling, but the Tech team at UWEC is helping us figure out how to retrieve our continuous data from the Dusttrak 1 and Dylos. The Dusttrak only has an ethernet cable, so we plan to get an ethernet to USB cable and for the Dylos, I think it's a 9 pin serial port.
