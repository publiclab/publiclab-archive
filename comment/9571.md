We werent sure at first but the color differences between the phrag and other grasses is pretty distinct.  I uploaded a second annotated image.  And we actually used photomerge on photoshop to stitch these photos together.  True it doesnt have a map layer behind it but was much easier to get a better merge.  Any strong opinions on this?  Also, we're not too sure what the next steps with the project should be.  The park is huge and it would take a long time to map everything...
