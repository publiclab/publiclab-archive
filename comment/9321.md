Anish - just thinking of how you'll integrate with Vidun; those values (or rather lat1,lon1,lat2,lon2) will be part of the constructor, like `DistortableImage.new(1,2,3,4)` or something.

I'll try it on iOS 6... what iOS are you using? This seems to indicate that matrix3d is supported: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17870192/how-to-use-3d-matrix-to-create-suck-effect-in-css but maybe it requires a -webkit prefix?
