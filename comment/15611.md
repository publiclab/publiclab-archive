Thanks Jeff; understood. I'm presently working on a higher resolution P-4 spectrometers (including monochrome) so might find a spot for comparison testing. However, for a given slit width, I don't believe the effect of attenuation would be as significant as the effect of distortion on resolution -- which I think may account for the 'shape' and width of sharp peaks I'd see with the film-slit versions I built. My theory is that at wavelength dimensions, some diffraction may occur from the 'fuzzy' edges of the film's exposure pattern (these are visible with a loupe magnifier). However, I do agree that some rigorous comparative observations are needed to support, explain or dismiss the potential issues. Meanwhile, it does seems clear that this method can provide an accurate open-air slit which is the best I can build w/o machining parts.
