What do you think of the ones that are transparent on all four sides?  That way the cuvettes can be used for trans, abs, flores, or turbidity.

There are cuvettes made of styrene and abs.  Good to what? 280 nm?  These are relatively cheap.  Best are quartz, but boy are they expensive!!!  Any other options as far as plastics? I'd love a cheap one good to 200 nm, but haven't seen it yet.
