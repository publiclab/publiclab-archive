Hello cfastie,

Thank you very much for your answer.

I bought this pack of filters
https://store.publiclab.org/collections/diy-infrared-photography/products/infragram-diy-filter-pack

and I selected the red filter.

When taking the photographs did not have any adjustment, calibration either, that must be the problem.

I must calibrate the camera to take more pictures.

One question, it is important the presence of sunlight?

regards
