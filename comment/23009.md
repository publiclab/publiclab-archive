There are a number of publications in this area because of the increased use of renewables (e.g. wood) for heating and the increased fire danger that is resulting from climate change.  A couple of  quick points from the background research I did on moisture content of wood (note that this relates to woods and not to grains or grasses). 

- it is necessary to penetrate the surface of the wood by1/5 to 1/4 of it's thickness to get a good measurement of moisture content. The moisture content can vary quickly and dramatically from the surface through a section of wood. 
- different woods will provide different surface and subsurface moisture content readings

The most common techniques to use are either weight or conductivity. 

From personal experience with security systems, measuring the surface characteristics to understand the moisture content presents some technical issues. For example, under common environmental conditions chain link fence can be found to have a high moisture content. 

It is certainly a challenging and interesting question.
