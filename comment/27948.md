If the offer still stands, that would be great! The draft permit for renewal is not available yet. We were told it would be up for public comment soon, but it is already five years pass expiration. All we have right now is the current permit (attached).

There is a new construction permit that can be found online at https://opc.deq.state.ms.us/ensearchonline/ai-info/2299. 

I found this guide to be an excellent resource for reviewing permits. It doesn't help as if you don't understand the science (which is where we very much need support) but if gives a good idea about what should be included in every permit. http://www.cacwny.org/docs/Title%20V%20-%20The%20proof%20is%20in%20the%20permit.PDF
