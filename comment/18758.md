Hi there, what a great project! 
I have a question, in a certain way related to your article.
Would it be possible to connect or adapt your work to an existing "stereo microscope", quite old and I have been thinking to somehow connect to a camera or even a PC?
I use it for particle size and shape analysis of sandstone, beach sand, soil fractions passing 60 microns. So far I have tried an application "Magnifier" which is ok to get some images at to about 20 microns. Anything smaller is not that clear.
