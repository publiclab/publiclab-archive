I am planning on buying a kit to see if it will help me with my bees during the winter.  Bees cluster for warmth and the ability to see the heat signature from outside the hive will provide many benefits. I hope to check and track cluster size and movement without opening the hive.  I also have a garden, so learning how to check plant health is interesting as well.
