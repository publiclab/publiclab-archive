This is a really great experiment.

It looks like the distortion is a squeezed distortion, where the x-axis is shrunk around a point. That seems more like the result of a physical difference in how the diffraction grating was squeezed. You might want to repeat the experiment two more times and plot all six spectra together (three lines with one color, three lines with another color). That'll give you some visual idea of how much physically manipulating the grating distorts the reading.

The amplitudes would be the most likely way in which the dye would distort the results. You can see that the amplitudes in the shorter wavelengths are more diminished with no dye in the low wavelengths. I have no idea why the dye would cause an increase in low-wavelength diffraction. If anything, I would expect the purple dye to absorb, and thus diminish the amplitude of, the very low and very high wavelengths (red and blue).
