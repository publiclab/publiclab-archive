Thanks for the input, Dave. 

I had another idea -- we've talked about asking for things **after** someone presses publish (like, for example, tagging) to reduce the upfront requirements and present a simpler form. 

Some of these could go at the head or foot of the note itself, once published. Like "now, invite others to reproduce your work -- be sure youve provided a materials list and instructions" or "add this to a series of recent research" or "mark this as an open challenge" or whatever.
