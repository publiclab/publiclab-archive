Hi, I see in the Wiki that you are planning to use Rhuus or a similar system to mark the sites.  depending on the timeline of these activities, you may be able to use Mapknitter's annotation functions, [as will have them re-written by end of summer](/notes/justinmanley/03-18-2014/mapknitter-annotations-using-fabric-js-gsoc-2014-proposal).  It would be great to have a test case community to work on the annotations interface with.
