I've been thinking along similar lines to Chris, and would also be very interested to learn more about how the kind of intensity-less matching he demonstrates compares to a methodology that accounts for absolute intensity.

I think this is something discussed on the list a lot without reaching a resolution, and the neon example is a good place to start!
