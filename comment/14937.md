However ....... 1) the slit-based PLab design does not provide the optical characteristics of field of view like the lens on a camera (and I'm not aware of any analogous measure for the spectrometer) so with scattered reflected light the "detection aperture angle" is unknown and 2) the dynamic range of a web-cam based spectrometer is quite small relative to the potential light level dynamics of outdoors. A major factor could easily be having either very low, noisy signals or heavily clipped ones -- both unusable. A first step might be a simple experiment to just obtain a reflected light outdoor spectra from a few stories up, looking down, under "drone" light conditions. Outside lighting can cover many orders of magnitude but the PLab device's range is (presently) limited to adding attenuation. But, maybe, a single "setup attenuation" for each survey could be sufficient .? .. would be an interesting experiment.

It is a new application concept for a DIY spectrometer so could be worth investigating the basics to find the relative limits.
