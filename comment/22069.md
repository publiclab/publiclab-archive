[@warren](/profile/warren) [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996) for https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/2497 .. the notifications api .. are we trying to make one like fb has.. with a list of notifications all to be displayed .. or the one like gitter .. that gives a pop-up ? if we decide to make one like fb we wouldn't have to worry about multiple tab issue..
