here's a visualization of research findings about lead contamination (soil or water-borne) concentrations in different plant parts. Original research from Finster, M. E., Gray, K. A. & Binns, H. J. (2004) Lead levels of edibles grown in contaminated residential soils: a field survey. Science of The Total Environment, 320, 245-257.

Also, b/c contaminants often associated with zinc, some researchers suggest using cheap soil tests for minerals to assess zinc levels, and if those are high, then try to get lead and other heavy metals tested for. That's from Mitchell, R. G., Spliethoff, H. M., Ribaudo, L. N., Lopp, D. M., Shayler, H. A., Marquez-Bravo, L. G., Lambert, V. T., Ferenz, G. S., Russell-Anelli, J. M., Stone, E. B., et al. (2014) Lead (Pb) and other metals in New York City community garden soils: factors influencing contaminant distributions. Environmental Pollution, 187, 162-169
