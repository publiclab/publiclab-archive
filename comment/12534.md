I appreciate your thoughts Chris and Ned.

For interest, I obtained a much better result (i.e. better registration) when I cropped the RGB and NIR mosaics first, and then ran them through the NDVI processing. Perhaps the ragged edges gave the affine transformation in bUnwarpJ too much to think about - it did a better job once the mosaics were cropped.
