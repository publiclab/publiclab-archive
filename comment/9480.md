Wow, very cool. Does the Arduino monitor it via a light sensor? 

I also want to test the new callouts feature: [@mathew](/profile/mathew), did you get a notification for this comment? This is a design for a crazy-low-cost sensor built only around the 555 instead of a microprocessor. Related to the "sensor cricket" idea of graphing via light or sound.
