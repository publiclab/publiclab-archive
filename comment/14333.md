I have ben conducted a literaturere view of this subject when I encountered this source article, in which I am now responding. The two listed below are quite instructive. MBTElectronics has an embedded link to a free PDF of the studied DIY SSS (Side Scan Sonar) unit. 

YES, a DIY SSS unit you can build yourself. This article looks pre-Duino, as it currently is in Rev 1, post initial issue it has a current publishing of 2010, but as an Electronics Archeologist i can honestly assess the original design as pre-Atari. Most of the parts ( Ihavent researched them all) can still be found, and engineering substitutuions are available for anything shown. A duino would EASILY pass for the rolling graph (sooooo Hipster retro, I want one in my refrigerator to tell me how many times I open my fridge for illicit snacking after the dorm ma'am closes down the soup kitchen line.) Anyway..........., the pdf has a fully functioning diy SideScanSonar that ole Doc Edgerton would gladly sit in the middle of the Mystic River with.
