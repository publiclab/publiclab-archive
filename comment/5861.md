Greetings, can you tell me the brand and technical specifications of the laser you used in this experiment ? I would definitly like to expand on this idea. I understand some methods involve using UV lasers / LEDs in order to detect hydrocarbons and that red lasers also create fluorescence in certain samples. 

Also, Do you know of any charts or reference indicating what substance emits what color spectrum using which type of laser ? If not, it seems to me such a chart would be a great project to work on and share.

Thanks !
