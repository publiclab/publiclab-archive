I was Just looking for this publication online. Thanks for posting Scott. Any ideas where we can get the full one?

[@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) you should check out LEAN's publication when you get a moment (or the piece of it that's hear anyway). It's Awesome! I can't find the full publication online, but they have a beautiful printed form out I'll try to get my hands on. 

 I think it would be good to put together a wiki page of these types of resources that are available. I was just on a call about the Toxics Action Center's new publication on "Is a health study the answer for your community? A guide for making informed decisions." http://www.bu.edu/sph/files/2015/03/HSG_5-14-2015_nocover.pdf Also really interesting.
