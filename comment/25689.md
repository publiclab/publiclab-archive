I noticed that the yellow/orange rope we're using sheds quite a bit, if it's helpful to know. I guess I'd assume a finer rope (pea cord maybe?) would shed less but I really don't know. This isn't a great photo but lots of small particles like this fall off while I'm packing the kits, which I didn't like, so I'd love to upgrade to another type of rope if possible:

Note: wearing black jeans is really good for finding microplastics. 

Here's a pic of the rope in a coil:
