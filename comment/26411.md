mchao2, 
All that is presented here is a multicolor image and that it was taken by an [aerial] drone. The actual type of image is not provided; is it an NVDI? Is there a conventional visible light [only] image available for comparison? Why do you title the image "Sidewalk & Stones"? 

Is the purpose of the image to validate your technique of image acquisition? Is the intent of the image to demonstrate a non-trivial environmental abnormality or aberrancy, or do you present it for its artistic value?  

If others believe that I'm not seeing other image data or captions you provided, I would need to be so advised, as I am relatively new to this website.
