For 360Â° kite panoramas, I let ICE analyze the photos and do the stitching. If the stitching works, ICE usually selects the "spherical" projection to display the result. That projection is usually what you want for a (mostly) spherical panorama. Then you can straighten the horizon (a key step) and center the panorama by dragging it around before you export it. Skip the cropping step if you want to display it in a spherical viewer.
