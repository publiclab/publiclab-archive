[@danbeavers](/profile/danbeavers)- see todays dive report for details but basically I found the glider floats on the surface until I add enough weight to make it 2 3/4 ibs.  The target range range is apparently somewhere between 2.5 and 2.75ibs.

[@lperovich](/profile/lperovich)-  I was planning to use a waterproof DS18B20 temp sensor from Adafruit- http://www.adafruit.com/products/381 simply because I already have one.  However, the product description is indeed accurate in that the Dallas Temperature Library tends to add a lot of complex code that can be a major pain...  I still have a ways to go before I have a workable design for the node cone and sensor pod housing, but I'm thinking of making it in two parts, with the bottom shaped to mount either the waterproof sensor pod or the waterproof case for the Mobius Action Cam that I just recieved from Joovu.com- https://www.joovuu.com/gb/cases/103-mobius-waterproof-case.html.
