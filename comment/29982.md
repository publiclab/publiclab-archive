World Population- 7,939,829,800 

We will reach 8 billion in a year or two. 
In the videos that we watched, I learned the estimation of the Earth's population was a billon over the actual population of the Earth today. In the second video it shoed that it took 125 years for the population to leap form 1 billion to 2 billion. Our population increases by 1 billion every 15 years or so.
