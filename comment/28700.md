Thanks [@ruthwaiganjo](/profile/ruthwaiganjo), Yes i had problems with the research note, if I work on it for long hours it hangs and I couldn't publish it, [@jywarren](/profile/jywarren) opened an issue for it here :https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/9569.
I had to take screenshots and upload those for me to publish. Thanks for the input and suggestions. Since the Outreachy deadline has passed, is it ok to modify this project here so as to include your suggestions?
