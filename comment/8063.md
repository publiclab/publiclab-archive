Right now we've been testing photosynthesis measurements on the MultispeQ against known devices in our lab.  However, most things in our lab aren't 'standard' devices - we have a lot of specialty machines which are very accurate but not cheap.  So we'd love to get beta testers to do some direct comparison against commercial handheld fluorometers and SPAD meters - many beta testers are plant science folks who have these tools on hand.  If we don't get a lot of help there, then we'll do it ourselves here, but we want to try to focus on efforts on developing the equipment and website if possible and we have limited cycles.

It's a great question about how to compare better resolution... The way we've done it now is to look at the raw data points and measure the noise (imagine for example 300 data points with a mean of 900 and a standard deviation of 50 where ideally they should all be the same).  Many devices (like the LiCOR 6400, or benchtop flourometers like we have in the lab) do output the raw data so in those cases we can simply compare how noisy their signal is versus ours.   A different device or technique which does not output the raw data but instead just outputs the finished calculated value we won't be able to compare directly noise levels, but we could take several measurements on the same sample and see how much noise there is on the finished calculated value.
