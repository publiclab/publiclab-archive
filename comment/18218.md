Nice graphics. Yes, white LEDs are not broad spectrum.
If it's of any help, I set (Matlab code) the ELP camera to: Manual Exposure, Exposure=-3 (-14:-1 range), Gain=0 (0:100), Gamma=100 (70:500), Brightness=0 (-64:+64), White Balance=Manual, WB=6500 (2800:6500), Contrast=32 (0:64), Sharpness=2 (0:6), FrameRate=12 (12.000), Brightness=64 (1:128).
