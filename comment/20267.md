Actually  it's an entity type. "Entities" are self-defined things (people, organizations, projects, etc) while "facets" aren't self-descriptive but rather describe something (concepts, workflows, tutorials, etc). 

Endpoints can be found here: http://recola.org/knowledge-api/

Let me know if you try to access stuff, have ideas for improvements, etc. 

You'd be the first person to try to use our API so very excited about the prospect!
