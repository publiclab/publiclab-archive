One place to start might be monitoring the levels of [particulate matter](https://publiclab.org/wiki/pm) in your home. You could compare sensors across rooms to see if there are any hot-spots for dust. You could do this with something like the [#purple-air](/tag/purple-air) sensors that many folks on this site use. [This resource can help you to compare different inexpensive air-quality monitors. ](https://publiclab.org/notes/jiteovien/08-29-2018/how-to-evaluate-low-cost-air-quality-sensors)

If you're concerned about Lead, there area many at-home tests that you can get at your local hardware store. [@read_holman](/profile/read_holman) [put together this great resource on testing for lead in your home. ](https://publiclab.org/notes/read_holman/04-11-2019/how-to-test-for-lead-in-your-environment)

Another thing you can investigate is whether this dust is originating inside of your home or may be something coming in from outside. Our tool [Leaflet Environmental Layers](https://publiclab.org/search?q=leaflet%20environmental%20layers) can help you to look and see what types of environmental monitoring is happening near your home that may seem relevant. From [PublicLab.org/map](www.publiclab.org/map) you can use the menu in the upper right had corner to view local environmental data.
