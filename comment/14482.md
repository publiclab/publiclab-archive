Yes, procedurally (for the form) reminders are generally easy. However, I'd suggest (or remind ;-) ) that such action items would mandate that each have some web functionality to back it up. For instance, 'add to series of research' would 1) still require the submit process and 2) there would have to be some form of 'note series linking' in existence.

Help with tagging is fine, but it is frequently either ignored or abused rather badly by some so I'd suggest 1) the tagging process needs to be redesigned and 2) if tagging is to be used at all, existing note tags need to be cleaned up. I realize this is a bit drastic, but maybe [#2](/n/2) could be initially automated a bit -- do an automated search of all existing notes and compare words used in the body of the note to words in the tags and remove all but the top 5 matching tags. For notes with no tags, the same process could add 3 tags based on the same word predominance within the body text.
