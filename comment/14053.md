I meanwhile tried to "straighten up" things a bit in the setup (although the velcro tape is not very helpful for small adjustments - perhaps one could invent a "cardboard slide in system" for the tray build-up?) and got a continuuos spectrum now, but still the yellows and reds are missing completely. I took this image of another (smaller) IKEA lamp. I also got the impression that the system needs loads of light to work properly. This lets me think that the way of light within my device still is a little bit blocked by something.
