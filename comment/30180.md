Hey! [@jywarren](/profile/jywarren) , thanks a lot for ur feedback.

For the hashtag idea, it will be useful to aggregate similar kinds of authors and even during the spamming of authors of the same kind of topic. The user can get to know whether the author is a first-timer or regular, if he/she is a regular author then automatically one hashtag will be granted to the author stating the credibility of the respective author. Apart from it, if the author has put the place name or country name with a hashtag it will be easier for the user to segregate the maps according to the specific region using the search bar.



It is important to set up proper notification systems as a site admin when it comes to banning authors on the website.
Emails will be sent to both administrators and authors whose content was banned. The email will mention that the author has been banned and is undergoing a review period in which they may not upload any new content. After the review time is complete, members will receive a follow-up notification from the administrator stating whether or not their account was unbanned.



Regarding the UI which I have designed from scratch using figma and it can be integrated with Bootstrap UI library or any other SC.
