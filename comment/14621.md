[@stoft](/profile/stoft) thank you very much for the clarification and suggestions. 

About 1) I am looking to use cars mirror, that should be front-surface mirrors. 

In order to avoid unwanted reflections I painted the wall of the chamber with black tempera color. Trying before and after you actually see a lot of difference: indeed without painting lot of noise was collected in the camera.

Also reducing the number of mirrors is a very good suggestion and I think is indeed possible keeping fixed the 7x7cm box. I will try with 2 as you said.
