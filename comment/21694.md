 I'm not entirely sure what you mean by manually sorting them, but I think the problem there would be that some tags belong to both categories.  There are two pieces to the tag graph, the calculation of tag co-occurrence (and subsequent removal of co-occurrences below a given threshold), and then the community detection.  You might be able to get away with just doing co-occurrences.  That code would be easy enough to transfer from python to ruby to run every so often.  Now that there is a web dev (hi by the way!) you could also just implement the javascript version of [tagoverflow](https://github.com/stared/tagoverflow#tagoverflow) and replace the data.
