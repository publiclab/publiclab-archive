Oh, sweet, thanks for the styrene link. MozillaOS should work fine -- however the web based version is fully functional (i'm adding offline caching so it can be used even without a web connection) and i expect as browsers catch up to Opera in implementing WebRTC features, it'll work with stock browsers as well. Luckily that means that when MozillaOS is ready, it should "just work" but we don't have to wait for it to get started.
