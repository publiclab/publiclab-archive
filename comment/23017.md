An quick update: The TDS sensor from DFRobots performs as describes. Very easy to connect to the MiniPearl logger. In general, it collects a voltage drop and converts that to a TDS value in PPM.  As noted by DFRobots, conversion to conductivity is a simple scaling (i.e. multiply by 2).  I got the TDS sensor working on the Mini Pearl Logger (with a hint from [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)) and the TDS values match reasonably to the values obtained via a TDS pen I had laying around but never used. Interestingly the TDS pen also converts to a Conductivity value by simply multiplying by 2.  Instructions and code for calibrating the TDS sensor are provided by DFRobots.   I briefly got the DS18B20 temperature probe and the TDS sensor sorta working together on the Mini-Pearl Logger  (some significant power saving timing issues still needed to be worked out). Then I fried something and now cannot access the microUSB. I'm going to work understanding the TDS sampling code before I jump back into the hardware.
