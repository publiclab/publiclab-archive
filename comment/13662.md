Hi, Dave - i noticed that https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/71409 has a `linearCalibration` operation - I think by mistake, as it's not a CFL. I removed it (i'm an admin, so i'm able to) but can add it back in if it was intentional?

Also, I was just wondering, your black line in your most recent image does not seem to be an average of the channels, and does not match the data I see before attempting to apply the correction:

I'm working on getting the correction working now, but just wanted to check on this so that I see a clear before/after state that matches yours. Thanks!
