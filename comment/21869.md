 [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) ,  Thanks for the reply.  There might exist different view angle, about the challenge and ways to tackle the problem.  Your answer is right, mentioning the standard process for chemical analysis, which certainly gives more precision about composition and dilution of contaminants. At the other side, lets think about a one step process,  simply by measuring a water sample with precision and loading its data into a digital infra. Two ideas here: 

What:   
. If we add a mixture of chelants or other reagents prepared to match the known fingerprint of the contaminants, so that its spectral lines get visible in the VIS/UV spectrophotometer image? 
      
. If we use more advanced algorithms for detection of emission & absorbance lines of chemical elements based on a database, much in a ways as practiced in astrochmeistry? Machine learning might also be helpful to raise precision.  

Any thoughts on this how to improve the detection by use of contaminants in a simple IoT oriented process?
