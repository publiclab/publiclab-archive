[@flatCat](/profile/flatCat) that sounds like a good evolution of a project, and glad you were inspired to share it ("Do things and tell people!" is one of our motto here). So far I got great response sharing your design, people are actually really excited about scientific research even when / despite that they don't know where to start! :)

[@liz](/profile/liz) it's quite possible, though can make sure next time you are in town! :) The two guys I heard of, and looks like we have a lot of common friends, but probably not yet!
