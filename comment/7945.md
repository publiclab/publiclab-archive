the reason for the fast fallof at 600+ nm is IR filter on the CCD/CMOS chip of the camera. I am currently working on similar problem. I need to calibrate the spectrometer's sensitivity to different wavelengths for  measurement of grow-lights. The problem with red and far red light cannot be solved by simple calculation, since the signal is either not present in this area or is deeply buried in noise. One option would be to use IR enabled security camera, but these are rather pricey for my pocket.  For material analysis the different response of the sensor can be overcomed by covering 1/2 half of the entrance slit with your sample cuvette and the other half with reference cuvette. In this way you can measure relative absorbance at each wavelenght directly from one image. You only have to pay attention not to over saturate the sensor.
