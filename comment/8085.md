Cool, I just added a screw terminal footprint, and a footprint for a resistor -- so now it's also a thermal fishing bob device (the board layout in my earlier comment should reflect that now, as it links to the github repo).  We could use the [Adafruit 10K thermistor](http://www.adafruit.com/products/372) (which would mean placing a 10K resistor), or we can e.g. use of these [3K thermistors](http://www.redfishsensors.com/index.php/temperature/redfish-thermistors/rsbr-3k-teflon.html) (requiring a 3K resistor), which are approx $2 when 100 of them are ordered. But we can always decide not to populate the screw terminal or thermistor, if just distributing it as a thermal flashlight.

I'll need to look into whether it might make more sense to use the Leonardo (32u4) chip, instead of the Atmega 328p.  Ray is using a cool custom bootloader he wrote himself to allow for USB connectivity to the 328p without any extra silicon; I'll ask him whether that's a good idea in our case ...
