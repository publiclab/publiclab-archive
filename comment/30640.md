     Deposition is the geological process in which sediments, soil and rocks are added to a landform or landmass. Wind, ice, water, and gravity transport previously weathered surface material, which, at the loss of enough kinetic energy in the fluid, is deposited, building up layers of sediment. 
Sediment can be transported as pebbles, sand, and mud, or as salts dissolved in water. Sublimation is the conversion between the solid and the gaseous phases of matter, with no intermediate liquid stage. For those of us interested in the water cycle, sublimation is most often used to describe the process of snow and ice changing into water vapor in the air without first melting into water. 
      The difference between exothermic and endothermic is, endothermic is accompanied by or requiring the absorption of heat. While exothermic is accompanied by the release of heat.  Chemical reactions that release energy are called exothermic. In exothermic reactions, more energy is released when the bonds are formed in the products than is used to break the bonds in the reactants. Chemical reactions that absorb (or use) energy are called endothermic.
