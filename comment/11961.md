Tangled lines can be frustrating.  I think I'd recommend putting the two picavet attachments a bit further apart on the kite line (one arm span works for me), and maybe the whole array a bit further from the kite.  The first gives more rotational stability.  The second gets your kite into more stable air before attaching the camera and makes them a little less dynamically linked.  

Somehow I eventually got better at avoiding the tangle, but I think it comes from getting burned and getting more careful.  For me, it's a little easier with carabiners as attachments.  I'll drape the lines over the back of my neck and attach the carabiners back to the camera cradle for transport.  I do something similar over the headrest in my car.  I'm not above using a bungee or a twist tie to help in the middle, but above all, always try to avoid slack ;)  

Good look keeping everything connected.  I think I'm struggling with an intermittent short on my current arduino auto-KAP rig :(    Wish they were bullet proof.
