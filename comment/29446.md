Hi all- 
Update for the week, I am currently trying to program a stepper motor without the use of an arduino and instead having the raspberry pi device control the motion directly. Currently working with the smaller version of the stepper motor found in my starter kit and continuing research related to plant root growth for my literature review. The links to the two guides that I am working with are below!
