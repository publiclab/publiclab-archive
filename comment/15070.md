Fusion 360 did not allow me to open the f3d file. It said that opening local files was not supported. I was not expecting that.

So I opened the most recent stp file and managed to modify the set screw holes and the indents on the back for the screw heads. I printed one and it looks pretty good. The indents for screw heads should be a little bigger, but I noticed that the angled leg holes are not angled enough. The angle from vertical is good, but the two legs should form an angle of 48 degrees with each other and they are at 30 degrees now. I'm not sure whether I should try to change the angle of the existing holes or delete them and make new holes. I will give it a try.
