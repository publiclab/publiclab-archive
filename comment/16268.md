Hi, Ujjwal! I'm particularly interested in the possibility for a bot for publicab.org; do you think you could sort of mock up a "script" to explore and articulate what this would look like so people know what you're proposing? Just an example like:

> NEWCOMER: How do I fix this camera?

> BOT: Hi, I'm an automated welcoming system. Can you choose a topic that your question most relates to? (Options)

Or something like this?
