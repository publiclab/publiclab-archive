That looks like a hollow cathode lamp.  But there are other kinds.  It should have the element on the base plus usually the operating current range.  Go with the minimum current needed.  As the lamps get older, the minimum current needed goes up.  The amount of life ( as in operating hours) in the lamp is not huge.  Some of them have a running time meter on the side to let you know how much time they have been in use.  I think you want to stay away from these if possible. One of the papers from 1979 showed using a microwave, instead.  By the way, I listed the two lead lines as 283 nm and 214 nm.  We used 214 nm for Zn.  If needed we would look for an alternate line around 217 nm.  For Pb.  My bad.
