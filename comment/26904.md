Hi subir, 
Great work. I have a few doubts that help to get more insights,
1. Does the SPS30 sensor measure Indoor or Outdoor data alongside RH and T? 
2. Is the SPS30 sensor placed inside the casing or outside? If there is a window/ passage for airflow, what is the size?
3. The distance of Govt. installed Air quality measurement station to yours? Since you installed across 5 locations in Pune and the government installed station is only 1, near Karave road.
