Thank you for appreciation [@warren](/profile/warren), I do believe designing a nav bar in the above mentioned manner will make the page look more organized. Regarding the presets, run, save and the entire bar I've redesigned it by adding few user-friendly icons also we can add tool-tip for more clear information about the icons. Also I've tried implementing the full-screen edge to edge layout. Kindly review the changes ðŸ˜Š
