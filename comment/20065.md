Thanks for info. 

I should have googled those operating systems and read about them. Those two operating systems are what web shop I was going to order parts from offers installed to sd card. 
I have installed Raspbian to sd card before but was going to be lazy this time.

I found raspberry pi zero w locally so I will not order anything from that web shop after all. My spectrometer will be ready in few days. I will go and buy parts tomorrow. 

Only thing that is missing for my experiments is colorimeter reagents. I might buy single aquarium water test kit so that I have something to experiment with before my reagents arrive.

I will print case instead of build it from Lego.
