One other item got some attention.  The company put some antimicrobials in some of their products.  These can often be irritating to humans, especially in high levels.  I don't know if you could find out when then problem started and see when they put the anti microbial in the products.  See if the two match.  

It's not an answer, but it is a start. Good luck.
