Hey [@warren](/profile/warren), as you know that I am working on Sensor Data Upload and display library, here's one of my queries on it:

The point where you mention about implementing a page where per user information about the CSV files is displayed and they can DOWNLOAD them from there, so I have a major doubt there. How are the files stored in our server? Do we use some kind of bucket there or ActiveStorage? And how exactly is that implemented? If you could please shed some light on it, it would be great help.

Thanks a lot!
