I especially appreciated your introduction of a "false positive" of laundry detergent here; excellently displayed too.

In your first two conclusions, are you distinguishing between "oil type" and "molecular size of PAH compounds"? In the first, you say there's no "simple relationship" but in the second you refer to a "correlation" -- just to be clear, you're saying that dilution effects prevent a simple relationship, but that there is nonetheless a correlation? Or that the correlation is present for "molecular size of PAH compounds" but not for "oil types". Thanks!

Finally, based on [@ethanbass](/profile/ethanbass)'s suggestion, I'm curious if you see a strong correlation between dilution and opacity -- perhaps measured with an absorption spectrum. If we could determine a predictable relationship there, we could potentially control for dilution by using opacity as a metric. If that were possible, would that put oil type differentiation in our reach, in your opinion?
