Very nice experiment, and a great set-up for measurements. I bought a 405-nm laser a couple of months ago, and that's a much better wavelength for inducing fluorescence. I've been having fun just pointing it at things in the house and seeing what fluoresces. I need to haul the spectrometer out and see what it shows. 

The wavelength is visible to the eye, and is technically violet, but the eye is only weakly sensitive so it looks like a faint violet spot on a surface that does not fluoresce, such as a metal (illuminate the surface at a glancing angle, don't try to reflect the beam back at yourself). Most white paper fluoresces white, showing a brighter spot. Colored plastics also fluoresce brightly to very brightly. So don't be deceived by its apparent faintness; it only looks faint because your eye does not respond well at that very-close to ultraviolet wavelength.

Look for "blue laser" on eBay and the like - they are surprisingly cheap. Most of them emit at 405 nm, the wavelength used for BluRay readers, which is mass produced. Those sold as "true blue" usually are more expensive at emit at 445 nm, the wavelength of the blue LEDs used in solid-state lighting. I bought a "UV flashlight," but its output looked violet to the eye and showed up as a broad peak around 405 nm, so I suspect cheap "UV lasers" you see on eBay may also emit at 405 nm.
