Any hollow bolt can be a cable penetrator. These cost $1.20 apiece, but you also need two [nuts](http://www.mcmaster.com/#94804a320/=112xu3n) and [rubber washers](http://www.mcmaster.com/#90133a420/=112xsom). The hole is only 2.3 mm in diameter, so not many cables can pass through each one. Those nice Blue Robotics penetrators have a bigger hole (about 5 mm?) and better facility to glue the cable in.

For many uses a temperature sensor can be inside the enclosure, but some uses might call for more contact with the medium. Waterproofing the temperature sensor for external use is a separate challenge.
