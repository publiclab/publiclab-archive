Hi [@warren](/profile/warren) !
As you know when a user click on location icon , hover event is also triggered, so along with the pop-up, tool tip also come so I think they both get overlap which not looks good.
You can see in below screenshot:

But on any other place which is not added (,i.e., there is no location icon there) , there is no problem in adding tool tip. As you can see below:

[![Screenshot_(1764).png](/i/43691)](/i/43691?s=o)


So either we avoid tool tip on overlapping places or we can place tool tips in downward position for these overlapping places only. As you can see below:

Please let me know, if this makes sense and please share your opinion regarding this.
Thank you 
Regards
