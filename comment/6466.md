I think the new consistent relationship between NDVI values and color is good. If this causes some infrablue photos to produce boring (all the same color) NDVI images, that is also good. That is how we know that either 1) everything in the photo has the same plant health or 2) the infrablue photo was not useful for some reason. In the latter case, we could tweak the infrablue photo and process it again. That would not be an improper workflow. Many variables are adjusted to get a good infrablue photo: camera, filter, camera color settings, white balance, ambient light, post-processed dynamic range and color balance. The goal is to find a combination that produces infrablue photos for a particular subject which produce meaningful NDVI results. Any tweaks are valid, as long as they produce truly meaningful NDVI results and you then use the same combination if you want to make comparisons of plant health across multiple photos.  In order to compare your results with others, all those variables must be reported for each photo [as described here](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/07-17-2013/infrablue-minutiae). Eventually groups of Infragrammers could adopt standards to facilitate comparisons and ease of reporting.

Although Photoshopping your infrablue photos is a valid method, I have found that if you don't get good infrablue photos straight from the camera, it is hard to get meaningful NDVI results, and even harder to establish an efficient and repeatable workflow.

It can also be useful to have more than one NDVI color table for different types of infrablue photos. For diagnostic purposes, I have been using this one:

This clearly distinguishes NDVI values below zero (which should not be living plants). It also has continuous gradients to preserve detail from the original photo. It also makes all maximum values (255 or NDVI = 1) black and all minimum values (0 or NDVI =-1) white so you can immediately see if something is forcing lots of pixels to the limit. It has the disadvantage of not being very friendly to those with protanopia. 

Eventually, a sandbox at the Infrapix app could allow users to creatively adjust their infrablue photos, adjust the resulting NDVI images, and apply various color tables. In the meantime, standardizing the process will help diagnose issues and establish good infrablue capture protocols for scientific ends.
