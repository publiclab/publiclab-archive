I really like the idea of a script that can rank each image for motion blur or focus blur.  Figuring out which of your photos are blurry before you include them in a map (MapKnitter), stitched image (ICE), or structure from motion (Hypr3D) requires examining each one closely.  A script could substantially improve this type of workflow and the quality of the final product.  Ideally, the script could distinguish between motion blur and poor focus.

Maybe Ned knows if ImageJ can do this.
