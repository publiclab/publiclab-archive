From [@jeffalk](/profile/jeffalk) on the midwest list:: [@ramseysprague](/profile/ramseysprague)  You say " I was back there for an hour and had to evacuate twice due to the dust. “ What monitor are you using for what particulate size and what did it show for the hour you were referencing? If it is so visible perhaps a video would work? Or hanging out a clean laundry and showing the effect on the clothes? Larger particulate are assumed to be “less of a health hazard” and the standards for TSP (total suspended particulate) allow for large amounts. Sometimes large quantities of dust are more of a safety hazard than a health hazard, eg producing poor visibility for driving, etc. The standards are also over a 24 hour period so if excessive dust is only for a small fraction of 24 hours it will not average as high. If you want more comments please supply more detail.
