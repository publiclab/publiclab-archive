The correction data is in a CVS file and the Solux data is in a TXT list file -- both with 2 columns (nm,value). The data should remain in this (nm,value) pair format and not be converted to an image. There is no need to plot the correction data as the 'values' are not % units like the SWB spectral plots -- the data can just be kept in a background data file which is internally read when needed. The Solux data values are all relative linear intensity with no units and so would be similarly used as background data for individual lamp calibrations at some point. I'll e-mail the files.
