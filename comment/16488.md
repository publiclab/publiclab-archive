Hi, [@ashwinvasudevan](/profile/ashwinvasudevan) - I think that, although I like the idea of the app, `image-sequencer` may need a lot more back-end infrastructural work before we can start developing an app around it. I know you're interested in Android work, but do you think you could think through how you might work on `image-sequencer` as a stand-alone module before starting to work on more advanced UIs for it? Perhaps you might suggest some html/javascript-based UI work that would be more general purpose, but that could also later be used in an app?

Thank you!
