Small edits to the card: 

we can delete the "within 2 degrees" helper text. 

we can reduce size (thus increasing detail of tube) of the card

zip code is missing (or some sort of location)

Have we figured out the color scheme that would most make the transition from waxy orange to pink most apparent?

I found a black background to be better than white or grey. maybe we could have the nice detail of the tube with an arrow pointing to a blacked out section of the  card that would have the sticky tape on it?  or we could try a black silhouette of the tube? but we might need something bigger than that so that there is contrast of the whole visual vicinity
