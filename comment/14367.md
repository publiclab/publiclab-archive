[@Warren](/profile/Warren), I don't see that anyone is suggesting credential based peer review for PLab but IMHO, that does not exclude filtering based on good science. Two papers, on the same topic, with one showing clear data, good methods, understandable and supported conclusions needs to be 'positioned' in some way as separate from the other which has clearly flawed data, lacking in explanations and drawing conclusions which are not justified by the data or methods. An "outside" reader should have the clear impression that the repository and work it contains, as a whole, is clearly organized and identified on the basis of the scientific process. This goal does not diminish asking questions, contributing observations (even if flawed), suggesting new ideas, etc. -- it just has the responsibility and mechanisms to put that material in an appropriate context of good science.
