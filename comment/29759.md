The results you were given aren't "top of the line".  To be honest, the book keeping is kind of shoddy. Normally, there would be reference to the test method used for the PCE testing.  If they did it in house, there should be test methods, standardization, things like that.  If it was sent to an outside lab, it would be PO numbers, finalized report numbers, etc.  That would give a trail to follow.  Doesn't look like they wanted any trails for anyone to follow.  Good luck with your project.
