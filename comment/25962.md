Sorry for being late. But I agree with the solar solution. I have personal experience building wind turbine. But we just have to assemble and install the turbin correctly. If not, the turbin won't give you power it is rated for.

In my case, the turbin was rated to 1000 watt but it turned out to give us only 200 watt max.
