[@DavidMack](/profile/DavidMack) Good catch! My notebook measures test 2 at 38.78, right next to 39.78 for the next test!  I edited the note.  thanks!

You're right about the Buck not being perfect-- sometimes it gets bubbles in the cylinder and gives a good bit of trouble-- a "side bubble" will form on the film traveling up the cylinder and drag the film sideways.  All my MiniBuck tests for this research note were in triplicate-- the only variaion I had was in test [#2](/n/2) where it reported 312 twice and 313 once.  

I agree a glass apparatus would be better-- I worry about compressing or messing up the plastic.  The problem is the price!  A 1000ml Burette is used to calibrate the Mini-Buck, and [its more than $200 with shipping](http://www.coleparmer.com/Product/Pyrex_2094_Large_Volume_Class_B_Glass_Burette_1000_mL_1_Cs/EW-34542-34)!  I did some tests with [a $45, 50ml pyrex pipette](http://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/06-04-2015/using-soap-bubbles-for-pump-calibration#c11923)-- the biggest I could buy in-town-- but the bubbles just travel too fast in that apparatus.
