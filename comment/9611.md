Hello Warren.  Yes, we did many enhancements since our last post.
Particularly, we developped bus itfces (i2c, spi) to get better results (not depending on the master clock.)  That is for CO2, hygro, ir, temp sensors.
Regarding "live infragram", we added a true C websocket server on the Rasp PI side so to retrieve the video and derive the NDVI realtime from the stream.  
We also noticed that adding a "sigmoïdal contrast" -- which is a "dynamic color scale" -- would permit a better vision of the plant's health.
