I love the "spoiler" idea - although i guess we'd want to rename it for this context, like a "get the details" or we could call it an "accordion" or i dunno... we could imagine a Markdown extension for that sort of thing. Right now it can be done in HTML, but it's a little cumbersome. Maybe some kind of `###> Section title` syntax would make everything until the next title collapsible?
