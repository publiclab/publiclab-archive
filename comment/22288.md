I'm personally reticent to begin prototyping hardware-- or even sketching it-- before defining the goals and test environment.  For me, the existence of a clear hardware prototype too early in a process can obscure my focus.  I commend [@stoft](/profile/stoft) for taking a step back to seek that focus, even this late in the project.  For me, I like to see five steps happen before the brainstorming and prototyping stages:

* Understand existing approaches to a task
* Observe how people use existing equipment to accomplish the task
* Identify the Point of View of different people who desire different approaches to a task
* Prioritize the Point of View the people whose needs I identify with or who I'm being asked to identify with
* Establish task goals and test requirements for equipment ot accomplish those tasks
* Brainstorm about meeting requirements
* Prototype to meet requirements
* Test
* Repeat

These get us to the test requirements that create the kind of bounded space that gives brainstorming some focus, and for me, its those boundaries that make it fun.   Most of the steps in the design process take me up to this first question below, and I follow along on trying to identify specs and tests from there: 

* What action should the device be capable of performing?  (target data outcome)
* What is the minimum features required to complete the action?
* What are the desired features to complete the action smoothly?

The question of minimum specification can be approached theoretically or normatively. from a design standpoint, a normative and historical approach is how I've worked- having never been on a theory-driven team.  My normative approach is:

 * What hardware is normally used? (standard specification)
 * What hardware has historically been used? (the first hardware can be a proxy for the minimum spec)
* What comparisons to existing hardware can be done to verify prototyped ideas? 
* What correspondence is desired?
