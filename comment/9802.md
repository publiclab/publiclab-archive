Follow up: 

1) Does the reflective material go in the back of the bottle?  

2) By laser-camera alignment, so you mean that the horizontal beam from the laser was too high/low or some such for the dimensions of the image that the camera captures?  

3) Would you say this is was an unexpected problem given prior successes?  I guess my question behind this question is, is the kit as currently designed ready for use?  I'm planning on holding a workshop a similar workshop in October.
