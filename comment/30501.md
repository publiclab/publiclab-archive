A carnivore is a species that only eats meat. 
The 4 spheres are: Biosphere, Hydrosphere, Atmosphere &Geosphere. Omnivore is an animal or person that eats both meat and plants.  An example of an omnivore is a bear. The different type of biomes is producers, consumers, and decomposers. Biome is determined by the species that live in that specific area.  Burmese pythons are very invasive not only to Florida but also USA. Invasive species have ever been the cause of several animal extinctions! Burmese pythons has a strong preference for swampy lowlands where it uses the water's edge to ambush prey. Florida and India have similar latitude and their average winter temperatures. The Burmese python completed change the biome in astronomical ways due to the fact it's not supposed to be here. It has now become the number one predator in the state of Florida. Today's population is 7,969,883,720.
