I'm also leaving some suggestions on [@vidit](/profile/vidit)'s post here: https://publiclab.org/notes/vidit/02-16-2018/gsoc-18-email-notification-overhaul

...suggesting ways you two could (if both are accepted) team up on this broader project. And even at the proposal stage, you could each work on breaking down and planning out different parts of the project, to not have to duplicate too much. There's /plenty/ of work to go around, no worries!
