Light is a wave, but think about it as particles. The 'beam' of light is aligned within a relatively narrow angle between a slit and the diffraction grating / prism. The camera / detector is in a fixed position, aligned so it sees the full-range of the spectrum. Now, glue it down inside a box so nothing can move.

The remaining variables are the light source aperture width (size), the slit aperture (width) and the orientation from slit to grating. If you imagine having a true collimated light source, that would help -- the slit only works best for small aperture sources at a significant distance from the slit. As you can see, the spectrometer works best when it is fixed position, fixed source alignment and then calibrated for frequency (CFL).
