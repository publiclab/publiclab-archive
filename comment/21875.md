I want to highlight three big takeaways from this layout that stand out to me:

1. card-based profile listings
2. displaying the map to the right of the people listings
3. the "leaderboard"

I'm interested in approaching this in parts 1-3, and each would need a bit more design iteration. 

For the card layouts, (noting this [prior reference to card layout](https://publiclab.org/notes/amitsin6h/03-03-2018/gsoc-proposal-card-ui-ux-implementation)), let's look at the many many types of card layouts in Bootstrap:

And some ideas from Froala:

I'm interested in what is the most relevant and critical information to include in the people card design. What if it looked a bit like this?

Is there more we could include in there? 

Maybe instead of crowding it, we could have a `...` menu to offer more:
