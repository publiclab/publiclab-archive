Thanks for the detailed explanation. I've seen that back scatter is a popular cofiguration what do you think? you are getting the same axis as transmission yet you are not getting direct illumination.
I had a thought about trying multipass - having the laser bounce through the sample several times - would that help.
I found some long pass filters  made by Schott that are not too expensive  I hope they are up to the task.
