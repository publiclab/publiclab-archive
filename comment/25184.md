This is now working on Infragram's online demo at https://publiclab.github.io/infragram/ -- give it a try!

It'll work now on webcam microscopes, and as soon as [#pi-builder](/tag/pi-builder) rebuilds in https://github.com/publiclab/pi-builder/pull/53, we'll have that feature on all our pi-based kits.
