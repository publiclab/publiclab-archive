Hey [@warren](/profile/warren)! I have indeed been working on the sample scripts, but the kind of request/response model the bot follows would totally depend if we're using ML+NLP or if we're hardcoding conversations. If you could tell me which one we'd proceed with, I could totally put up the scripts for reference (I would need to write them in code anyway).

Regarding the minor details, I guess it'll be more fruitful if we could discuss that in person, because:  
A) I would be able to receive instant feedback and actually "discuss" rather than just stating my opinions.  
B) This being a collaborative project, the opinions and doubts of everyone need to be addressed, rather than again, me stating my preferences and opinions.

Please feel free to drop me a mail or a comment in here regarding when you would be free to discuss this in the next couple of days 😄

Regarding the architecture, again, that's something we would need to discuss and that's exactly what I meant when I said that we need to make a design doc. Personally, I believe the best way for us to do this would be to host the bot on heroku for the time-being and trying to shift it to our own servers later in the future if we have the given resources (which are pretty minimal, tbh) and only if it promises a significant speed boost. (Which it will, if the majority of the bot activities would happen at publiclab.org rather than on Slack or Gitter or OFTC).
