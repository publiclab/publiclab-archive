A high-school teacher friend asked us for faster build that is less dependent on soldering because they don't have the budget for that kit. So we've developed a "minimum  version" of the 2019 classroom logger using pre-made Dupont jumper cables (as we did in 2016) to reduce the build time down to about 1 hour.  I've also added support to the code base for using the indicator LED as a light sensor, so they can use the logger with their existing curriculum right away.

This version of the Cave Pearl is probably the best starting point for people building  their very first Arduino-based data logger.
