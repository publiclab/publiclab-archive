[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) FWIW I used a Kalman filter algorithm for my TDS analyses with data from a similar setup data logger setup.  I believe that my original implementation used the median but eventually ran into issues with timing and filling the array. There aren't significant speed or storage space issues. For me it was finding the interval that filled (a smaller array) and the power on interval.  I am eventually going to go back to the median and work out the timing issue because I feel that for my application the median is the better estimator for TDS. From what I gather from your application, the difference should be unimportant UNLESS you experience rather extreme measurement values. Since the variation in TDS measurement is so small (relatively) than there is a good likelihood that the bias is insignificant.  


A very simple check for your application is to monitor both on a test run and check if the bias is significant.  print out the array values  and calculate mean and median off-line. plot the difference.
