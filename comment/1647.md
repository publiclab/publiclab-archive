I am not sure if the logarithmic relationship is correct, but if it is, then Beer's law experiments using variable path length or concentration will allow that to be calibrated as well.  Even if the curve is neither linear nor logarithmic, doing the Beer's law experiment will allow for calibration of the response vs. input power relationship.  So, you put a sample in front of a constant output source and vary the absorbance of the sample.  Even easier than the dye solution I mentioned in the previous post is a color filter; place one layer of filter, then 2,3,4,5 etc. in front of the slit and measure the response.  So, if one layer blocks say 20% of light two will block 36% ([1-.8x.8]x100).  Plastic sheets of filter material for theatrical lighting are cheap and can be used for this purpose.
