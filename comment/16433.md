[@stevie](/profile/stevie) I would require input on the design side of things, as we would need the design to "just work" for everyone. I proposed a basic design concept (one that uses FABs and floating panes). I would love if you guys could propose ideas and make suggestions regarding the design as the current concept might not be the best we could do. Also, it would be super cool if we could somehow also involve people who are active users of the website to know what exactly they expect from us both feature-wise and design-wise. Thanks.
