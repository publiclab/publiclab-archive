Here's a dirty and slow way to determine the 50% mark:

Firstly, normalize your data by dividing the integral (area under the curve). The area under the curve may be approximated using Riemann sums, trapezoidal rule, or any integral estimation algorithm.

Riemann sums are easy to implement: Left sum = y0 * (x1 - x0) + y1 * (x2 - x1) + ... + yN-1 * (xN - xN-1). right sum = y1 * (x1 - x0) + y2 * (x2 - x1) + ... + yN * (xN - xN-1). Use one (arbitrarily chosen), or use both and average them together.

Take your y data and divide each y-value by the integral to "normalize" it. Now your y-data sums to 1. 50% of 1 is 0.5.

Add up your normalized y values until the total is >= 0.5. In this pseudo code, I'm normalizing and accumulating at the same time:

        integral = approximate_integral_method(y, x)
        accumulator=0
        for i in range 1..N-1:
            accumulator += y[i]/integral * (x[i+1]-x[i]) # accumulate the left reimann sum
            if accumulator >= 0.5, return x[i]

Minimizing the redundant math out of the for-loop:

        integral = approximate_integral_method(y, x)
        accumulator=0
        target = 0.5 * integral
        for i in range 1..N-1:
            accumulator += y[i] * (x[i+1] - x[i])
            if accumulator >= target, return x[i]

I'm not seeing any obvious or easy way to find that 50% point otherwise, but I imagine there must be some way that is better.
