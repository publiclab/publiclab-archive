I really loved your idea. Yeah this is a huge project but we can plan for the most important part of this project in the GSoC. Other remaining things can be taken up in other contests like GCI'19, Outreachy'19 and so on. I think React will be a better choice than Angular. What do you think?
Let's ask Jeff if he is interested in this migration of frontend. React has a lot of capabilities that we currently miss on [pl.org](http://pl.org). This will definitely give better UI.

This project will require a lot of needy greedy details for the implementation. We can't directly implement this without the proposal. So, I completely agree with you Naman to have this on GSoC list of 2019. Great idea. Loved it.

Thanks a lot.

> Hey everyone! I participated in GSoC'2018 as a student developer with public lab. I am also looking for GSoC'2019 opportunity. I have multiple projects in my mind. For now, one of them is : As publiclab website is getting bigger and lots of new features are getting embedded into it, it is affecting website efficiency and performance and also making the new feature more difficult on the website as the website grows more in future. For such a big website like publiclab we have to move somewhat to any front-end framework in near future. So what we can do is that we can parallelly work on the frontend framework like angular and when it gets mature enough we can replace it with rails frontend. In the process, we can obviously use rails backend which is already made. This is a very big project (could take a whole year to complete )and I have just added the idea so that people can do brainstorming over it and find out is it worth doing this or not.
