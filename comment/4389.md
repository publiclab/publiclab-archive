It happened in Eusebius, Ceará, training of professionals for the Digital Mapping Social and Environmental Risk Guided by Youth and Adolescence. Promoted by UNICEF and conducted by CEDAPS, the event has trained 60 people who aim to empower young people so they can identify sites that have risks in their communities.

The intervention is designed for all teenagers, which build the scripts and decide which environmental risks are mapped in the community, according to what was discussed earlier. This mapping is done by using two techniques: one uses mobile phone equipped with GPS, and another with a delta kite, which 'houses' which is a camera recording these areas. This way, they can observe how waste is discharged in the territory, as well as sewage, coexistence points, risk of collapse, outbreaks of dengue etc.

As a result, maps are formed situation of each locality that serve as basis for the preparation of Local Plans of Action Techniques were developed by Mobile Experience Lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology - MIT, and the Laboratory of Science and Technology Public Open (Public Lab) which, together with UNICEF New York, conducted the training team CEDAPS. Since 2011, the CEDAPS already implemented the project in 10 communities: Andaraí, Borel, Batan, City of God, Complexo do Alemao, Monkeys, Pleasures, Rocinha, Willow and Vulture.
