Hi, this is really great, thanks so much. One thing on strategy - we had implemented a basic set of CSS hiding styles on the existing page, but have found that they break easily and are hard to test for. This motivated us to propose a second page template specifically for printing, rather than using CSS to hide non-print content. What do you think of this strategy? It would still use much of what you've described above but could make for a cleaner and less brittle approach. 

We would also love to see you complete a first-timers-only issue from https://code.publiclab.org -- do you have one you could take on and share? If not we can make you one to suit!

Thanks a ton for your proposal!
