Nice project. Is there an established standard to quantify CO2 or VOC in air flowing into pump?  I was thinking of either Arduino or Adafruit CO2/VOC sensor but not sure which is best for robust and consistent sensitivity.

To improve on design I would use more than one air line per system, so like real roots, should not be too centralized. I would wrap line and uniformly punch needle holes so all parts of substrate/roots get air exposure, if that makes any difference in sequestering. 

Thanks
