Hi LaPa - 

You can contact me at horning@amnh.org and I will send you the spectra. You can also look at this research note for links to sites with spectral libraries: https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/11-01-2013/why-a-red-filter-should-work-well-for-ndvi

If you can contact a University they might be wiling to scan some common items for you.
