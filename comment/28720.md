Project CyAN with the EPA might be of interest.  It is using a newly launched satellite to track cyanobacteria.  The new satellite was launched 5-6-2021. They seem to be concentrating on Vermont, which is relatively close to Maine.  Then again, you are probably already going down this road.  Good luck.
