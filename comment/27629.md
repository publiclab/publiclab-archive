I'm learning a little about the EPA's National Emissions Inventory dashboard, which can show emissions point sources by industry. The interactive report from 2014 is here: https://gispub.epa.gov/neireport/2014/. And the dashboard for the report is here: https://edap.epa.gov/public/extensions/nei_report_2014/dashboard.html#point-db. 

This screenshot from the dashboard is for several pollutants reported for plastic, resin, synthetic fiber, or rubber products plants.

The map doesn't show much for WA, but maybe you can cross-reference with [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1)'s suggestion to start with EnviroMapper?
