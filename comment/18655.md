Thanks for the help. 

So far I've written a script in python which takes the photo, saves a copy to my media, then takes the middle line of pixels and converts it to a dataurl before trying to post it to spectral workbench. Problems I'm having so far:

Both chromium and python are throwing website certificate warnings at me, so I've had to work around that.

The post request returns a 200 code, but i'm not seeing anything new on my dashboard.
