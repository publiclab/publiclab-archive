The first article from" research gate "is a little more interesting.  It has lead forming something similar to chelates.  The summary of the article was only available, but it had chemical structures drawn.  It maybe fluorescing, but it is probably mostly due to the compound "L" (a mixture of methylenedianiline and anisaldehyde).
