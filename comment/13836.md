Right and I'm still believing that repeatability errors with the PLab-web-cam-slit-hardware configuration all too often hints at differences which are not really there or can only be validated when there are sufficient samples variants to test. ..... I mention the acrylic as those are the ones PLab sells so many?of and others may be using them already or in the future; so they are a candidate just because they are cheap and  available (even if they are unsuitable for some solvents).
