     Biodiversity plays a crucial role in the well being of an ecosystem that exist in planet Earth. The more diverse a ecosystem is, the more healthier and successful it is. Organisms are interdependent to each other in a ecosystem so if one type of species get extinct or endangered it can lower the population of other species or extinction. We humans rely on biodiversity of our ecosystem to feed us with the resources we need. For example the blue fin tuna population has decreased 95% due to its high demand. The tuna cannot reproduce fast enough from humans overfishing so they are now considered a endangered species with a high market value. Constant release of greenhouse gas, pollution, contamination, deforestation, overfishing and so forth has caused to decrease our planets biodiversity hence adversely affecting us and other species. We humans have to learn how preserve biodiversity so that we can enjoy the fruits of nature provide us.
