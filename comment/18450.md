I have not used graphing for live debugging because I didn't know how easy it was to do. I use the live serial monitor in the Arduino IDE all the time, but it also has a serial plotter built in. So if values are written to serial from an Arduino singly or separated by comma, spaces, or tabs, the serial plotter will display a time-series graph.

This doesn't require anything that you don't already have working if you are using sensors connected to Arduinos. I'm sure there are advantages to using the additional WebJack hardware (but I bet few people reading this could name one) and there are certainly benefits to knowing how to code in Processing (but asking the common folk to learn ANOTHER language just to make a graph is not the best way to encourage computer literacy). 

Maybe I need to hear about a scenario in which WebJack would save the day:

We are trapped in an old power plant that is about to blow. The only things we have are a phone, an Arduino, a headphone jack, and MacGyver's phone number. What should we do?
