That last setting in the video looks like it might be getting useful. I think the photos will still have more overlap than they need, so you could probably rotate just a bit more with each step. I can't tell exactly when the camera is shooting, but you must be right at the point where the camera might not have enough time. So another second or so delay could be safer. You will probably need about 15 to 20 positions to capture a 360 panorama in portrait mode with 50% overlap between photos. With a photo every four seconds, you can get the full circle in less than 90 seconds, which is a good goal. 

You must have CHDK running on the camera to do this, so it's easy to set the shutter speed to 1/800. The CHDK menu options changed in the newest versions of CHDK. 

**Here are the old menu options:**

Extra Photo Operations

- Disable Overrides [Disable]
- Override Shutter Speed Value [1/800]
- Value Factor [1]
- ...
- Clear Override Values @ Start [ ]

Turn the other stuff on that page to [Off]

**Here are the new menu options:**

Enhanced Photo Operations

- Disable Overrides [No]
- Override Tv   type - [Ev Step]
- Ev Step Value   [âˆ™][1/800]
- ...
- Disable Overrides on Startup [ ]

Deselect the other stuff on that page [ ]
