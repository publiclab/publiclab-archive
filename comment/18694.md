I also wanted to note that if anyone's looking for a few extra things to add to a proposal to round it out, we have a lot of issues we'd like to solve in JavaScript over on the Editor project:

https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor/issues

These can be pretty tough, but they're super important! Any help appreciated! (thanks [@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) and [@liz](/profile/liz) for helping get these documented!)

I'm going through and leaving comments on folks' proposals but please do ask each other for input as well! 

Thank you! There are some great projects up here :-)
