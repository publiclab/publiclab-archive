Hi [@MsSema](/profile/MsSema), what an incredible post!

I would love to chat with you about this project.  Public Lab has been working on getting the bucket air monitor in the store, which is a low-cost analog whole air sampler that also does benzene (along with like 96 other chemicals).  Many of the issues you raise are things we've been trying to document as part of that project,  including the specific interest in benzene in fenceline communities.

Here is a link to the wiki: https://publiclab.org/wiki/bucket-monitor
And to some of the resources:  https://publiclab.org/tag/bucket-monitor

If you have interest, I'd love to maybe join forces on collecting some of these resources together. We are doing an OpenHour call on fenceline air quality monitoring on December 9 and would love to invite your group to participate. https://publiclab.org/tag/openhour
