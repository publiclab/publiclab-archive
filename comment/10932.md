Insofar as reproducibility builds trust and trust binds and commits a community I think it does matter. Reproducibility across devices seems the more important and will lead PLabbers to more reproducible results. Reproducible results are not always correct, but at least we know they're accurate. 

I agree with singling out certain reports as targets for replication though in practice I think when a note is of high caliber you're sort of drawn in and naturally want to try and replicate it. Does mere emulation of good behavior in others constitute replication?

The amount of leeway allowed for notes that are vague and rambling as often as they are rigorous and detailed is what I most enjoy about reading PL research. I like the idea of encouraging readers to continue along lines of a thread of work that someone else initiates. Having an ability to search and group along arbitrary lines of interest/level of detail would be nice too. Maybe I should figure out how to implement that. 

Chris, I'll see your Karl Popper and raise you a [Charles Sanders Peirce](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce). Your 'ramblings' always enlighten and as you point out this is an [an issue for pro science](http://www.nature.com/news/a-blueprint-to-boost-reproducibility-of-results-1.16222) too.
