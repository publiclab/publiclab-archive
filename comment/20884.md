Hi Jeff, Thanks for getting back.  I tried both Chrome and Firefox.  Similar behavior on both.  They are updated as far as Ubuntu is concerned but I suspect that they are not the same level update as windows or apple boxes see.  If I use VLC media player the camera does work and I see a spectra, so at least to that level it is working.  
Thanks again.
Jim
