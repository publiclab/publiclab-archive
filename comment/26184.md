The goal of the custom white balance hack is to fool the camera into wildly exaggerating the brightness of the blue channel (when using a red filter). The result is that the values used for NIR in NDVI computations will be a few times greater than otherwise.

Using a  grey card (18%) will not alter the default blue:red ratio very much if at all. By definition, grey has about the same amount of red and blue.

Chlorophyll reflects both red and blue light, and will not alter the blue:red ratio very much. 

Neither of those white balance settings will produce photos very different from any of the standard white balance choices (sun, shade, tungsten, fluorescent).

Finding the proper color surface for a custom white balance is tricky because the amount of NIR reflected from it matters and NIR is invisible to us and therefore does not affect the color we see.
