I think the rotameter is going to be easier to use than the critical orifice/differential pressure method, especially with a fluid manometer.  You just need to make sure it's vertical and read perpendicular--the better rotameters have a mirror backing to aid in getting a good reading straight on.  Read it at the widest point of the ball--the center.

The problem with the combo valve/rotameter is you are measuring the flow under vacuum since the rotameter is between the valve and the pump.  Under vacuum the reading is going to be higher than at atmospheric pressure--so the difference in reading makes sense.  To get a more accurate reading you need one end of your flow meter to be open to the atmosphere.  You can apply the ideal gas law to correct to standard temp and pressure but unless you're at high altitude simply leaving one end open to atmospheric is good enough.   

If you buy the valve and rotameter separately, you can set it up differently: 

pump <- valve <- rotameter <- tube <- reference flow meter (attached at the beginning and end of sampling)

Regardless, these types of roatmeters are not going to be super accurate and are not perfectly linear--some readings will be closer to actual than others on the scale.  The cylinder method will be more accurate.

also, I know you're trying to make this really cheap but I also like to put a filter between the tube and the rotameter to protect the equipment from dust.  The better valve sand rotameters can last decades.
