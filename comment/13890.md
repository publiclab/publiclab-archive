PeauProductions has this filter [here](http://www.peauproductions.com/collections/filters/products/ndvi-blue-infrared-filter):

This must be a dichroic filter. The narrow bands could produce good results. We don't know how much cross contamination there will be because we don't know the sensitivity of the blue channel to NIR light, but it could be substantial. The red channel is probably not very sensitive to blue light in that narrow band, so the red channel should have a pretty pure NIR signal. The PeauProductions site seems to suggest that there is no "spectral cross-talk" between the bands, but that is false and depends completely on the camera (Bayer filters) being used.

Unfortunately the visible light it captures is blue, so it will do a poor job producing NDVI that distinguishes healthy from stressed (or dead) foliage. That should be added to my list above of things that will  allow more discrimination among levels of plant health -- 5) use a red filter, not blue.

Do you know what shutter speed and ISO you were able to use with this filter?  Not much light passes through this filter, so ISO might have to be high to allow a fast shutter speed. High ISO will produce noise in the photos, but that might not matter much for NDVI images.

I'm a little confused about something. NDVI for healthy foliage should be around 0.5, and that requires the NIR:VIS ratio to be about 3:1.

Your filter passes equal amounts of NIR and blue light, and sunlight has a ratio of NIR:blue at those wavelengths of about 1:2.

In order for NDVI values to compute to reasonable values, the red channel (which is capturing NIR) has to record values three times higher than the blue channel (which captures blue light). We don't know what the sensitivity of those channels is to the two bands of light they are capturing. Assuming they are equally sensitive, the light captured by the red channel (NIR) would have to be six times brighter than the light captured by the blue channel (blue). I guess healthy foliage reflects an order of magnitude more NIR than it does blue, so that works. A complicating factor is that the blue channel will be contaminated with NIR light and will be brighter than it should be. But it must work out to be close enough to produce NDVI that looks right.

This might be why some blue filters can provide direct computation to NDVI without custom white balance. When a red filter is used, the blue channel captures NIR and that channel is not as sensitive to NIR as the red channel is to red. Maybe I am less confused now.

I think you are right about a DIY approach to calibration. You might not need to know the exact proportion of incoming NIR and blue reflected from your targets. If you are close, and use the same targets and values in all your photos (or missions), you should be able to correct for the day to day (or hour to hour) variation in light quality and sun angle. 

Your camera captures a rather pure NIR (800 nm) image in the red channel. You can use that to measure the relative NIR brightness of various target materials. A normal camera could be used to measure the relative blue brightness of the targets. It would help a lot to have some materials with known spectral reflectances, so check this out: http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/interactives/spectralcurves.php.
