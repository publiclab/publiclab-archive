This is definitely interesting to think about!

With our check-in process, what has worked is:
1) Imposing a schedule (ex. sundays we open check-ins)
2) Having someone overseeing is pretty essential, mostly because of distributed responsibility & priority - anyone can take on the task of making sure check-ins are opened every week and go according to plan, and if [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano), [@sidharth](/profile/sidharth), etc. and I stopped overseeing it it's definitely possible someone would take over and oversee that the next check-in is opened. But without that responsibility being assigned to a smaller group of people, there is no way to ensure consistency with that. There have been instances where it was past the deadline and nobody offered and we intervened.

I think that the models can be combined! One (maybe two) people will spearhead. People can volunteer for the tasks still and sign up (capped to an appropriate # that the person spearheading decides) and can help with any aspect, but ultimately it will be the responsibility of the person who spearheaded to make sure things keep moving and pick up any lacking areas.
