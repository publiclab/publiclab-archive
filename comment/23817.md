 Hi Dave, 
I just heard back from Sony regarding the IMX219 Sensor response. Here's the pdf and a screenshot:

Although it does trail off, it seems like it should still give usable data up to around 800 nm, from the way it looks. Once I get all the parts confirmed, maybe I'll make a post with as many datasheets as I can find for everything and just list them all together.

For the solar spectrum, I think you're right that a smooth spectrum emitter is better for relative intensity, since it won't be affected by the atmosphere. I'm really interested in getting a calibration for absolute intensity though (e.g. Watts per m^2) and that's where the sun comes in handy.

For example, for an 8 month period I measured direct solar radiation with my lab's spectrometer and calculated its intensity, and found that when there are no visible clouds or haze over the sun, the intensity is quite consistent with solar elevation. I published the data recently in the last Appendix in my masters thesis ([here](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/15850)). One thing I didn't get a chance to delve into is how closely my measured data corresponds with simulated data, for example solar simulators like [MODTRAN](http://modtran.spectral.com/modtran_home), although I'm also looking for an open source version of a solar simulator that can take the atmosphere, water vapor, latitude, longitude etc. into account.

If the simulated data match closely with measured data, which I'm hoping it does, then it would be reasonable justification to use the sun as just a absolute intensity calibration. So the order would be 1) use CFL for wavelength calibration 2) use Solux for relative intensity correction and 3) use a few clear-day direct solar measurements for absolute intensity calibration. Maybe if I have the diffuser on, and use a very short integration time, the sensor won't be flooded, but I am not aware if there is a minimum integration time that can be used for the NoIR camera hooked up to the Raspberry Pi.

As for the plant measurements, I think I should add a paragraph in the research note describing how this will be used. It's not for looking at the plants, but just for characterizing the light sources that will shine on the plants. This is for lighting research in horticulture, where I want to design various light treatments to see how plants respond under different spectra. However, in order to have useful data, it is highly important that the light spectra and intensities are well characterized so if you compare two spectra a) it's controlled and repeatable and b) it's a fair comparison so one treatment is not giving more photons from 400-700 nm than the other so the differences will be attributable to spectral quality and not due to overall photons available for photosynthesis.

Definitely, looking at the RGB reflectance of the plants using photos would be another useful form of analysis, which I may do. I've seen other people get reasonable results by putting the leaves in a scanner as then the lighting is very consistent and you don't have to deal with shadows.

Sorry it seems this comment is a little long winded!
