Thanks for your answer, i found some not to expensive filter that block above 700 nm,and some that block under 700 nm so it's not the perfect solution but should be a start.A red filter will be amazing but no idea how pricey it can be.I will also try the blue filter.My goal ( learning purpose ) is to compare the different options of calculation vegetation index.
