This looks good. I especially like the idea of adding arrows and pointers.

How can we solve the problem of organizing a lot of annotations into a particular area of a map.

It would be e good to have an organized structure of show/hide for different categories of annotations, like places, directions etc. which the user will be able to specify. This way users viewing the map can also opt out from viewing certain annotations.

Thoughts?
