Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on the planet earth. It gives us resources that helps animals, plants, humans, and other organisms to survive. In this case, our survival is being limited because of interference with the food web. Us humans are destroying the food web by overfishing and contaminating the waters and ecosystems with our chemicals, that are destroying our food source and home. Biodiversity has genes that makes up the building blocks of life to the diverse ecosystems. Each living organisms depends on another living organism for survival and if the dependent is gone it destroys the set up.
