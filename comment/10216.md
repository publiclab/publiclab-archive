This is a great analysis. I like your interpretation of the filter spectral graphs. Rosco confirms that 2007 passes more light (10% transmission) compared to 74 (4% transmission). The difference we experience is not that great, maybe because the transmission in the NIR is more similar than it seems (their graphs stop at 750 nm but the camera is sensitive to 900 or 1000 nm). Also the extra green transmission of the 2007 might not influence the blue or red channels that we need for NDVI. But it's hard to know exactly what is happening because the camera's Bayer filters allow non-target colors to get into each channel, and it is hard to find good data about that for each camera.

Your results confirm that a common artifact of this process is high NDVI values for areas of dark shade. For some reason, shady areas have higher than expected values for NIR (or lower than expected values for visible light), so NDVI values are artificially high. It would be good to learn more about this, but until then avoiding shadows and avoiding interpreting NDVI results from shadows is called for.

The white balance you used seems to produce infrablue photos that are not as orangey (for foliage) as others that have produced good NDVI results. In [this note](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/07-17-2013/balancing-act) I describe differences between performing the custom white balance in the shade versus direct sunlight. I subsequently settled on doing white balance for blue filters (with blue paper) on sunny days in the shade, and white balance for red filters (with red paper) in direct sunlight. Oranger infrablue photos have higher values in the red channel which is used for NIR, so NDVI values will be higher, and closer to the expected range (0.3 to 0.7).  I think oranger infrablue photos also produce a greater range of NDVI values for foliage, so more subtle difference in plant health can be discerned. Similarly, bright bluish foliage in super-red (red filter) Infragram photos produces the best NDVI results. 

Comparing the difference between the red and blue histogram averages is a good way to predict the nature of the NDVI results. The greater the difference, the higher the NDVI values will be. In Fiji, if you can highlight a very small area of typical foliage with only one tone, the histograms will be narrow distributions. That will make it easier to choose the value for comparing (choose the peak) and will make the average value a better estimate of the peak.

I look forward to your results with red filters.
