Some how I was not notified about this even though [@warren](/profile/warren) included me.  I found it by accident on chat, but Jeff is right, I am *very* interested in this.

[@sashadev-sky](/profile/sashadev-sky), this is a really really great article.  Can't express how necessary this article is.  It should be linked to in any welcome bot.  I did not know about the third step at all (except generally speaking as something that's good to do).  Still, my experience has been that after your FTO, you're a bit lost at what to do next.  This answers the question of how people take on another issue, but still make sure they have support.

[@warren](/profile/warren), there is a method the wording of which we can play off of from medicine and modify since we're doing it slightly out of order.  It's called ["see one, teach one, do one"](https://blog.positiveonline.org.uk/post/161090345890/watch-one-do-one-teach-one).  This article explains its rationale, history, and benefits well.

I guess our model is more "do one, do another, support one".  I don't think the first one is quite "do one" though.  There's something about an FTO which is "do one" but has something extra to it.  So I would say we need to fill in the blank with the following:

" blank one, do one, support one"

Maybe...

"Try one, be supported by someone, do one, support someone"
"Try one, be supported by someone, do one, create one, support one."
"Find one, try one, do one, create one, support one."

I'll think on it.

Something I might have mentioned in the call is that it might be good to have a multi-tired support network.  Maybe after completing your FTO, when a new person needs support, you are part of the first group that is notified.  If you can't figure out the problem, then you can escalate it to more experienced people.  It's sort of an FTO for learning how to support an FTO.

As an aside, I'm not sure if the "read more" link is auto-generated or if you put it there but the "read more" link is the link to this page.
