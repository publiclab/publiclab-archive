Well, I hadn't done any correlation analysis yet, but I tend not to trust algorithms that yield a single number value judgement.  To better qualitatively show what patterns that I think I see, I have plotted the part of the data record from around 25 mins up to 60 mins since the start of the experiment (segment 1).  (Note that the datetime stamps in the raw data are likely not absolutely correct since we had forgotten to synchronize the RTC.)  The data sets have been rescaled by subtracting their means and dividing by the standard deviation.

The remainder of the data (segment 2) - which was not plotted in the original post - understandably looks to be not as correlated.  I don't know what happened here, but I will say that I've been tossing and turning a bit more now that I've taken to sleeping on my side within the last year.
