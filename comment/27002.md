Ha! [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1)   so Check your community members' HVAC system.  if the brass or other metal couplings have corroded, ask how often the resident has to replace the fittings. 

 I have seen people bring their corroded HVAC parts to public meetings to comment on Air Pollution permits. I think it was in Bogalusa, for the paper mill.  As you know, air conditioning is an essential service on the Gulf Coast.  Residents here pay a lot of mind to our HVAC bill, will probably remember the service fees for replacing the couplings on the unit outside their home.
