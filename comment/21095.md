I believe the second part is already complete! We implemented it a few weeks ago :-)
  

Thanks!

> Hi [@warren](/profile/warren),  script to go back through posts and tag first-timer posts with first-time-poster tag, retroactively so they show up at [https://publiclab.org/tag/first-time-poster](https://publiclab.org/tag/first-time-poster), to improve stats on first-time posting  Sounds good to me. Also, along with that, I think all the new posts which are created by new contributors, they should automatically be tagged to keep the stats correct.  Thanks!
