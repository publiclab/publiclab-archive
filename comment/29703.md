Maybe transmission is possible.  Most of the materials we analyzed could only be tested with reflectance.  See if that makes sense for the materials you are working with.  It may take a fair amount of sample prep to make The samples usable with transmission.  The instruments we used were near infra-red reflectance(NIRR).  They used overtones of the standard infra-red that are common in labs.
