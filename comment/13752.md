Aha; a very good description which explains things I'd read. I think it also directly supports my present contention that with a 400nm source and the fluorescence band down to at least 400nm, the best spectrum we can capture (to have the most data to work with) is when the source does not bleed into the shorter wavelengths. So, on the basis of the chemistry, a 405nm laser will provide the better option. I wonder if a 405nm laser module could be found (separate power instead of the pocket battery type) which might afford additional power levels for greater sensitivity.
