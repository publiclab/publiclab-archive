Thanks Chris. I launched from street at corner up from my house. I walked back down to court across the street from my place, stayed in position for a while and then landed there. I should have indicated I used the default startup mode. Photomerge does allow different projections. I used the default. I'll stick screenshot of the choices screen in the note. Don't know how to use markdown to put it in comment.
