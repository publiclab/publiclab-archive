Hi VJ, this is a very clear statement, thank you! from an email thread earlier this year, there are six additional Portuguese speakers (in addition to you and Ives) who have been contemplating a Portuguese language mailing list: [@Markos](/profile/Markos) , [@gufalei](/profile/gufalei) , [@wagnerjg](/profile/wagnerjg) , Ricardo Abad, Lucas Bambozzi, and [@P_Silva_82](/profile/P_Silva_82) . I just copied you into that email thread. I think this group has three interested organizers--which is very helpful.  How have the conversations between you and [@Ives](/profile/Ives) been going?
