[@rockets](/profile/rockets) Well.... a lot of possibilities for lessons learned. The good news is that between binges of travel, I spent a bit of time getting (somewhat) familiar with Arduino programming.  It's both easier and more complicated than anticipated.  The bad news is that yesterday I felt confident enough to start put all the pieces together and discovered that the Real-Time Clock on the original KnowFlow parts list (TOY0021) was the incorrect. Ordered the correct part (DFR0469) yesterday and that should be here in about a week or so. I noticed that the KnowFlow parts list has also been updated.  In the mean time, I'm going to try to get a GPS unit incorporated into the system. Haven't even started that yet, but would appreciate any thoughts on issues that might arise.  Cheers.
