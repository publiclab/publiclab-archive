This paper has some solid evaluation of the different ways to digest the squid guts: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X19301845

This paper looked at 64 individual anchovies from local waters: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308813073_Microplastic_fragments_and_microbeads_in_digestive_tracts_of_planktivorous_fish_from_urban_coastal_waters

I think that you can pick any number of fish to fit the amount of time and materials you can allocate to the project. If you would like to choose a number that has statistical significance, this thread has some information and resources on how to select the sample size for an experiment involving animal subjects that you could adapt: https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_can_I_calculate_the_sample_size_in_an_animal_trial
