Thank you for the in-depth feedback. I'm glad you liked the mockup designs .
Talking about the image it will be an edge-to-edge only previously my mockup was not able to define it now I have updated the mockup upon your feedback and also changed the sandbox page to a full-screen edge-to-edge app, vertically and horizontally.
I'm really happy that you liked how I organized the information on the page, have done a lot of brainstorming and researching on that .

There would be some challenges in particularly implementing the WebRTC library
I have updated the proposal and mentioned all the steps on how I will determine what the available resolutions are from an incoming video feed
Kindly have a look at my updated proposal [@warren](/profile/warren)
