There are a handful that all say the same thing when I search for "disable pi camera led":

    First up, we need to edit the config file.

    sudo nano /boot/config.txt


    Add the following line to the end of the file, then save it.

    disable_camera_led=1


    Next up, reboot your Raspberry Pi.

    sudo reboot

I've done this much with no effect. The only possibilities I can think of are 1) this is a newer camera/raspberry that this doesn't work with (raspberry pi zero that came with the PL spec lego kit) or 2) is the text in the config.txt file case sensitive?
