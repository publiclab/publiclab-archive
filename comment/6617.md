philippg, 
Ned Horning [has been working on these images](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/08-09-2013/classifying-trapa), and has tried some segmentation approaches, but maybe nothing fractal or with spectral coherence. It would be good to hear if you can learn anything using those techniques. Ned has put [two 4-band tiffs here](ftp://ftp.amnh.org/pub/people/horning/WaterChestnut). These have an NIR band added to the RGB photo. 

Some of the other clearer images can be downloaded as follows: 
In this [Google Doc is a list of 43 of the balloon photos](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApRLDm8W39oxdEpVdnV5VGlCMURMQ2NKMGo2Tk0xbHc#gid=0) with some metadata including the file name of the matching NIR photo. The twelve largest VIS photos and their NIR matches can be downloaded as in: http://fastie.net/Bin/12WarnerVIS/WarnerLkVis6911.JPG 
or its NIR match:
http://fastie.net/Bin/12WarnerNIR/WarnerLkNIR2051.JPG 

If the Google doc is sorted with largest (Size) at the top, the first twelve pairs can be downloaded by substituting the 4 digit file number in the above URLs (unique directories for NIR and VIS). These are 10 MP photos. The ones with the largest file sizes tend to be the sharpest.

Let us know what you find.
