Mathew,

Thanks for the optical semaphore link!  This really sent me down a wonderful rabbit hole of fun ideas.  I had no idea that Hooke gave a seminal lecture on semaphore tech whilst he was in the midst of characterizing how springs respond to stretching.  May those glorious times of working on projects in several different 'fields' return!  (I guess Hooke was working before there were these silly 'field' definitions ...)

One link I landed upon was this fellow at CalArts who seems to be wonderfully obsessed with data transmission schemes.  Really helpful historical review of various methods:
-- history of character codes: http://www.wps.com/projects/codes/
-- "bits, bauds, and modulation rates": http://www.wps.com/J/bits-bauds-modulation-rates.html 

I was talking to a friend a day or so ago, and he seconded Jeff's suggestion of simply looking at the signal amplitude as a way of conveying bits, rather than processing frequencies.  This certainly seems like a simpler scheme.  I'm not yet hip enough to all of this to see what advantages frequency might have -- I'm guessing it allows one to avoid having to establish a baseline amplitude when interpreting a signal via amplitude?  But anyway, might as well start with amplitude, as it's so much easier (I think).

Then I thought this morning (I think this just goes back to one of Jeff's original ideas): if one is simply measuring amplitude of a *visual* signal, is that relatively lightweight in terms of processing?  Certainly less processor-intensive than, e.g., reading a QR code.  And the code for interpreting e.g. a blinking LED wouldn't look so different from interpreting a high/low audio signal ...

The semaphore connection is, again, really, really cool.  Leads one to imagine all sorts of alternative communication schemes, involving everything from purely mechanical lens + shutter + ink recording, to laser modulation at a distance ... might be a nice way of getting around FCC rules on radio broadcasts, when communicating with an airborne platform (camera on a kite, Raspberry Pi on a balloon) ... could a light sensor on the ground interpret flashes from a strobe light on a balloon?  How much power do strobe lights require?  Too much fun  ...
