Great! Yes, little glitches do creep in but yes, this Solux corrected plot has a much better shape. I'm guessing the slight curve variation between 500 and 650, plus the peaking at about 650nm are similar to what I saw, even though the ideal Solux curve is more uniform. So, I take this as good confirmation of the approach. It also looks like you've handled any error accumulation at the ends to the algorithm is well behaved. Without individual, calibrated-Solux calibrations there probably a little unresolved error, but I'd think this is a good first-order improvement on system gain correction.
