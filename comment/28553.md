Finally have acceptable screen captures exporting from zoom (though frame rate is low) so we've been producing tutorial videos for Dr. Beddows instrumentation & hydrology students. 

Two that might be of interest to the folks here at Public lab:

Derive empirical fit constants with Excel's trendline   (24min)

Using Excel's FFT to derive a tidal frequency spectrum (22min)
[https://youtu.be/0VzX-3erjPI](https://youtu.be/0VzX-3erjPI)

Again, the focus for this series is on using real-world data from our loggers instead of the 'synthetically generated' inputs that many of the existing tutorials on YouTube seem to be using.
