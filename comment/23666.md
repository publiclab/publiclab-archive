I wonder what the experience would be like if you wore a simple air sensor for the day? Just plugged it into your power bank, put it on a lanyard, and maybe noted when and where you are when the color changes from red to green.

Something like this doesn't call for the device to log data on it's own, or come with any need for a deep understanding of the system. The red to green coloring is so intuitive that it means when you pull it out of the box, there's no need for translation or a big explanation of how it works. It could just be a really cool way for someone become more aware of the air quality on their commute. Depending on where they live, they might be able to compare their experience with city-logged data.
