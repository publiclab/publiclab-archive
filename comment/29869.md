Agreed with [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) for the USP as a good starting point. Furthermore, ICH Q7 guidelines would be a great starting point as well. Read "How to Handle [Laboratory Reagents](https://www.symteraanalytics.com/Blog/Handle-Laboratory-Reagents-and-Standard-Solutions) and Standard Solutions Prescribed by Section 11.16 of ICH Q7 Guidelines?". If you need anything else just let me know.
