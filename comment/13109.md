Looks great!  Two thoughts: (1) definitely important comment by Jeff about units and potentially a post-data-retrieval function for units conversion if you upload a calibration curve to the graphing platform, (2) do you have a "best practices" guideline or materials-sourcing for attaching the water bottle housing and keeping it submerged at a specified depth?
