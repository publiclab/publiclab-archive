Hi [@Warren](/profile/Warren),   For suggestions on where to go it might be helpful if you were to explain more fully by an example the question: "once something is well explored with low cost monitors, can we use just a few higher-end ones in concert with them to further shore up the evidence?"     Can we have an example of something "well explored with low cost sensors" and an example of the evidence that might need "shoring up"?  I feel that if what to do next is a practical question I would need context to make suggestions.
Thanks
