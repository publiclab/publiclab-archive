I just received the 4.5mm lens.  Unfortunately, it appears that the webcam lens is NOT the standard 12 x .5mm.  The lens does not screw into the on-board holder.

Additional measurements of the original webcam lens indicate that its threads have a .6mm pitch, not .5mm.  I determined this by measuring the change in distance between the front of the lens and circuit board when I turned the lens one revolution.

If it weren't for the fact that the lens is defective, at this point I would just use the camera as-is.  To prove my assertion about the lens, here's an image I took with the camera.  The object (my computer screen) was about the same distance the spectrometer slit is from the camera:
