[@mathew](/profile/mathew), good thoughts. I'm technical but from experience I see the need to include the market, user, next-bench, test, manufacturability, environmental, etc. factors in addition to the technical specifications, measurement capability and that relationship to what may already exist. My term is "thought experiments". It is often much more effective and efficient to work on hypotheticals with mostly questions to quickly weed-out the irrelevant and totally impractical and it has the advantage of including all those ares you listed simultaneously. You're right, non of these 'components' exists (shouldn't) in isolation but that also means they can, and should, frequently be viewed in parallel. The "trick" is to balance 1) not setting elements in concrete too early, with 2) making good choices soon enough to prevent analysis paralysis.
