Hey Jeff! Yes they were all from the same company (superbrightled.com) here is the part number - # RL5-UV0430-400. Originally I bought 10 LEDs but yeah, I toasted one, my fault, so I had to deal with the other 9 (I also bought an LED driver for a high wattage LED I got, which the manufacturer stated didn't need a resistor for lower watt LEDs, which this particular LED driver can interface with a TTL, but indeed this driver's max is 350ma and YES it did need the resistor, LED got smoked!

Soooo, upon testing the other 9 I ran them off my Arduino boards TTL so voltage would not fluctuate at load and I could get a more reliable meter reading on each LED. I may purchase an assortment from a variety of companies and test maybe 20 and try and get a derivative average on the probability of getting a "good" LED that one could use with a high percentage of repeatable results.

also here is the link to the set I created for the testing https://spectralworkbench.org/sets/3208

Thanks for the barnstar!
