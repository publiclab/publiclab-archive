Yikes, that's not good. Let me know if you need help getting a replacement camera.
There are [several on ebay now](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=a590is&_from=R40&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1311.R4.TR4.TRC1.A0.H0&_nkw=canon+powershot+a590is&_sacat=0) and I think I have another one here.
