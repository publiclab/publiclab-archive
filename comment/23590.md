Hello everyone !

I along with my two friends conducted a meetup in our college yesterday regarding how to start with open source contributions and how Summer of Code and outreachy can be a great motivation.

I also discussed about our organisation Public Lab, what we do and how we have achieved such a great number of new comers in such a few days. I discussed various projects under our organisation and spread some words about my contributions so that they can also be a part of the project. Here is a link to some of the photos we clicked : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19kFaC33iGz91Qs0PD3F4cS8wmeK_htV7?usp=sharing

Also my github username is divy123.
