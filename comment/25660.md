I don't know for sure whether your protocol with the RPi camera (use automatic white balance with blue paper) and my protocol with a Powershot (use custom white balance with blue paper) will produce the same results. 

Do you know whether the lights in your phytotron include NIR? NIR is not used by plants, so it would just consume more electricity and produce heat in the phytotron. My guess is that there is not as much NIR as in sunlight, but you will have to determine this. If there is not much NIR, you can just turn on some NIR LEDs when you take the photos -- the plants reflect NIR so they won't even know the LEDs are on. The proportion of VIS to NIR should be similar to sunlight for your computed NDVI to be comparable to legacy values. If it is not, your results can be meaningful for internal comparisons as long as that VIS:NIR ratio is constant (for all photos).

You are correct that this site is not designed for ease of access to the information here. The staff has long eschewed curation and instead tries to organize material algorithmically. This generally fails because few people interact with most content (few comments or "likes"), few authors tag their work in helpful ways, and searching and sorting tools are typically broken.

The controlled environment you hope to work in is perfect for doing real calibration. Calibration targets could be placed in each photo without too much effort. You will want enough targets to convince yourself that the calibration curve is robust, so start with four or five and then determine whether just two or three targets provide a good approximation of the curve. Targets must be well exposed in the photos (in the channels used for both VIS and NIR) so they probably should not be white or black (or the equivalent in NIR). If the DN for the darkest target is 0 or the DN for the brightest target is 255, then you don't know with much precision how much light of that wavelength is being reflected. Since all of the targets (including the darkest and lightest) must be well exposed in each individual photo, none of the targets should be very dark or very light. 

You will have to know the reflectance of each target for the range of wavelengths used for both VIS and NIR. A common photographic gray card of 18% reflectance might not reflect 18% of NIR, so you have to measure that value yourself. If you have the equipment to measure that (some type of spectrometer/photometer) you can characterize any material and will not have to buy targets. The nice thing about full spectrum commercial targets (rated for VIS and NIR) is that they reflect the same proportion of the incoming light at any wavelength in the rated range. So you do not have to measure any reflectance and do not have to know exactly what range of wavelengths your camera is recording in each channel. Both of those things are hard enough that it can be worthwhile buying expensive calibration targets.

Because you are working in a controlled environment you might want to consider using a two camera system. One camera can have a precise red filter (passes only a narrow range of red light) and the other a precise NIR filter. Such a system completely eliminates cross contamination and can be easier to compare to legacy NDVI (which uses narrow wavelength ranges). Such a system will still require calibration so you know what the real relationship is between the VIS and NIR light being reflected from foliage.
