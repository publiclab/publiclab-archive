Hi, in regards to your question about the placement of the DVD fragment, I think the idea is to align your camera so that it is pointed as close to the outer edge of the DVD diffraction grating as possible. The edge of the DVD, where the arc of the spiral is widest, will have the least curvature, so it should yield a straighter spectrum.
