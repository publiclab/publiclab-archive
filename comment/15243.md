I wonder if we could think about it more developed out as a feature, like perhaps it'd show up like an inset text box: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#panels-heading

Or we could call them "collapsible sections" and have it just collapse any paragraph following a header with this notation (just to throw an idea out there):

`## Header [+]`
