Outflows would not be a problem, as the imager is sensitive down to a difference in temperature of 0.1Â°C. It will also pick up developing faults/overheating in electrical services/facilities, inadequacies in insulation and active decomposition of biological materials. Other models have been used on body farms! Identification of animals in undergrowth is also another use, especially during clearance. Thermal activity underground and in waste dumps can also be identified.
