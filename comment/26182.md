If your K610 filter is a cutoff filter that passes wavelengths greater than 610nm and blocks shorter wavelengths, then it is similar to many filters used to make NDVI images. These red filters on a full spectrum camera (no IR cut filter) will record mostly NIR in the blue channel and red plus some NIR in the red channel. The values from the blue channel can be used as a measure of NIR brightness and the values in the red channel can be used as a measure of red brightness. There are two reasons that the recorded ratio of red to NIR will not be similar to that of the light reflecting off the scene. The red channel is somewhat inflated because it contains some NIR, and typical sensors are much less sensitive to NIR than to red. To correct that error a calibration procedure can adjust the levels. A much simpler correction is to boost the blue signal by some arbitrary factor. A proven hack with some cameras and filters is to fool the camera by using the custom white balance feature to exaggerate the blue brightness. Point the camera at something very red in direct sunlight and push the custom white balance button. If the camera allows this highly artificial color balance, photos taken in daylight of healthy vegetation will be turquoise and can be used to derive NDVI images.
