 Hi!  It's a somewhat complex set of projects, but basically, we want to be able to go to a place, shown on a page like https://mapknitter.org/miami (for say, the city of Miami) and see a map of that place. Then, we want to show all the images uploaded within the area shown. 

I've broken this open a bit in this issue here: https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/428 and it'll require some more discussion and planning! Thanks again!
