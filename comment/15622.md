Hi [@kevinvivergy](/profile/kevinvivergy), i have just tagged this note as an activity that others could try as well. I did this by adding the tag `activity:open-air`. If you could scroll up to the tag area on this note and click "click here" in the blue box to fill in the other details, it would help people find these instructions and try to build one themselves. Thanks and let me know any questions, i can support.
