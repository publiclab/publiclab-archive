Some vehicles, in most major cities, have to be tested annually for fuel emissions and mpg. Not all vehicles must be tested and the fuel emissions change.  Trying to keep track of the testing has gives me a major headache, though.  The rules change almost every year. But it should give a start in the correct direction.
