Hi Ernie,
Thanks for the great advice and information. To be honest I am completely new to te spectrometer hobby and most of what you wrote baffles my mind. I am glad you wrote all that stuff though, some day when I have the time and interest I will go through it all carefully and try to follow your advice step by step. Will be a fun project. I thought about it and to make it more simple I could have just taken a red laser and see the difference in water clarity that way, it would be just one curve instead of a hole spectrum of wavelengths. I never thought as far as to see what exactly is in my water, the experiment was done just to see if there will be any difference at all in the spectrum; and there was! :) Greetings from Sweden.
