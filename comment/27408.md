Hi [@Cogreg](/profile/Cogreg)! If you haven't seen it yet, you might find some helpful ideas in the comments for this other question about nutrients in hydroponic systems: [https://publiclab.org/n/16659](https://publiclab.org/n/16659). Soil testing comes up in the comments, namely the [LaMotte NPK test kit](https://lamotte.com/npk-soil-test-kit-3-5880). Please let us know if you end up trying any of these ideas!
