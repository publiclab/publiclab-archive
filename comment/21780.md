 [@nedhorning](/profile/nedhorning), actually your question/suggestion fixed the calibration. After switching to "Auto" to take a picture to compare and switching back to "Custom", it seems to have reset the white-balance issue. Now the image looks correct so thank you!

Question: when you do the white-balance process, do you recommend to place the calibration card outside in the shade or directly under the sunlight? Also, when you process images taken with the RED filter, do you use NDVIBlu2RedBW.lut color table in the Fiji Photo Monitoring plugin or is that color table for the BLUE filter?
