Fixation: is the process by which nitrogen is taken from its molecular form in the atmosphere and converted into nitrogen compounds useful for other biochemical processes 

Assimilation: is the process by which plants and animals incorporate the NO3- and ammonia formed through nitrogen fixation and nitrification. 

Decomposition: Plant and animal wastes decompose, adding nitrogen to the soil.   

Ammonification: Various fungi and prokaryotes then decompose the tissue and release inorganic nitrogen back into the ecosystem as ammonia 

Nitrification: Nitrification is the process that converts ammonia to nitrite and then to nitrate and is another important step in the global nitrogen cycle. 

Denitrification: It happens when certain types of bacteria take in nitrate and convert it back to nitrogen gas.
