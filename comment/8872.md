Hah! -- $15!  Sigh ... $5 would be even better, no? And it should have wifi too, right? :)  The basic version of an OpenLux + dust sensor with recording capabilities could probably come out around $40 or $50, depending on how cheaply the dust sensor can be secured. An Arduino UNO, without any ability to record or display, goes for around $25. So:  $50 would be a big improvement on $5000 or $1500, for commercial particulate matter sensors; but then, $50 will probably not be a particularly sensitive device, either ... hmmm.

I guess it depends on who the "we" is in "we can put them in arrays".  If it's an individual citizen scientist, paying out-of-pocket, then $50, for a device that will require tinkering, is probably too much for all but a few well-off geeks out there (though that 'few' might be sufficient for a successful Kickstarter, say).  If, however, we're providing an alternative device for agencies, universities, or non-profits who are currently fielding $1500 or $5000 devices to get basic dust measurements, then maybe $50 is 'doable'.  

That's all to say -- I'm seeing in all of this that I should be careful when employing the phrase 'low cost', full-stop.  Maybe "affordable for application X in community Y" is a better formulation ...
