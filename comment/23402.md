Warren got most of the problems with kjeldahl.  Here are a few more. Kjeldahl testing  takes some specialty glassware.  It's not terribly hard to locate, but it's not run of the mill stuff, either.  

The procedures take a while to get the hang of.  If you aren't using automated equipment, try to observe a lab doing the test before trying it yourself.  And it is rather time intensive.
