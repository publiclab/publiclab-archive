Cool, Techtonica looks like a great organization! This looks like a good timeline for the work. I agree with [@gauravano](/profile/gauravano) that it'd be great to see some discussion of testing; are you familiar with test driven development, or with Rails test conventions? A good place to start is the Rails guide:

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html

Testing is actually pretty fun (or is it just me? lol) because it is a way to demonstrate how your code works, to other people reading through it -- it literally runs it in the way you intend it to be run, and also shows how it shouldn't be run, by example. It also plays an extra role of protecting your work against future developers, however well-meaning they are!
