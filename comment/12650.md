Hello [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) and [@monoxyde](/profile/monoxyde),

I just realize you guys answered me. I really appreciate that you took the time to do it. 
I did understand how to use the .lut file, but Im still thinking theres something wrong with my pictures. Chris, I'll upload a picture, maybe it is a problem with the white balance and saturation of the lens? The truth is that I havent got enough time to read about it, I know I should do some kind of calibration, isnt it? I say that because when I work with satellite imagery I have to do a lot of stuff after working with spectral data of the image. I know this is someway different, but well.. im just new at this.

I'd just be very grateful if you can give me a quick advice on how to calibrate my camera... and [@monoxyde](/profile/monoxyde), yes.. I've been thinking that mobius cam is just not good enough, but I just need some kind of reference for my study, If I get to go for a further or in a more specific study, I'd definitely go for a Cannon. I've also been talking to my research professor about getting the chance to use some kind of UAV with multispectral cameras on it. This is really interesting, I've been only using vegetation indices from .tiff data (satellite imagery), so this is quite new for me. But first! I need to understand this! haha... 

Thank you, again, very much for your time [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) and [@monoxyde](/profile/monoxyde), 
Have a great week!
