Hi [@aldehyde](/profile/aldehyde), 

Apologies for the delay! That sounds like an incredible application of this technology. Are there ways that we can support you in that work? The validated version of the app should be ready in early spring. 

I'm sorry that the Google Play store was reporting incompatibility. You can download the app directly here:
