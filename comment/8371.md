Hallo Albertazzi
I bought a 30mm glass filter. Remove the housing of the filter and glue it in front of my cam. See pictures above (No idea how to put pictures in this comment). I try to remove the housing by unscrewing the big ring but did not work. So I use a dremel for it. Also never use crazy glue, 1 second glue super glue or something like that.
I know that in confined places the object you are glueing will get a white dust on it. Some chemical reaction, degassing of the glue. I use silicone glue, the one for windows. Works perfect, Next week I will test it in my drone and see if it will hold the vibrations.
Check http://publiclab.org/notes/gpenzo/02-16-2014/ndvi-720nm-850nm-filter-two-camera-setup-result for some more results.

Regards Grayson.
