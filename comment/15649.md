Even with that nice filter it won't be possible to get a pure red channel. The red channel is sensitive to NIR light, and NIR is transmitted by the filter, so there will be NIR mixed with the red. There is a [discussion of this here](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/11-24-2015/dual-band-pass-filters).

Some calibration procedures assume that a constant percentage of the red channel is NIR and subtract that proportion from the red channel for each pixel. Determining what percentage to use is a challenge unless you know the spectral sensitivity of the sensor or have a valid NDVI image of the scene or some other knowledge to use for calibration. A bigger problem might be that the proportion of NIR in the red channel is not likely to be the same for every pixel in the scene. Some pixels will have received no red at all, some pixels will have received no NIR, and other pixels could have a wide range of mixtures. But for green foliage in daylight, it might be a good assumption that there will be a more or less constant proportion of red and NIR.
