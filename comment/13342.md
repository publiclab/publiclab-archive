Hey Warren, thanks for your comment on my lab set up. Yeah I'm trying to do oil contamination testing here were I live (city point hopewell va) there are a couple of big chemical plants here right on the appomattox river(shore line,) a lot of people still fish off the shore even with the warning signs posted. I have learned that gas and diesel will fluoresce under a UV light but I want to see if I can detect smaller amounts of contaminants with UV-VIS and Raman spectrophotometry.
