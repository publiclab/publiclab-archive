I think there are many ways people exchange information, build ideas together, and while research notes are great, they don't necessarily cover the full gamut. 

I agree emphatically that we should keep working to make it easier/more rewarding to post notes! 

I also really +1 the idea of in-person and real-time (if perhaps online/phone) ways of exchanging ideas and working through problems. Both are needed. 

The drawback to online posted content is its ability to engage people, and the challenge of reducing barriers (as Chris points out) -- and of course lots of other things like navigation, or completeness, etc etc. The challenges of in-person or phone-based collaborations is getting that to also leave traces -- to contribute to a growing knowledge base in the long term. 

So, just to +1 the general interest in different ways of convening and knowledge sharing.
