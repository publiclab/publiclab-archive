Yes, I agree that this is a different approach to an issue that has had a lot of effort directed at software solutions. This is a purely hardware solution that sort of turns the whole problem of long-term logging upside down. It seems to be a breakthrough because it could allow a lot more people to be successful logging environmental data for many months at a time.

There is a lot more to do with this. I don't know the best way to organize it. Some of the things that might be considered are:

- Should the Riffle have an integrated TPL5110?
- Should the Riffle be used with Adafruit's TPL5110 timer?
- Will this work with the Nano Data Logger? 
- Should we make our own breakout board or use Adafruit's?
- Should we buy 100 of Adafruit's product to save 20%?
- What are examples of data logging that are incompatible with this approach?
- What issues have been overlooked?
