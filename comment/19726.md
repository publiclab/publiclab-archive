I would like to answer your question in a different way: 
1. In order to analyse a metal (by atomic emission spectrometry, AE), you need to put your solid metal into atoms. This is easiest done by an electric spark or arc. (The spark plug is atomizing its électrodes. By observing these sparks, one could "analyse" the metal of the électrodes.)
2. Each chemical element emits at many wavelenths (lines), specially the element Fe (iron). In order to "separate" one line of e.g. Fe from a line of e.g. Cr, one needs a spectrometer with a good resolution, probably 100 times better than the homemade spectrometer. Also, some important elements (in steel) like C, P, S emit only good lines at short wavelengths, where the lines are absorbed by the air. One needs a "vacuumspectrumeter".
3. If one wants to know how much of an element is in the metal, one needs to "calibrate" the instrument. By measuring the intensity of the spectral line in several samples of known content, one can establish a "calibration curve" and the determine the concentration in the unknown sample.
But the short answer to your question is: NO!
