Thank a lot all of you for the consideration and the suggestions! 

Chris, sincerely I didn't understand from your reply if you consider my direction completely wrong or just that I have a long way ahead. 

But, anyway I try to answer to your considerations: 

1) I'm using my camera in operative greenhouse (in farm), so the light and color conditions vary widely. And I can't change this. But I can choose some photos where the conditions are similar, for example in same hours of the day but in different days, and work with those.

2) I shoot several hundreds of photos, and I am continuing to do so, to make those movies the white balance is fixed in every photos. The exposure I guess is automatic so I think that vary in each photo. I think it is possible to set fixed exposure for each photo, but I have to understand how to do that.

3) I don't know how to calibrate the photos

4) Is there any lut that I can use in Fiji Photo monitoring plug in. If there isn't how to get the the "special lut  to differentiate changes in NDVI" using Fiji Photo monitoring plug in?

Best regards

LaPa
