I think the 500ma that can be supplied by the host USB port can be misleading. The spec says it must be able to supply 100ma and can switch to 500ma under proper conditions. Not sure if dumb powered USB ports behave the same. I also have found that my linux laptop can be stingy.

Don did some experiments with the charging circuit prior to releasing the board. Perhaps he can elaborate on the amount of current being consumed by the charger.

On a separate note. I changed my voltage monitoring point from the IO connector to the Vcc side of C14. The voltage spike/drop is not as significant but of similar duration and sufficient to reset the processor. Added a second 10uf cap in parallel with C14 (20uf total) and the noise is reduced and CPU is NOT resetting!!!

Getting waveform images from my scope is very difficult. It is one of those no-name Chinese scopes whose manufacturer "Atten" no long lists scopes on its site.
