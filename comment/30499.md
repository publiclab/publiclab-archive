The danger of the python can kill us humans, python is the cause of others upsetting the encasement.  So how much do python hunters make? Hunters are paid $8.25 an hour to prowl the wetlands in the SFWMD's jurisdiction, earning on-the-spot bonuses that rise with the size of any snakes they fell. Pythons up to 4 feet long get you $50, with and additional $25 for every foot over 4 feet.
