Hi [@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2), you're correct, this was not the original balloon that came with the kit, I had used that one a few times already and got new one for this flight. It's the 8ft Cloudbuster balloon which you can get here:

I had found an even better price here, but now they appear to be sold out:

These balloons say "chloroprene" rather than neoprene. Not clear on the difference as they appeared to work exactly the same for me. Cheers!
