Hi [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie),

For the algorithm Which I have put up above, I get a pretty faint image

But for for the following algorithm, I get a contrastful image, Like in Infragram:

https://preview.ibb.co/dLEw5F/vegetation_01_ndvired.jpg

Algorithm:

      input pixel => (r,g,b,a)

      ndvi = 255 * (b - r) / (1.00 * b + r)

      output pixel => (ndvi, ndvi, ndvi, a)

How is this? Could you please help me out?
