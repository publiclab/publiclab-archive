Hi [@vidit](/profile/vidit) ! Great mockups and i always love the flowcharts !

The proposal is very well documented ! Just a doubt here in the **digest email settings** :

I haven't used **whenever gem** ,and was wondering if it is possible to change the **scheduler task dynamically** ? Like if a user does not wants to receive digest email everyday/every week but wants to receive digest email after every 2 weeks or every month ? Is it possible ? 

Thanks and I hope this helps :)
