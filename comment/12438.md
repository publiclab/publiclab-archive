I am a little confused as to when you used a kite and when you used the balloon.  What sort of kite did you use?  Could you provide a picture of the camera mounted in the "case to protect our camera"?  I am with [@mathew](/profile/mathew) about the patch.  What is the balloon made of?  We have been using weather balloons that rip to shreds when they burst.
