Hi-

As noted above, chalk, e.g. chalk dust in classrooms, and cement manufacture, are major sources of calcium carbonate pollution.
Cement manufacturing is a dirty process, producing lots of air and water pollution, but calcium carbonate is a dangerous fraction, as far as I know, only when it's a dust < 10 microns.
Calcium carbonate is the main ingredient  in a lot of antacids and some calcium supplements.
 
In addition, one of the biggest producers of calcium carbonate dust  is lime kilns. I searched "lime kilns" and "pollution" and got some links that look helpful.  Lime kilns: CaCO3 -- heat --> CaO + CO2.... so they're major carbon dioxide emitters, besides emitting assorted unpleasant particulates in addition to the predominant CaCO3 dust- see article below:
2a http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00022470.1969.10466454    is useful; a table in the article notes the dust from lime kilns is 97.4% calcium carbonate. 

Of course, there's pm pollution along the whole production chain, from the limestone/dolomite quarries, to the hauling, production, and hauling again.

In case you're curious, once calcium carbonate is cooked into lime, according to the National Lime Association, "The largest single use of lime remains steel manufacturing, where it is used to remove impurities.  In construction, the dominant use of lime is in soil stabilization for roads, earthen dams, airfields, and building foundations.  Lime can be combined with certain additives to produce other metals and is also a key ingredient in mortar and plaster in lime slurry form." Source: http://lime.org/lime-basics/uses-of-lime/
