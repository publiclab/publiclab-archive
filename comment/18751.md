It wouldn't be hard to print out adapters for the v1.3 camera instead of the v2 camera -- the way the OpenFlexure project designed the OpenScad files is really well-done and modular so you can just change the "camera type" setting in one of the configuration files.

Are you suggesting making a single adapter that fits either camera?  This seems harder and less ideal than just printing two adapters, but it probably could be done....

When I was working with the v2 camera and an adapter designed for the v1.3 camera (the opposite problem you have) I was able to make it work reasonably easily with a knife and file, which isn't a long-term good solution, but it works.
