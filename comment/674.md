Excellent gut feeling, Jeff.

I powered the timer with 12 rechargeable 1.2v AA (=14.4v) and it worked fine.

It makes a lot of noise and the test lamp blinks on cue. The test lamp was powered by 3 rechargeable 1.2v AAA (=3.6v), and it also worked with three 1.5v button cells (=4.5v). 

I also tested it with the visible/IR pair of A495 cameras, and either output battery source triggered both cameras in perfect synchrony.  Either of these sources is also lightweight enough to fly, although the three button cells will have to be tested for endurance.

So now we need a 12-15 volt battery that is sufficiently lightweight to fly, sufficiently affordable, and will last for two hours.

Anybody know of such a thing?
