I've been racking my brains to figure out a way to measure the spectral pass of each color of the Bayer filter (R, G, B) because some images suggest to me that they are in fact optimal for different IR ranges -- images like these:

https://mapknitter.org/map/view/savethebay-providence-infrared

which show rocks and vegetation as, respectively, pinkish and purplish. Notice that the rocks used to shore up the beach (presumably granite?) are pinker than those sitting right at the waterline. [This picture](http://s3.amazonaws.com/grassrootsmapping/warpables/70491/IMG_4192.JPG) shows that most clearly. I'd love to determine if we're actually able to get 2 bands instead of just one broad NIR band. Ideas?
