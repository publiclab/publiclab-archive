[@viechdokter](/profile/viechdokter) yes, having a stable source helps isolate the noise source. I chose the Solux as I could measure the current as an independent check of light stability -- but still not a first-order measure like a calibrated optical detector. However, the advantage is it is broadband so any wavelength shift has near zero effect. True, a laser or LED is frequency stable, but the simple pocket lasers are not guaranteed stable output (simple battery + voltage multipliers which are not well regulated) though I could design an LED supply that is very stable. However, the peak is very narrow so measuring the same camera pixel line for detection becomes a possible source of drift error as the effective "gain" of being on either side of a sharp peak only ads noise and during the measurement it is difficult to observe, and eliminate, such shift. Not impossible, but more complicated.
