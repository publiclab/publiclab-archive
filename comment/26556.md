Regarding invites, to expand on this -- would be a way to create a special, relatively short link people could open in a browser (so each student in a classroom could do it) so you can create an account and post a response without needing to be moderated at all. In a sense the teacher "vouches" for people who use this special link. 

We'd need:

1. a format like `https://publiclab.org/post?invite=00000` and 
2. a way to generate and display such a link quite large on a screen
3. would the link expire after a week? 

Thanks!
