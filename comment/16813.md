I'm glad to see many of you have already started coding. I'd like to ask you all to think about getting a small project done I your first week (just the smallest first piece of your work plan checklist) so that you can have the satisfaction of seeing it published to production quickly. This applies to some of your more than others, but even if you're not coding directly in a place that'll go into production immediately (like [@ccpandhare](/profile/ccpandhare)) just think of a piece that'll do something discrete that you can assess at the end of the week. 

I'll do my best to respond to questions and requests for input tomorrow, but also reach out to mentors and to each other to help decide things and keep moving. 

Thanks!!
