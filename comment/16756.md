Yeah - so one idea behind the methods pages is to try to list out some of the "challenges" or next steps that'd be needed, and some of the remaining questions that would have to be answered to make progress. The [questions grids](/wiki/power-tags#Inline-tags) are designed to help encourage this kind of "next step" scaffolding. And I think you could describe a narrower method to try to coordinate folks' contributions, if you wanted to, such as saying "with an Arduino" or even "with the TSL2561 or equivalent" -- but that's just one option.
