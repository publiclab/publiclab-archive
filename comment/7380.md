You want to capture enough spectral variation between different surface features. If you only have 2 bands but have several classes then you may get lots of omission/commission errors due to spectral overlap. That's just a rule of thumb I was suggesting without first ascertaining your goal. 2-bands may work for classes with very distinct signatures across the wavebands you are using. Or you could use the time signature of a 2-band index based on a time-series of observations to sift out  classes based on phenological characteristics. It all really depends on the application and I recommended 3 bands just to be safe.
