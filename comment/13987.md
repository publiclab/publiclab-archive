Thanks, [@stevie](/profile/stevie). I actually added a section to our developers page outlining some of these suggestions (mostly from Gregor and Hoodie) to encourage non-coders to help set up issues to be welcoming to new contributors. It's an essential part of our work, and you don't have to know how to program to do it! [@liz](/profile/liz), you're already good at this:

https://publiclab.org/wiki/developers#Preparing+issues+for+newcomers

It also encourages non-coders to help with coder outreach.
