Those photos of the cool old ruins work fine in Fiji, and the mosaic images from ICE also work in Fiji.

The Photo Monitoring plugins stopped working for me recently. This was apparently related to a problem referred to in this note: https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/01-13-2016/packaged-photo-monitoring-plugins-available-on-the-github-repositoy. If you install the latest version of Fiji, the plugins do not work. So I followed the instructions and installed an older version of Fiji and the Photo Monitoring plugins work again.

The Mapir red camera produces a photo with three channels which record only red light. So any one of the channels (RGB) can be used for red light to compute NDVI. The Mapir NIR camera produces a photo with three channels which record only NIR light. So any one of the channels (RGB) can be used to compute NDVI. I chose the blue channel for red and the red channel for NIR because it gave the best result. This is rather unscientific, but any computation of NDVI without calibration is rather unscientific.
