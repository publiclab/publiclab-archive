Hi there! Ya I did get the idea from your comment and thanks!

Just to reconfirm the concept, so if I use red filter instead, it will absorb green and blue light, in which in this case I have to capture NIR value in blue channel, hence my image will show in blue color? 

Can you give your opinion on my result? Does it look promising? I was using one healthy leaf (left, bigger) and one unhealthy leaf to show the difference.

Thanks for your help again. You enlighten me :)
