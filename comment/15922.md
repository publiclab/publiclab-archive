Thanks warren, I got these cameras from Amazon, vendor digital_family, product ASIN B01FLVPZNY. It is now under $60. On pictures I just had some pictures which I am going to pass over some programs such as Fiji/ImageJwin64, Drawndvi, SPN-VEG to see how they compare vs raw. Once done I will post them here.
