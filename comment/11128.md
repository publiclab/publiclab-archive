Matthew - I found that static soaking helps soften the dye. But then the dissolved dye just sits in solution above the surface of the DVD-R fragment. Gentle agitation helps to move the dissolved dye away from the surface and allows more to dissolve. It does take a while. Placing the fragments on top of a clean white sheet of paper or paper towel, as you did, helps to judge if the dye is really gone. If not - rinse - repeat. Or you can get ugly on it and use the industrial strength limescale removing cleaner (cold) as I did originally. And I guess solubility may depend on the exact dye formulation / brand of DVD-R used.
