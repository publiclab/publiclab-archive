Hi kaushalsingh – Ait seems as if you are trying to calibrate the image using a reference target before you calculate NDVI? If that assumption is accurate you will need at least two (more is better) reference targets. It seems as if you have one with a reflectance of 0.8 and it would be good if you can find another reference target with a lower reflectance value. With at least two reference targets you can calculate the linear relationship between reflectance values from the reference targets and the raw pixel values in the image. Once you know the gain and offset (slope and intercept) of the line you can calculate the predicted reflectance value for each pixel in the image to create a red and nir reflectance image. Once you have the reflectance image you can calculate NDVI using the standard equation: (nir-red) / (nir + red). If that doesn’t make sense let me know and I’ll try to explain the process in more detail.
