Hi [@tanish](/profile/tanish) are you applying for GSoC or Outreachy? Thank you for your proposal!

I'm interested to hear more of your thought process in approaching these tasks -- for example, in "Refine the design and details of the newly relaunched dashboard with community input." what are some ideas you have for how to refine that page, and what would you prioritize?

Thanks a lot!
