wow awesome! [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) sorry to ask more but can you draw a picture on paper of what you expect these cables to look like? "A 1/4" stereo/phone plug connects to the HCHO sensor and two wires from that cable connect to the Arduino (tip of plug to A3, ring to GND)." -- specifically the "two wires from that cable connect to..." -- that's the part i can't picture -- what cable is "that cable"?. Also i'm communicating with Nick directly in case he hasn't been on the website today to help transfer all this
