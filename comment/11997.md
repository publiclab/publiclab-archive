[@bjl1629](/profile/bjl1629) Hi, The 5.1 board files are the most recent hardware designs released to the wild.  This summer I have been working on new hardware (and software) and I expect to have them finished and rolled out before long.  The new hardware (WheeStat 6.0) will be able to push the counter electrode to +/- 12 volts instead of +/- 1.65 volts.  The working and reference electrodes will still be limited to +/- 1.65.  The reasons for the extended range for the counter electrode are described in this Research Note: http://publiclab.org/notes/JSummers/06-19-2015/booster-hardware-improves-the-usable-wheestat-voltage-range.  I have a working 6.0 prototype on a pcb that I etched in the lab and I have three boards on order from OSH Park.  Assuming the boards from OSH Park work alright, I will make them available on the OSH Park shared projects site (by the way, you know that you can get the 5.1 pcb from the shared projects, right?).  I am also working on a design that will allow the working electrode to run to more extreme voltages.  I don't think that many people have applications for a potentiostat that runs past +/-2 volts, but I will probably make one anyway.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you out.
