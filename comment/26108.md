Hi, just found it interesting when i read about the UV Hound - it's actually not a mass spectrometer but an optical spectrometer not too dissimilar to our kits, but in the UV range. The technique is called Ultra-Violet Differential Optical Adsorption Spectrometer (UV-DOAS) and they said they use Beer's Law just like our activity here: [#beers-law](/tag/beers-law) 

The readout looks really similar to https://SpectralWorkbench.org although it's in a range we can't detect - UV, so down to 200 nanometers (our [kits](/lego) only go down to 400, pretty much same as human vision)

Also it needs to pass through 1000+ feet of open air, and get reflected back in. probably because air is so transparent:

I bet the UV image sensor is super expensive, driving the cost up. 

They mention it draws on EPA Method TO-16R - which is actually for infrared -- https://www3.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/airtox/to-16r.pdf - "Long-Path Open-Path Fourier Transform Infrared Monitoring Of Atmospheric Gases"

Here's a gas industry video with more info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMemTf0djaI -- it's about the OPSIS UV-DOAS, which is another product that uses the same technique. But I wasn't able to figure out the price. 

The OPSIS site has a nice diagram of how their spectrometer works; it's basically the same as our kits but in UV, with a really long beam path:

They even use the same spectral matching technique as us. But their spectrometers are probably really well intensity calibrated or have a great baseline comparison spectrum and very little noise or drift.
