After having reviewed black-body radiation, I am coming into agreement on the tungsten bulb approach because there is a simple equation relating maximum emission wavelength and temperature, so one can use that relationship and the observed spectral peak to calculate the filament temperature and then the black-body curve using the Excel spreadsheet available from http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/mathstatmodels/examples/PlanckXL.html.  That site will also lead you to the max wavelength equation.  Probably best to use a clear bulb, as the diffuser on some bulbs might modify the color of the light given off.

Re: teflon tape purity.  Teflon does not mix well with other materials, so the plumbing tape is probably pretty pure, and the material that I have used in the past is bright white with no hint of color.  It is also difficult to get teflon to stick to things, so special treatments are needed to make teflon coated pans.

I can't speak for all webcams, but the one I have now has an option to turn off auto white balance.  I did not want to dedicate that webcam to the spectrometer, so I ordered the kit and will end up using the webcam that comes with the kit.
