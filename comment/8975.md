nice simple mount-- the box makes it very easy to keep everything parallel. it also seems like running the pole straight through the box is a nice firm attachment system.  

The fiberglass was not too flexible for you? I have previously done some pole photography with bamboo and it as very wobbly at 12m and really limited to 6-8 for stability.
