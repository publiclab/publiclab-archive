So, I'm new to air.  i used the Emergency Response Mapping Application a lot.  
There's a lot of geographical information on ERMA for your region, and you can do quick searches for facilities, like so:
https://erma.noaa.gov/gulfofmexico/#/layers=14+36086+36078+408+36081+404&x=-90.80996&y=30.01808&z=13&panel=legend

It's nice because you can share the URL and even upload KMLs of your area of interest, if you have specialist reports.

For searches for pollution, I also use the ERIC Radius Search from LDEQ
https://business.deq.louisiana.gov/Eric/EricReports/RadiusReportSelector

I imagine that other states have similar services. 

ERIC was just updated with 2019 emissions.  These are only major emissions.
Here are the data limitations:
