Hi Chris, thank you very much for the help!

I'll choose better times and avoid shadows the next flight. And I'll try correcting the exposure too!

I don't know if I understood exactly how to do the color balance, I was left with some doubts... Correct me if I'm wrong please.

1) When you said shortcut, you meant I could for example use a blue led or a blue paint as target? Or do you have another suggestion?

2) Once I get good results with the target in the picture, can I (for the same camera settings and lighting conditions) calibrate using the pixel color of the target from the picture that gave me the best results?

I'm thinking about buying the infragram's Mobius camera. From what I was reading, doing the color balance on this camera is simpler because config file includes information about color balance. Can this color balance be used to make comparable NDVI images? Do you think it's worth changing the camera?
