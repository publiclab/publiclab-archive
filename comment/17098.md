Oh.  Didn't see your other other question. As far as what this is for we should really try to create a larger page with history.  In the meantime, it's inspired by a [presentation about OpenStreetMaps mailing list dynamics](https://archive.org/details/sotmus2013-Alyssa_Wright_-_The_Threads_of_OSM_Discussions_-_Are_the_Doors_Really_Open-68098504) by Alyssa Wright et al. using the no longer maintained [OpenThreads](https://github.com/seamustuohy/openThreads) library.  We'd like to do this, but for Public Lab.  As an aside, the openThreads library is really great it's just that it was written for Mailman (I think?) and not GoogleGroups.
