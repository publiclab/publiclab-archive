Hey Tom - I'm the lead dev for Spectral Workbench and I'm eager to implement this. But we need to figure out what the process would look like. 

I kind of imagine we could:

1. determine if webcams are consistently sensitive for a given brand and model
1. if so, use a calibrated light source ($$) to create a profile for each device type
1. users can choose a profile for their given device and it will auto-compensate spectra from that device

Alternatively, what about something like:

1. use a highly consistent light source (which doesn't change over time, over minutes or over its lifetime), scan it with a precalibrated commercial spectrometer whose sensitivity we know
1. we use it to derive a sensitivity (radiometric) calibration for a range of webcams 
1. we ship that bulb around to people with different webcams

Whether model/brand webcams are consistent is a big IF, but it'd make our lives much easier.

We should also check out the technique in [this paper](http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2012/Habel_2012_PSP/Habel_2012_PSP-Publication.pdf) as discussed in [this mailing list discussion we had](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/publiclaboratory/NZJOSeLlZPw)

So maybe the first step is to figure out that question of model/brand consistency. I'll have a bunch of SYBA webcam soon and i think i have several identical Creative webcams. This also begs the question of if we can make really consistent spectrometers.
