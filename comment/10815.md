InAs (Indium Arsenide) looks almost perfect, with a high sensitivity and a peak sensitivity at 3400nm (3.4micrometers) when cooled to 196K. 196K is reachable with dry ice, which sublimates at -78.5 C, which is 194K.  Dry ice cooling has three major advantages over other strategies-- it's cheap, it doesn't draw electricity, and dry ice clouds look really cool.

Here are a list of suppliers I found:
