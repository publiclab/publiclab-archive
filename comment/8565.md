well, there's no explanation on your website.  By googling the name on the sensor name visible in a photo of yours, I can see that its an e-tape milone:
http://www.milonetech.com/About_eTape.php

 You might want to put this text right on your sensor page "we use the E-tape Milone, a proprietary solid state resistor whose resistance changes with its saturation, allowing depth measurements.  The maximum length available is 32", defining the operational depth change measurable by the Strembot."  Other info that might be good on your sensor page: temporal sensitivity, calibration issues etc.  Then next time when you say "see website" someone like me can actually find what I was looking for.
