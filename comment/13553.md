Hi Rayishido, 

Nice Pi photos. Claytonb is correct about the shadows. It's a common artifact for dark areas to have very high NDVI values. In your photos, the shadows in the NIR photo are not nearly as dark as in the VIS photo. So there is a big difference between NIR and VIS in the shadows and NDVI computes to very high values. [Calibrating the process](https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/07-22-2015/introducing-the-calibration-plugin-for-imagej-fiji) should improve the results. 

The Photoshop process you used is quite tedious compared to using [Ned Horning's plugin for Fiji](https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/01-13-2016/packaged-photo-monitoring-plugins-available-on-the-github-repositoy). Below are results from Fiji.
