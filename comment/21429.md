Hi everyone- one minor (but very important) step we left out (now corrected). The Raspberry Pi needs to be plugged in to a power source to work! There is no internal battery-- there are side by side power and data ports on the side of the unit: you won't need to use the data port for anything unless you plan to flash your own SD card (the cards we ship with the kit are pre-flashed).
