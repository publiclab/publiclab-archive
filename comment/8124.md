Ok that's good to know. At the moment, I have a canon ps g12 with the schott bg3 infrablue filter that is saving photos as raw, and my canon dslr rebel t3 with full-spectrum should be arriving shortly. Additionally, my university's biology department has kindly lent me a high-end field spectrometer. My plan is to compare the nrb raw band reflectances from the g12 to the field data. Additionally, I will be doing the same with the dslr, but the process will be to use a visible light passing filter to take the camera to stock (from ldp llc) to take target photos, then get the field spectro data from those targets, and then switch the filter to a 715nm and greater passing filter (blocks visible) and photo the same targets. 

My question before about the jpg's was related to whether the use of jpg with white balance versus raw w/o wb would be the likeliest explanation for differences in contrast between cameras (versus physical differences in the sensor). This matters because the research I'm starting would hopefully be applicable to the widest range of canon cameras as possible, but the large variations from the analysis above made that seem less likely. I suppose I'll add a third step to this analysis, which will be capturing the same targets with the same 2 cameras at the same times of day, in both raw AND jpg (white balanced)

Thanks again!
