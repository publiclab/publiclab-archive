The Clean Water Act was inflicted in 1972 and has a dramatic part in an area in North Carolina named Camp Lejeune. It was inflicted due to a lawsuit which involved the spilling of toxic chemicals which were drunken by the inhabitants of Camp Lejeune. Studies shown that the water had several cancer-inflicting chemicals which were deemed unsafe for obvious reasons, and the government knew about these toxic chemicals but still allowed people to drink them.
