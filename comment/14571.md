I removed, at the moment, the  camera from the greenhouse. I took thousands of IR photos (every 10 minutes for more then a month) I got a movie ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Gcey4fJz_E ) , but it doesn't have meaning to detect health of plants. Anyway it was great for me because  with your help I learn a lot about Raspberry camera, timelapse, IR and so on.     I hope to find a way to do better and to put again the camera in the greenhouse.
