This is very cool. Chris, any interest in starting a /wiki/skypod page, where we could collect Q&A and such? I was about to ask about the weight but hunted through and found it here: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/03-15-2017/a-standalone-aerial-sensor-pod#c16370

The very minimal template we're working with recently (like the [#nano-data-logger](/tag/nano-data-logger)) has been:

```
Initial few sentences introducing the thing

## Questions

[questions:tagname]

## Activities

[activities:tagname]
```

I put this up in a template you can use here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/new?n=14552
