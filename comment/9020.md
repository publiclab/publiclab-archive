     ...the NIR reflectance of the target affects how much the red/green/blue bayer mosaic filter allows through to the sensor.

Roolark, I would think that the Bayer filter always transmits the same proportion of wavelengths (it's just a filter), but that the sensor may respond differently when impacted with different proportions of NIR and visible light. Does the Bayer filter actually filter differently when there is more or less NIR impacting it?
