Ok, guess having the exposure default to max isn't too bad, but actually setting the exposure to max is better. I've seen evidence that the standard camera app adjusts the exposure when the spectrum intensity gets brighter. It's hard to see or know for sure from just looking, but for a spectrum app, this would be bad.

Worse though is the 'auto focus'. I've tried a few camera apps and searched, but no app allows manual focus. I see glimpses of the camera focusing on the slit, but it doesn't remain focused near there. (This is a common complaint about all android camera apps). If the focus cannot be controlled, then this is a major issue because the change in focus will cause drastic changes in the spectrum curve shape.

It is absolutely necessary to have at least a fixed exposure and fixed focus setting for the spectrum app otherwise, the results will be widely variant so near useless data.
