nbawawa,

Yes there is a lot of potentially confusing information in this research note. The note is about a very special case in which photosynthetic pigments are changing rapidly as leaves senesce in the fall. Leaves change color because there is a shift between pigments absorbing at the blue versus the red end of the spectrum. This situation allows some insight into how consumer cameras work to produce NDVI. And in some cases how they don't work. Sometimes using red visible light to compute NDVI will give the same result as using blue visible light. But sometimes it won't. This is a special case in which it won't. 

This problem exists for both single and dual camera systems. With a dual camera system. you can choose to use either blue or red for visible light, or do both as I did above. With a single camera system that choice has already been made.
