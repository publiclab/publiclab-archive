Hello [@usere6020](/profile/usere6020) - what do your results from NOAA 18 look like? Are you getting clean images from NOAA 18, or are they also noisy?

From the quality of the image you have attached, it looks like WXtoImg is receiving information to decode, but it is not able to distinguish the APT signal clearly enough. Your image looks somewhat like what would happen if WXtoImg were asked to decode white noise on the radio spectrum. Some points to check would be:

- Were you tuned to 137.1000 for NOAA 19? 
- What was your bandwidth? (be sure it is around 40,000 khz)
- Was your dipole pointed in the right direction (see the post below this one by [@zwettstein](/profile/zwettstein) who gives some good tips for using dipole antennas).  

Let us know how you get on!
