Hi, thanks for the tips on IR filter removal on the C270. I thought I'd share my experience...
Firstly, I didn't want to heat mine too much as I feared the failures above may be due to melting the solder on the surface mount components, but ended up leaving mine for 2 minutes approximately 8cm away from a 1kw fan heater.
I then tried to prise the filter off from the corners using a sharp stanley knife blade, but the glue would not give at all. Using more force I then 'successfully' removed the filter in no less than 1000 or so pieces, allowing gravity to let them fall away from the sensor.
I then plugged the camera in and noticed another 1000 or so fragments had stuck to the CCD, along with a couple of big gashes across the image. I attempted to remove these by blowing and using a thin corner of a cigarette paper, but this caused more scratches.
What did work was putting a blob of "lens cleaner" (smells like an ethanol/alcohol substance) straight onto the ccd. Viewing the picture from it I could see the fragments rise in the suspension after a few seconds. I then flicked the blob of alcohol containing the fragments off the CCD by flicking the back of the PCB. I repeated this a few times, and now have a picture with around 20 small fragments and a few gashes of white in various places!
Conclusion: these CCD's may be a lot more sensitive to scratching compared to an SLR sensor which is designed to be cleaned on occasions. In the event of potential shattering of the filter, it may be wise to do this with a vacuum cleaner nozzle mounted very near, so shattering fragments have less chance of ever touching the CCD.
Despite this experience (which, incidentally I did take great care with) I do now have a camera suitable for a spectrometer as enough of my picture is clear(ish) of marks to scan many clean horizontal lines. And I also thoroughly recommend this procedure, maybe trying more heat than I did :-) Have fun, Rob
