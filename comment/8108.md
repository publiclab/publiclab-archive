Great, I have a lot to read !
I have Fiji and the plugin running,,, was able to run the plugin with one picture and with a directory with 2 pictures... but I´m doing something wrong...

I´m not getting nothing similar to the images that you show me... i try choosing red.red and red.blue as visible light and NIR...
I also try making a directory with the 2 images from the 2 cameras, but on the output i get the same process for each file, so its not doing anything between the 2 pictures, just doing the same process for each of them

can you tell me the steps that you follow to process the image that you show me ? Did you use 1 or booth images ?

Thank you!
