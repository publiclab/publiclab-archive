I'm in a situation where the university wont share data with our community group because we are not covered by the University's IRB policy. We want access to the data (and co ownership too). In their contract with the DOJ ( in this case) it states that we have access to the data. If the University doesnt share the data with us, they are in breach of their contract. This obviously was a big oversite on their end. Can we be added the the university IRB after the study has begun? any other suggestions are welcome..
