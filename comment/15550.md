The display uses SPI communication (it has an internal ILI9341 driver). The PIC16F1788 has a hardware SPI module. These type of TFT displays can be picked up for <Â£10 , but they refresh rather slowly due to the slow serial communication, but this is not a problem for this application.
The processor was programmed using GCBasic.
Apart from the programming it's fairly straightforward stuff. Bulb - slit - followed by a lens placed at 1 focal length should give a parallel beam then through the cuvette and onto the diffraction grating. Then a lens to focus the beam onto the diode array (approx 1 focal length between lens and diode array).
Getting the SD card to work was really difficult as there is little (and conflicting) information on the internet.
