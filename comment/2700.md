Alex - That's an good point that some smart phones do HDR. To improve the chances of great results, users of the smart phone spectrometer could take multiple exposures of each sample. This might require using a "tripod" or something to ensure that the camera does not move between exposures.  I guess you are correct that HDR is probably not an option for spectrometers that use a webcam.  Instead of making an adjustable slit, I might just make two or three different ones until I figure out which is best.
Jeff -  Does an iOS user need anything special in order to take photos of spectra and upload them to Spectral Workbench? Or are you working on a video feed from iOS phones to Spectral Workbench?
