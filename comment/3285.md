I was amazed to see this problem solved by <a href="http://astro.neutral.org/eq/spec.html">Astronomical Spectroscopy with Modified Webcams </a> (now THAT'S distance spectrometry!) They are using a CCD based webcam with <1 lux sensitivity. I was unable to find any lux ratings on  webcams listed on Alibaba. 
I was just playing around trying to identify streetlamps. What other useful things can be measured at a distance?
