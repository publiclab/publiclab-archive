It's a challenge to match up photos that were not taken from exactly the same place. It really requires that all the photos or the mosaic be georectified first so they are orthophotos. If you have a lot of photos, and they are mostly vertical shots, you could look for the best matching pairs and use Ned's Fiji plugin to align them and make NDVI for an overlapping rectangle for each pair. But you might not get enough overlap for the algorithm to find the alignment matches. If the RGB and NIR photos are not aligned really well, NDVI is computed with values from two different places and the result can be meaningless.

That's why a dual camera rig uses an external timer and CHDK to take two photos (RGB and NIR) at exactly the same time of the same scene. You needed a [Titan 2 IR rig](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/09-04-2014/the-leaffest-line).
