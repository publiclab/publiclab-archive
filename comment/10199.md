Jeff is correct. The video shows Dr Apte's set up for his work in Delhi. I included it as a kind of inspiration for the start of our work and something to aspire to. We still have a lot of work to do to create a solid reference for calibrating the mobile data collected. Apte's auto-rickshaw kit contained thousands of dollars worth of equipment and he did sustained mobile monitoring for 4 months to reach his conclusions.  I think his research demonstrates some best practice for us to follow for mobile sensing.
