Thanks Pat (It's like Deja Vu).

Jeff, I'm not sure I got a notification of your comment. But I might be confused.

There are two very similar plants that form the broad roundy patches in the lawn. We might not be able to distinguish them even if we knew which was which in order to train the classifier (which we don't).  But a classifier should be able to distinguish those clonal, mat-forming plants from the grass (Bermuda grass?) growing on the artificial mounds of topsoil.  But we already know where they are.
