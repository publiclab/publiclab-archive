Hey [@liz](/profile/liz) - from some initial research I found this [application from the USGS](https://mrdata.usgs.gov/mrds/map-graded.html) that has current and historic quarry and mine locations and reports. I will crack the application open a little more tomorrow morning to see if there is an accessible REST end point to access the data to be used outside of the USGS application. Other than location, are there specific elements or attribution that is desired to support the analysis? Time period?
