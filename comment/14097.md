I had to redesign a few aspects of this circuit, so I posted the new design pics. The LED was running too hot, even with the heat sink, so what I did was ran another 9v battery in series with the first one (which I should have done in the first place to increase current.) then upgraded the resistor to a 3W 1k ohm with an inrush current limiting capacitor at the load terminal.

Now she's running right, still a little warm but that's expected, I got her just under peak voltage at: 3.4v with 200Ma continuos for 2 minutes.
