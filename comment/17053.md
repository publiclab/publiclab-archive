Right click -- got it!

I added the corrected version above.

Yes, I think most point and shoot cameras correct for lots of lens artifacts before they save jpegs. DSLRs have a special place in memory for lens profiles, so when you change the lens it can make the corrections for that lens. Point and shoots have only one lens, so the corrections are integrated into the firmware. Digitally correcting for distortion, chromatic aberration, vignetting, and other artifacts is much easier than making perfect lenses. 

If you save the raw image file in a PowerShot, you might get an uncorrected photo, but I'm not sure. Trying to make the corrections manually will probably produce inferior results compared to the integrated lens profiles.

I did not use raw for the test above. I took a jpeg photo (which was corrected by the camera) and then  did a teensy adjustment in the fisheyegl tool which seemed to remove some barrel distortion.
