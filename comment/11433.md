Hi Nirwansyarif,
I am glad to hear that you think you can use this.
You can purchase a WheeStat kit from Public Lab from this web site: http://store.publiclab.org/collections/new-kits/products/wheestat-potentiostat.    The kit comes with everything you need to put together a functioning potentiostat, including two graphite electrodes and a silver/silver chloride reference electrode.  It also comes with the user interface and the source code on a usb drive.
Directions for puttting it together are here: http://publiclab.org/notes/JSummers/08-07-2014/wheestat-kit-assembly
The user's manual is here: http://publiclab.org/wiki/wheestat-user-s-manual.
Please let me know if there is anything you need help with.
Best,
Jack
