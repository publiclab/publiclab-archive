Hi, everyone - thanks for your proposals -- one thing I mentioned in a couple places that I think may be useful --

> I think it would be great to see a few links to different areas of the existing codebase - to give a better sense of where these features and new code segments would be implemented, and how they relate to existing code. What would go into a model, a controller, a view? Are you familiar with the MVC model and how to break up code among these parts?

These are key and useful questions which can help to give better detail to your proposals and help you break up your work into smaller, more easily tested and maintained parts. It's also great for debugging because if each pull request you make does only one thing, it's easier to review and merge in piece by piece, without the worry that changing one function will break or affect another. 

For more on modularity and why it's helpful, check out the piece I wrote on modularity on our software outreach page! https://publiclab.org/software-outreach

Thanks everyone as we approach our Nov 6th deadline!
