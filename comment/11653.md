Mathew:  Why would you doubt the accuracy of a stepped bore?  A reamer will provide very accurate hole size and ball bearings have very accurate dimensions.  The combination of the two make a very accurate orifice.  But I think I like the manual volumetric vacuum pump best of all.  Also, I wonder if there is much variation in the flow restriction from one packing of chemicals in the tube to the next.
