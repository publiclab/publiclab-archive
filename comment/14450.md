You betcha there's research about how mammal grazing and browsing impact carbon and nutrient cycles. A couple of my buddies from graduate school devoted their careers to this question. To defend themselves, deciduous trees and shrubs alter the chemistry of their leaves in response to heavy browsing. This changes how fast the fallen leaves decompose, the rates of soil carbon turnover, and a cascade of plant-soil interactions. 

Here is the abstract of an old article by the thesis committee members of my grad school chums. This paper was part of the first author's PhD.

Here is the abstract of a younger article by my friend Knut who was a graduate student of the second author above. Knut now has his own graduate students working on the same questions in the same department. There is no end in sight.
