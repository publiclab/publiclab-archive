Hi, when we would move the end points in the present Grape system the path will change like `/api/module-name/..` so they can still exist but I think it would be better to redirect them along with documentation and futher try to get rid of them eventually.

I have made some changes regarding implementation based on the amount of work that has already been done in this project. I will try to add more lists of end-points, mock-ups etc soon
