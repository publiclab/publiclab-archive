Hello! Thank you for the feedback!

Yes, there are a few things that could possibly go wrong while running the migrations. While testing on the unstable server, it would be safe to keep a backup of the data from the tables that are being altered. In case a migration does go wrong, we can rollback and restore the original state of the database.

Another way I thought I could test it out was on my local system. I have setup PublicLab with MySQL, so I could try it out locally as well. Is there a possibility of getting anonymised data so that I can try around in my local system?

In case I do complete the project ahead of time, I would like to look into the Performance Improvements milestone ([linked here](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/milestone/26)).  I have looked into a few issues previously and commented on them - I would like to start properly working on them. Apart from that, I would like to help both contributors and mentors by being more active in code reviews and other internal discussions. After contributing to the repository for about a year, I would now like to take a more active role in reviewing and mentorship.

Once again, thank you for the feedback on the proposal!
