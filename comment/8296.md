Hello Chris.
Seems I need to be more precise on my notes, answer to your question.

NIR camera has the block filter removed. 720 and 850 nm filter are glass filter placed on the outside.

The quality of the filters, I trusted what is written on the box, Filters where bought at a proffesional camera shop. cost arround 25 euro 38 us dollar.

The histograms are of the NIR pictures. Made in gimp with no alteration.

I use chdk to get raw images. format DNG. I use ufraw to convert them to tiff. ufraw --out-type=tiff. the result on this page are in jpeg else the picutres will be huge. For future test I will host all my pictures online, if any one else want to play with them. NDVI are created with tiff as input.

I did not know that withe balance will have an effect. Need to look in to that.

Color table is NDVIBlu2Red.lut

I used red channel IR visible.
I used blue channel for IR, I made a mistake and forgot to set to red channnel. I made a test with red channel and there is no visual diffrences in the NDVI image. If you look at the histogram you can see they have the same profile. But for future test I always will use red channel.

I do not know what you mean with: Did you stretch either or both histograms? How much?
I let gimp create the histogram. Only streching I did is make the window a bit larger.

You request: It would be good to see histograms of just a homogeneous area of vegetation.
Will come, just waiting for the same wheater conditions as last time.

Chris any idea if NDVI will work over water. Can I see alge growth. If yes i want to try to see how farm land runoff will affect surrounding water alge content. In holland we always have alge problem in the summer.  Even toxic level where people are not allowed to swim in lakes.
