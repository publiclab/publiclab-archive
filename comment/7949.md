Merry Christmas! - I've been following the original msp430 launchpad based potentiostat you presented
a while back,and now the stellaris based one here.I'm interested in building this and have downloaded
the Wheestat_5 Energia files and GUI you provided on github.I also downloaded the SPI.h library from
the Stellaisiti forum as you instructed.When trying to compile the Energia Wheestat_5 sketch, I got the
following errors:


digi_Pot.ino:18:6:error:"class SPIClass"has no member named 'setModule'
digi_Pot.ino:28:7:error:"class SPIClass"has no member named 'trans2ByteA'

there are 3 more errors that then alternate with 'trans2ByteA' and 'trans2ByteB'

My question is ...what am I missing and/or forgot to do? You'll have to forgive me,(I'm a Hardware guy),and my programming skills are quite rudimentary.Any help and/or insight you could provide 
would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.....Regards   Mark
