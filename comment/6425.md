Hi,

Re a GPS on board with the cameras, I'm trying to understand how one would use that to georeference an image in GIS with good accuracy. I'm used to the traditional GIS georectification method where you have ground control points (at least four, hopefully more) that are in different locations on the image. 
So how would the GPS on the side work? I guess it would be associated with the pixel in the center of the image?
