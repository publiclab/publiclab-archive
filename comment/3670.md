Oh that's right, the photos have to come back from the cameras into the USB ports so it would be hard to share one port.

Shutter sync won't be that important for ground based plant cam uses, but aerial work usually requires pretty good sync.  <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/4-14-2012/good-shutter-synchronization">This note</a> has a link to a nice timer with a big 1/100 second display which is great for documenting the sync you are getting. Unfortunately the timer is Windows only.

That's nuts that the Pi operating system inhabits only 2 GB.
