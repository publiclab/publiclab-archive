Hi Mark, 
Sorry, but I forgot to mention the issues with the SPI library.  It turns out that the SPI library that came with Energia did not initialize SPI module 0 correctly, and once that was fixed it still required some modification to communicate with the digital potentiometer I used.  
You can get SPI0 to initialize by replacing the SPI library with one found here; http://forum.stellarisiti.com/topic/675-solved%C2%A0launchpad-stellaris-on-energia-miso-erratic-behaviour-on-spi0-and-spi3/.  Look for the zip file in a July 8, 2013 posting by Rei Villo (This issue may be fixed in more recent versions of Energia, so you may not need the new library, I don't know).  I unzipped the file to the libraries file for the Stellaris (for me that is at C:/program files/ energia 0101E0010/ hardware / lm4f / libraries).  I then changed the name on the original SPI library and re-named the new library "SPI".  That got the SPI0 module functioning, but I still had problems getting the digital potentiometer to work. I believe the problem was related to the pot requiring a 16 bit command and the commands in the SPI library only transferring 8 bits.   This means that the CS signal needs to stay low for the 16 bit transfer.    It turns out that I also had a hardware problem that complicated diagnostics.  Anyway, once you are able to get SPI0 working, you still need to add the following definitions for trans2ByteA and trans2ByteB to your SPI library.  

            uint8_t SPIClass::trans2ByteA(uint8_t data) {
                  return transfer(slaveSelect, data, SPI_CONTINUE); }
            uint8_t SPIClass::trans2ByteB(uint8_t data) {
                  return transfer(slaveSelect, data, SPI_LAST); }
 
trans2ByteA pulls the chip select pin low, transmits the first 8 bits and leaves chip select low.  trans2ByteB assumes that chip select is low to start with, transmits the second 8 bits and pulls chip select high, finishing the 16 bit  transfer.  There is kind of an odd delay between the two 8 bit bytes, but the potentiometer seems to work fine.  My struggles with this are described in a little greater detail at http://forum.stellarisiti.com/topic/1719-spi-with-16-bit-data/.  
Try that and let me know if it works.  If that does not work, let me know what you see and I will try to help.
Best, Jack
