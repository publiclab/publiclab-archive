Hi Stevie...I'm no expert in this area but in my surfing I happened across a few links on this topic recently. Hopefully these will be of some use to you, and get you off in the right direction:

Analog: https://www.instructables.com/id/PLASTIC-BOTTLE-RAIN-GAUGE/

Several digital options:

https://www.mysensors.org/build/rain

http://cactus.io/projects/weather/arduino-weather-station-rain-sensor

https://www.creatroninc.com/product/water-rain-sensor/?search_query=rain&results=53

Good luck!
