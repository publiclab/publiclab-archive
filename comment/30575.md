Going back over this.  We did a lot of work with total organic carbon (TOC).  According to Dr. Paul Whitehead at egalabwater.com (the blog title is "let's talk about lab water" and the specific article is "TOC and it's measurement" ), TOC equals DOC plus NDOC(non-dissolved organic carbon).  There are a number of other interesting things there, too.   So the base instrument is a TOC. With the  TOC instrument we used, reagents could be required, depending on purity of the water.  Dirty water would need reagents.  Relatively clean water, probably not.  At the time, the instrument was relatively expensive (about $20k with autosampler). Hopefully, the price has dropped.  Calibration and reagent changing was also moderately expensive.
