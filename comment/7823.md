I think there are some apps which allow long exposures ([Camera FV-5](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flavionet.android.camera.pro&hl=en)).  I guess the calibration photo of the paint would have to use the same settings (e.g., ISO, white balance) as the photo you want to calibrate, because those settings will influence color representation. That might be possible in some situations but not in others. But maybe to calibrate two cameras with each other that is not critical, especially if the color representation of the two cameras vary due to settings in the same way. But if they vary in the same way, maybe they don't need to be calibrated?
