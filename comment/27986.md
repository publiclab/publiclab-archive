Very good work.

Another possible demonstration.  I worked for a pharmaceutical company.  We would check the incoming stoppers to see if they had been chlorinated ( to reduce friction) by taking a clean piece of copper wire, heating it over a Bunsen burner until the flame was clean (mostly yellow), rubbing a stopper on the hot wire, and then putting the site either under the burner (in the air intake) or in the flame.  If chlorine is present, you should see a green flame.  This went down to relatively low levels of coordination ( under 100 ppm).  Don't know if these stoppers are still used, but you might try it on chlorinated stoppers, as well as chlorobutyl  based stoppers, just to see how it works.  It will take several tries to find the green flame you are looking for.
