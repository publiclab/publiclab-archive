Ned,

So the displayed graphs with two points are not meaningless (I found them to be helpful), but the RÂ² values are not useful because they are always equal to 1.00.

With three or more data points, have you found any indication that the relationship is curvilinear? Would a curvilinear regression improve some calibrations? Would it help with the gamma problem?
