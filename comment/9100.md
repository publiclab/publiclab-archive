Sir, this is very nice tool. I used it with some raw images I took a few years back. I can understand better what I am looking at, grass, sky, trees and tell the difference in NDVI. What I do not know is how to interpret the information. What is healthy? What is not? Is that range of 0.1 - .1 healthy?
