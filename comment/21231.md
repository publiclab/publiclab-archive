The field evaluation report linked above includes 78 graphs comparing the results of a Purple Air sensor with a $25k GRIMM optical particle counter. Every one of those graphs indicates that the Purple Air sensor produces a higher reading than the GRIMM reference sensor. A example is below. Fortunately, the regression equations for each comparison are presented, so these can be used to adjust the readings of a Purple Air sensor to more accurate values.
