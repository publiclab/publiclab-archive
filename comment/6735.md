kykytos, This is a really good question. Lots of blue light can pass through a [#2007](/n/2007) filter, so a white light viewed through the filter will appear blue. Red light is absorbed by the filter material, and that light turns to heat. The filter has a shiny surface, so all colors are reflected off of it. If you hold a piece of the blue filter under a light, but with a very dark area behind the filter, the filter does not look very blue. Even red is reflected off the surface. Some of the blue light that enters the filter material is reflected and scattered on the inside of the material, and some of that can come back to you when you look at the filter. Red light that enters the filter material does not come back to you because the filter material absorbs it. So the filter can look slightly blue even when no light is being transmitted to you from the other side.
