Hi, Cheryl -- there's a little bit about cell-enabled trail cameras for remote [#timelapse](/tag/timelapse) monitoring, here: https://publiclab.org/notes/LauraChipley/09-18-2015/hacking-trail-cameras-to-document-blasts-on-mountaintop-removal-sites

Though that costs a bit more -- $230 i think, plus the cell plan. 

I also think there've been some efforts to use [#raspberry-pi](/tag/raspberry-pi) cameras to do lower-cost versions, although they'd need a wifi or cell connection to do live monitoring.
