Maria, a couple of pointers: 

First, [this is a knowledge base of tech tools](https://airtable.com/shr1vjNbKJK8NpWBV), assembled a few years ago by some of the folks who participated in the Barnraising that Stevie mentioned.

Second, [here's a draft of principles for disaster response](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XC8c_RTFb_A-DapN7TIkJCg8XSgI9G3iUYh3dIYx5tA/edit#) that may be worth keeping in mind in conversation with others about your challenges and decisions.

Let me know if you have other questions, I'd be glad to help if I can!
