That one is really contrasty. I guess some experiments are in order to see how various white balance settings work and how the other photo settings help. I set the "Exposure" a third of the way toward "Dark," and increased the "Contrast" a little. So there are lots of variables to be fine tuned. I guess I would try a lower blue setting next. But that's kind of a nice IR photo.
