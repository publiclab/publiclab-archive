Should consideration be made for naming an ecothermic animal as mascot of Public Lab, one might need to examine the educational consequences of presenting said cold-blooded creature wearing an insulating sweater which could have physiological effects quite different from those experienced by you or me when donning a similar garment. Do tell, does a sweater keep a turtle warm or cold?
