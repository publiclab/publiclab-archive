Having built the DSSK 3 and experiencing utter frustration with it the minimum for me is the wood platform as per the upgrades with additional modifications. I am now on build 3 awaiting arrival of a different camera with known bandwidth. I have discarded the oragami box, added an additional piece  at the rear to form a box shape 1.5 x 2 used a piece of heavy (100 lb) paper as the light tight enclosure with black electrical tape, extended the front of base by about 2 in to serve as a platform for cuvette holder. SW should be capable of better use of the current camera's resolution. ie 1024 samples viz 640 or better. Don't have pix of the device.
