Thanks! I'm using a Canon PowerShot A490. I'm not sure about the custom white balance presets, but I can ask the person who worked on the camera. The camera has the Rosco [#2007](/n/2007) filter. 

It was sunny outside, but I was around some shade from trees. The only post-processing completed was reducing the image size. 

Here's the link to my results of the image I posted: http://infrapix.pvos.org/show/figs_faraway_small.jpg

I also tested a closeup image: http://infrapix.pvos.org/show/figs_closeup_small.jpg
