[@warren](/profile/warren), I definitely agree that the idea of a centralized committee would be at odds with democratization of science.  I was envisioning something more along the lines of a team of significant contributors carrying out specific tests, sort of like the beta testing program fro the Oil Testing Kit, not a hierarchical body of self-proclaimed experts.   

Yes, yes, yes to developing a scaffolding for transparent norms in assessing the abilities of a tool and technique for various purposes.  I think it will have to be an iterative process, first with testing out the tool itself in controlled circumstances, and then various field scenarios.  I'm also interested in sussing out how to communicate the capabilities and limitations of techniques and tools independently from each other (as independent as possible).
