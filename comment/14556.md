Hi, [@rmeister](/profile/rmeister) - was doing a little more research into this in my spare time, and found a few things -- 

The first was that I used an audio recording program to record the output of an Arduino running the SoftSerial library on a couple pins connected to a headphone jack:

Then I used the free software program [fl-digi](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fldigi/) -- a radio encoding/decoding program -- to look at the spectrum put out by the Arduino:

I guess this was obvious in retrospect -- you can see "bits" if you turn the baud rate down real low, but they're just on or off, not dual-tone like FSK would be. 

On the other hand, if you use fl-digi to record from modem.js, you can see the two distinct frequencies used:

Just thought this might be a good debugging tool for you as you go. 

I also have been using this javascript-based equalizer as a similar sort of "waterfall" interface: https://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/input/
