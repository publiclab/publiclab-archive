This is awesome!  I haven't the time to rig up all this with the baby and am jealous of the data you can collect, but we use a non-electric fan on our wood stove.  Minimum temp is 122F/50C and the speed is proportional to the temp.  I didn't know they could be had for $40!  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018G9ZKBK/ref=asc_df_B018G9ZKBK5319609/?tag=hyprod-20&creative=395033&creativeASIN=B018G9ZKBK&linkCode=df0&hvadid=194003459169&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4357379295133181127&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9006808&hvtargid=pla-310730434040
