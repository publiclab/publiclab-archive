Biome- is a major community that consist of plants and animals with similar life forms. Ecosystem- is an area where plants, animals and other organisms interact. 7,969,432,300 is the current world population. 779,719,407 is the amount of people who has no access to a safe drinking water source. The 4 spheres are atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere. Atmosphere has something to do with air. Hydrosphere has something to do with water. Biosphere has something to do with life. Geosphere has something to do with Earth. 71 % of Earth's surface is covered by water. 3 % of the water is fresh and the other percentage is salt water. The number of deaths caused by water related diseases this year is 540,446.I see water and mountains which are abiotic. Lion and a horse which are biotic. 21 % is made up of oxygen. Biomes are very important because not every organisms can adapt to certain climates. Each organism has their own biome that they adapt too.
