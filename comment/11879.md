Looks like you had problems breaking the tip of the tube.  What process did you use?

I am really curious to find out how much flow variation there is between formaldehyde tubes.  Breaking the tube in different places on the taper will vary the restriction.  I have only observed 2 measurements so far so my sample size is small.  I believe that the flow rate changed over the first minute or so and then became stable.  I could propose that the chemical reactions in the tube caused this variation or some settling of the packing material is occurring.

A pipette might provide a more accurate bubble measuring setup.  It has an opening in both ends, is available in multiple volumes, and is available cheaply as a disposable item.
