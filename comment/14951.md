The print looks really good. There is plenty of room for the nuts. There are a few details that could be adjusted:

-  I mentioned the leg holes should be a deep as possible
- . The set screws are at the proper angle, but are not aimed at the center of the tube. The screws will hold the tubing best if the holes are along the blue line below.

 - If the bulge was even bulgier on the sides like the blue lines below I think the added strength would be appreciable.

 - The indents on the back are not big enough. They probably should be about as big as you had them the first time. Maybe they should be angled like the red line below so the wall of the tube does not get so thin. Maybe the red line should be at an even steeper angle (more vertical).

I watched a bunch of Fusion 360 videos but I'm still useless getting anything done on a model. That might be the steepest learning curve I have encountered in software.
