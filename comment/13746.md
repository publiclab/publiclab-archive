RIght, Jeff, those are good questions and I'm not a Chemist -- I'm just extracting from what I glean from the web. But I think it would be good to find some good technical discussion about the multi-spectral issue so as to place some bounds on the issue; if it's significant. Some of this comes from descriptions of commercial devices -- i.e., if someone builds hardware, they must have a reason. There appeared to be a limited number od stimulation wavelengths but I'd guess that has more to do with what sources are available, not that there are necessarily any "special" excitation wavelengths (tough some may be better than others).
