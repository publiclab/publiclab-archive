So this camera has a red filter and captures NIR in the blue channel.

The standard interpretation of NDVI values assumes that the photos were taken with the plant foliage illuminated by sunlight. If your plants are illuminated with artificial lights or sunlight filtered through modern windows, the ratio of NIR to visible light could differ enough to make NDVI meaningless.

>  would you consider calculating the NDVI from the red and nir channel okay?

Yes, NDVI = (NIR-R)/(NIR+R) is the standard way to compute NDVI. Both the red and green channels will be contaminated with NIR. If there is data on which channel is less contaminated, that might support using a different formula.

>  the red channel pixel intensity seems very high compared to the blue one (which is very sparse). Should I be concerned about not capturing enough NIR?

Yes, you should be concerned. Consumer digital cameras are not very sensitive to NIR and the ratio of Red:NIR in the photo will generally not be anywhere close to the Red:NIR ratio in the photographed scene.

Mapir supplies a calibration target, calibration software, and instructions for how to use them. This calibration procedure or some other procedure must be followed to produce NDVI images that might have biological meaning. The primary adjustment made by the calibration procedure is to exaggerate the intensity of the NIR channel. Some calibration procedures might also reduce the intensity of the visible channel to compensate for the contamination of that channel with NIR.
