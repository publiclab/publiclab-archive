Hi [@ranavivek_me19](/profile/ranavivek_me19), thank you for your proposal! I'll leave a few comments I hope are helpful feedback.

The hashtags idea is interesting - can you tell a little bit more about what goals the feature will help achieve? Do you see it as being useful for assessing if content is spammy, or is it more like a way to aggregate similar authors by topic?

I like how you've highlighted the comments on different maps. It does seem that the comment display should be moved from the editor page to the view page, and I think it's the way it is now because we didn't used to have 2 separate pages. This can simplify the editor page and make it easier to see where to comment as well. 

I appreciate the email system you're imagining but I am not convinced if we need email notifications. Are the emails for the map authors, or for the admins who are doing the banning? What are the pros/cons of email notifications for each?

I also like the visual mockups of how the error messages will look. Be sure to keep in mind the Bootstrap UI library for consistency as this helps us keep complexity low!

Thanks so much again, we appreciate your application!
