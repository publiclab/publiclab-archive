Hi [@seankmcginnis](/profile/seankmcginnis), would you be available sometime to talk about your work with Public Lab Philadelphia? I'm working with CMU Libraries in Pittsburgh and am interested in reproducing or linking up with some of your group's activities. 

(Sorry for the unconventional method of contact - I wasn't able to find a direct messaging option on the Public Lab platform.)

Hope to talk soon, Patrick
