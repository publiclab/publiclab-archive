Hi, this looks like a bug -- I've opened a new bug report here: https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/issues/386

I saw an error while forking it, and -- I think it's related to the issue you're seeing. 

It's odd - i think there's another bug causing this, but although I saw the same error message as you when I calibrated the fork I made, when I reloaded that page, it had in fact saved:

https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/92538

For the time being you can use that as a calibration source!
