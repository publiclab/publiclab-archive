kykytos, you are correct. The equation `(NIR-R)/(NIR+R)` is the standard one for NDVI. Substituting blue for red as in `(NIR-B)/(NIR+B)` also works well, because both blue and red are absorbed by plants for photosynthesis. The NGB (NIR, Green, Blue) photos from an infrablue camera do not have a visible red light channel because NIR is captured in the red channel, so blue is used instead to compute NDVI.
