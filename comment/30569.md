Danger: 16.1%
          With the biosphere dependent on biotic and abiotic organisms that provide them with energy and nutrients, The biosphere becomes a narrow zone on the surface of the earth where soil, water, and air combine to sustain life. So, what happens when the soil, water, and air are at risk? The amount of chemicals, waste, and power plants have put Baton Rouge in danger. When atmosphere-biosphere interactions influence the health of the air we breathe rough surfaces of vegetation remove aerosols, ozone, and other reactive gases from the air through dry deposition, it causes your health to be at risk. In the time between 2014 to 2015 the air quality easily became more dangerous. In that short amount of time the air quality went from 3.20% to 16.10%. Baton Rouge known being “Cancer Alley,” has toxic air pollutants/air toxics known or suspected of causing cancer or other serious health problems, such as birth defects. The atmosphere in St. Gabriel is in danger. The advocate says the plant in St. Gabriel Clear Air Act. Even though it's an outdated chart there is 51.8% moderate air quality 32.3% is good and 16.1% of the air quality is unhealthy for sensitive group. Exposure to radon in the home is responsible for an estimated 20,000 lung cancer deaths each year. Radon is a health hazard with a simple solution. 
          The biosphere is an important part of the water cycle because it is where all the spheres interact and work together. The hydrosphere is very moderate to dangerous. From the website you can see how there are various of dumping sites by the rivers and lakes. When the water in our rivers, lakes, and oceans becomes polluted; it can endanger wildlife, make our drinking water unsafe, and threaten the waters where we swim and fish. The EPA Region 6 Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act (CWPPRA) program team works with federal, state, and local partners to develop, design, and build Louisiana coastal restoration projects. Repairing the area’s natural hydrology improved the health of existing trees by providing needed periods of flooding and drying.  Due to all the pollution, the CWA (Clean Water Act) has aided to keep the pollution out the rivers and other waters to meet the clean water goal for our health, safety, and even the wildlife. Considering life exists on the ground, in the air, and in the water, the biosphere overlaps all the spheres.
