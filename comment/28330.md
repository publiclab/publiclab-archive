[@dianapicaszo2104](/profile/dianapicaszo2104) oh no! I'm sorry to hear you're having technology glitches. Is this question specific to an activity you're doing, or as part of a recent Public Lab workshop?

I just want to make sure I can get you to someone that could help. Let us know a bit more information, and I will ping additional staff support. Thank you!

Also, Public Lab offers [drop-in] Open Calls every week on Tuesdays! If you feel you'd like to get help with someone via Zoom for your question, here's more on how to join those: https://publiclab.org/wiki/open-call
