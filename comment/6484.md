> users would naturally just pick the middle

I guess I'm suggesting that with a 50/0/50 attenuator, although users may pick the middle naturally (as will the current auto-detection algorithm which -- for uploads -- picks the brightest row), we could put in a filter which autodetects clipping and either a) suggests to the user that they pick a different line (at capture time or in post-processing) or automatically scans the source image for data which is not clipped (which could also happen at capture time or analysis time). What about something like that?
