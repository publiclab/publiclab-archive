Update:  Received word back from the Kitagawa company.  Unfortunately, they were of no help, simply saying that "...tube 710 is designed for monitoring formaldehyde, and it is quite difficult to provide the sensitivity rate against other aldehydes and/or acetone.  There may be some influence by the other aldehydes, however, the level of influence is different with tube lot and concentration level.  Anyway, especially In case of mixture of similar gases like this case, a detector tube system may not be feasible, unfortunately." Interestingly, this is a tube used to measure formaldehyde in occupational settings, which are probably the most likely to have significant co-contaminant loads...
