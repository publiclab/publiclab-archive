Amy, have you tried shining a laser through those? I had the odd experience today of finding a fish oil pill, and look what happens when you shine a UV laser through it! Very reminiscent of this poster, but could also be Vitamin E or A, according to them: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/11-25-2013/poster-on-issues-with-pah-detection-in-fish
