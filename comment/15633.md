I'd guess that it's just the collection and comparison of key measurements extracted from the spectra which may result in 'sensitivity' estimates. So, adding a summary of observations to the end of this post seems appropriate. Date which shows estimates of peak wavelength stability after cal would make for good comparison; eg: Post-Cal wavelength repeatability: 546+/-2nm (normal handling), 546+/-5nm  (1 meter drop stress test).
