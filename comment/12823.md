That seems reasonable.  I don't know whether the gel-ceramic junction will be an issue or not.  My guess is that it will not be a problem.  If it is, you could try layering the gel on top of an aqueous layer that is in contact with the ceramic.  Right now I am working on another note about reference electrodes.  It is about replacing the rubber septum at the top with materials that will not break down like rubber does.  It should be out in less than an hour. --Jack
