[@pera](/profile/pera) THANK YOU! That would be ideal! (Also, I'd LOVE to join the DC Women and Bicycles forum anyway!) I would love for you to share the information! This may be a little confusing, but can you put my work contact on your email out -- caroline.howe AT udc.edu -- but add me to the DC women & bikes forum with personal email -- carolinelhowe AT gmail.com ? Thanks so much, this is fantastic!
