Fantastic work. This is a seriously cool project. I'm going to fiddle with my design for a telescope eyepiece phone mount http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39144 . It's in two pieces (a phone case and a short barrel to slide over the eyepiece) that fit together with 2 formed pins. It may not be such a stretch to design the spectrometer tube to fit to the existing case.
