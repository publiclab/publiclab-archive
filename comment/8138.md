great work... I am also thinking about building a spectrometer with linear ccd... however I scavenged the ccd from an old scanner and donot know anything about its pinout to interface with a pc... initial thoughts are to solve out the pinout and use an Arduino to interface with this ccd... I do not plan to invest anything into this as a "DIYer" and willing to find a way to get this thing work... there is a small mirror in front of the ccd inside the scanner which is already placed 45deg in front of it, I can mount a blank dvd piece as the grater as usual and test it like that if I can capture a single line with it... any help from you experienced makers is highly appreciated...
