it's a photo of water (near a marina) with motor oil in it; then i took a digital camera, removed the hot mirror filter which usually removes all infrared light, and added a filter to remove all visible light. The result is a camera which takes pictures only in the 800-1200 nanometer wavelengths.

unfortunately, it does not highlight motor oil. I don't know if it'd work for crude, but i suspect we need an image closer to 2500 nm.
