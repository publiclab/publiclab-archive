Can you specify the type?

By the way - it is not rocket surgery to calibrate a refractometer.
Most beekeepers do it by himself. You just need distilled water and a sample solution with known sugar content (e.g. 50%), a dropping glass and a small screwdriver.

Howto:
Clean and dry it carefully.
Apply 1-2 drops of distilled water on the prism.
The line of light-dark transition should be at 0%, if not use the calibration screw until it matches (often under a small rubber cap).
Check with known sugar content solution in pure and diluted form.
Done. :)
