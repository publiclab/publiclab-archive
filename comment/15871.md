That's great, Will - thanks! From the "types" listed above, was there a group you'd be interested in joining? I can add you to the project as appropriate if that's helpful. 

But also, if you want to do some mapping stuff, there's one issue here which I was hoping to reformat into a `first-timers` issue, and I could do that soonish if you'd like to tackle it?

It's small, but it's an important step forward!
