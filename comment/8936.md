Very nice work. I checked the listing for the lamp, and if you are using the original bulb, it is a "warm white" with color temperature of 2700 degrees. LED lamps come in a variety of shades, which depend on the choice of phosphors and the bulb design. In the "warm white" bulbs, the blue peak at about 450 nanometers is reduced, as shown at http://led-brdf.wikispaces.com/file/view/WarmWhite_Spectral_Response.PNG/243418117/WarmWhite_Spectral_Response.PNG 
A more standard white LED with a higher color temperature has a much sharper peak at 450 nm as shown at http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:White_LED.png ,
