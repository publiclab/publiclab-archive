Chris,
I also noticed the 405nm line was all but absent in your spectrum, and that is one reason I brought up my previous experience.  I came across that data recently, but now I cannot find the file where I recorded it.  What dropped out for me were some of the red lines, but in some recent configuration studies I saw the 405 line go away.  In that case I was using the reflective part of the dvd (when you split the dvd one piece is reflective and the other has no reflector on it but they both have grooves).  I am really not sure what is going on here.  In the experiments with my DSLR in 2008 my best recollection is that it had to do with  whether the slit was illuminated by the light bulb straight on or somewhat at an angle.  You might want to play with the illumination angle and see what happens.

Thanks for the info on the overlay.
