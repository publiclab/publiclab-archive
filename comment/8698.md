Yeah!  It's fun to picture this device being used in the mode of an old-fashioned 'light meter' held next to an infragram camera and which accounts for ambient light conditions somehow.  Maybe the OpenLux could display (on the Nokia) or record (we can add a uSD card, or have it connected to a laptop) the brightness values (lux?) for R,G,B, and NIR for a scene, and one then uses those values on infragram.org to automatically adjust the levels on the associated infragram image? 

I wonder if we can use one half of a ping pong ball, taped on top of the photodiodes, as a diffuser ... but then we'd need to worry about variations in ping pong ball material ... maybe there's some Rosco or Wratten filter that could be used as a diffuser, or some other widely-available, consistently produced material ...
