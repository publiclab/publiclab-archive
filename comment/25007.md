Hi, thanks for posting your question. There are some answers here: https://publiclab.org/questions/cedarlodge/02-27-2018/uploading-images-from-raspberry-pi

And our new Spectral Workbench Capture project is trying to address this question this summer in https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/issues/56 -- which I believe [@jenjimah](/profile/jenjimah) is helping out with?

Thanks!
