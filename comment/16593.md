[@nedhorning](/profile/nedhorning) I have been looking to carry out calibration but was halted by the expensive costs of targets. After reading through your article, I really want to give these targets a try. I would be very thankful if you could share the spectral reflectance data of the targets chosen, as the image above isn't very clear. Thank you.
