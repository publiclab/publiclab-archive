Have you considered a small spinning wheel? a sensor could be used to sync holes in the wheel with the camera shutter, and it could easily run up to full frame rate. If the filter covered most of half of the wheel there would probably be little need for sync and a few bad frames could be tossed out. A servo motor system from a cd player or disc drive could probably work.

How many software engineers does it take to change a light bulb? None. It's a hardware problem. I have great respect for the engineers who developed the parallax software, as it was necessary. Software can often accomplish tasks that can be extremely difficult or impossible to accomplish with hardware. There is no point in making the software work too hard when the hardware should be pulling its weight too.
