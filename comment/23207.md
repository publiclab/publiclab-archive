I'd be happy to help.  Give me some time to look it over.

I've worked extensively with EDXRF, but mostly the desktop (read R&D) variety.  Only a little with the handheld units.  Did a lot of AA work.  Again, only a minor amount of ICP.  

Did a lot of the USP tests for lead and heavy metals, but those often use hydrogen sulfide or other not so nice reagents.
