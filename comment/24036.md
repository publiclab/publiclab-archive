 These are really good questions.

1) Calibration -
Calibration typically involves placing known reference samples in the scene, check out https://publiclab.org/tag/ndvi-calibrate, in particular [@nedhorning](/profile/nedhorning) 

2) Image stitching-
Image stitching can be done manually using Public labâ€™s Mapknitter https://mapknitter.org/  	(you can stitch images even if they are not  taken from above) or as  
[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) noticed, the free Microsoft ICE(Windows only) will stitch photos into a single image and blend them together. 

3) Processing NDVI-
Another tool besides infragram is image sequencer , https://sequencer.publiclab.org/examples/#steps= . Image sequencer has more colormaps and histogram correction which also may prove useful.

You could also work processing direct on the  Raspberry Pi .  This is typically done with python applications.   See  [@petter_mansson1](/profile/petter_mansson1)     https://github.com/PiddePannkauga/ndviMachine code or my own code https://github.com/MargaretAN9/Peggy/blob/master/README.md (see examples at https://publiclab.org/profile/MaggPi )
