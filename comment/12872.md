It's been on my to-do list for ages, but I finally got around to posting the build tutorials for the basic 3 component data logger based on Promini sized Arduino's:

[Build Instructions - Part 1](http://wp.me/p4iseb-1uG) - component preparation

[Build Instructions - Part 2](http://wp.me/p4iseb-1v7)  - logger platform assembly

[Build Instructions - Part 3](http://wp.me/p4iseb-1vr)   - sensors & housing

[Build Instructions - Part 4](http://wp.me/p4iseb-1xk)  - power optimization

That last part on power optimization might be a bit tricky for people just starting out with Arduinos, so I would build the basic three component logger first, just to get the hang of it, before moving on to the advanced build. Hope that helps a few of the people who were interested.
