Thanks for your work on the plugin Ned. I've been experimenting with it to create an NDVI mosaic from 148 aerial images taken with a custom dual-camera setup. My first attempt was to create the NDVI image for each image pair, and then stitch the NDVI images into a mosaic. That didn't work very well because the stitching software (Autopano Giga) seemed to be put off by slightly different NDVI values for the same scene across multiple images. Lately though I've tried creating a mosaic for RGB, and a mosaic for NIR, and then using your plugin to create an NDVI image from the two. That worked a lot better, though the black around the edges of the mosaic created an unexpected effect of a pink hash pattern in the NDVI image.

I'm wondering whether the black edges also confuse the affine transformation in bUnwarpJ. Do you think I should replace the black with a more neutral colour before feeding it into the plugin?

Here's my log.txt:
PARAMETER SETTINGS:
Use backup registration method if primary fails? true

Method to improve SIFT point selection: none
Select index type for calculation: NDVI: (NIR-Vis)/(NIR+Vis)

Output NRG image? false
