I imagine so (regarding the grass).  If it's fairly fresh, there's probably enough water content to feed the bacteria as things break down.

We use pine shavings for our chicken house, and between the chicken manure and the hay that they keep kicking out of the nest boxes, it seems to be a fairly good mix.  Most of our kitchen refuse goes to the chickens, so I guess that means we are using kitchen refuse via the long way.

The bulk is mostly the horse and goat barn manure, mixed with whatever hay they stomp into it during the winter feedings.  When you get down to it, that's just processed grass, for the most part--the animals have just pulled out a lot of the good stuff and concentrated it for us.

Now I'm starting to wonder what other technologies and techniques we can use from Public Lab.  Putting a little open source science into composting might help some groups in the world that have a supply of (figurative or literal) crap and need somewhere to start turning it back into food.

* Riffle for logging/monitoring
* DIY spectrometry to follow composition changes
* Temperature-appropriate cultures?
* Quantitative analysis techniques?
