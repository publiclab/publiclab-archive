Actually, it seems to be possible to remove the filter coating (which should only be a few microns thick) on the new versions.  After removing the outer housing and the lens, I saw a monolithic sensor â€“ no removable filter, but obviously reflecting reddish light.  I sanded the sensor using ultra fine sandpaper (2000+ grit) until the reflective color looked much less reddish (though this could have just been my imagination).  Then I used some Novus plastic scratch remover and polisher on the sensor.  Finally, I cleaned everything up with isopropyl alcohol and let it dry.  The camera now seems to be able to detect IR light.
