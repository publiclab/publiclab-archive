OK -- a few thoughts -- I'm taking multiple spectra at each step, and tagging all with "stability-upgrade": https://spectralworkbench.org/tags/stability-upgrade

I'm taking two pre-smush with a [stability-upgraded spectrometer](https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/09-16-2016/stability-upgrade-mockup-for-plab-spectrometer-3-0) without moving it in the "test stand" and two after removing it and replacing it in the test stand. We'll do the same with an un-reinforced spectrometer. 

Where and how should I post the results of these tests? I guess here... or on the stability upgrade post itself?
