Great. I've ordered the last two as they have the accuracy we need--will report back by the end of the week. way cheaper than the one i had found. 

Sticky tape should be fine as we won't be pulling air through the tube when its on the card. it would take hours or maybe days for the formaldehyde to passively get into the tube. In an early iteration with a toluene tube i had some tape in the air intake system which yielded wildly high results but as long as we're not sucking exposed glue directly into the tube we should be in the clear.
