You can simplify this by using a single lens instead of the scope.  Attach something white to either side of the slit and then focus the object you want to examine on that white background near the slit(or temporarily cover the slit with a piece of paper while focusing).  The smaller the <em>f </em>number of the lens the brighter your image will be.  To start, it would be best to focus a light bulb on the slit.  You can start with just a magnifying glass if you like.  This is likely to give you much greater intensity on the slit than the rifle scope and is cheaper to boot.  If you are satisfied with the result, then substitute a lens that is corrected for chromatic aberration (an achromat) for the magnifier.  If you have a lens from a single lens reflex camera around that would be great.
