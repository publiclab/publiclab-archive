tail correction can work a bit but it isn't the best for stability, because the amount of drag the tail adds will change with the wind.

the leading edge spar pockets are a little loose to allow removal of the spars, and this can lead to leaning in the kite, because the spars aren't always positioned evenly. I suggest pushing the two leading edge spars all the way up towards the front of the kite before attaching the spreader.  The spreader will hold the leading edge spars in place.
