Hi guys, if you know Apache works well and meets your needs, it's fine with me! What does it take to use it? Can you send us all a link to join a call, or do we have to individually install something on our computers? If someone wants to take the lead on this in the next half hour, please do, otherwise we'll use the zoom link that (I think) I already sent out.
