This is a cool idea esp. the site-planning with "buildings" or air barriers. I heard a good comment about this on Instagram too, where i'd posted -- about using some flat partitions of clear material (acrylic) so you can see through them but the fog is blocked.

[@crispinpierce](/profile/crispinpierce) [@OrionAllgaier](/profile/OrionAllgaier) can you see this being useful to people planning sensor placement in Wisconsin? 

I should run these on batteries too so the cables don't make the model too tangled.
