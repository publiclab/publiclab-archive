It's true that the PL spec was not designed for many simultaneous spectra, but if you look at some of the posts on [#hyperspectral](/tag/hyperspectral) imaging, a slit does actually return a series of spectra that can be resolved into images. I think the angle would be measurable, but am not sure how any scattering could be assessed.
