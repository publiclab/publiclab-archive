Thank you very much for your quick and informative answer, Mr. Chris. Among those choices, which one do you suggest? To me, [#4](/n/4) looks ideal (light cannot pass near the filter, if properly mounter it wont bend etc.) and easy to perform. Is there a special kind of glue? Do you have any kind of warnings, advises etc? (I've read the instructions like this one, but any feedback is welcomed)  Thanks again,
