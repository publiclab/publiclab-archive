1)  The bag will not inflate if the valve is completely closed
2)  The nut is reusable, and the ferrule is too if you're careful (you can tighten it slightly, enough to hold it in place, but not so tightly that you can't slide the Tedlar bag in and out).  You sort of need to have a light touch to do this -- if you accidentally overtighten it it's not a problem, you just have to cut the ferrule off before you send it in.  If it's overtightened, you can still use the bag, but you can't reuse the ferrule.
3)  It should be set to deflate, since you're trying to suck air out of the container (in order to get the bag to inflate). That said, f you're not sure which way the pump is working and want to do a trial run, you can also rubber band a regular old plastic bag to the utake port - make sure there's a clear path for air to get in - and run the pump to see if you have it set up right.  That way you can test proof of concept without having to use an entire Tedlar bag.

Hope that helps!
