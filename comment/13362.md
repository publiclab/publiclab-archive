It does come with the holder, and I've been playing a bit with the tripod socket and finding ways to use it without throwing the balance out. 

I agree this version is too short to self level, but with addition of a little length it acts much better:

I went ahead and strung this rig up, using a new idea for attaching to pole kit.
the pole kit now ships with a length of pvc rigid tubing to give more stability, but happy accident, it's just the size to prevent a carabiner from passing on the pole. So simple solution to picavet mount on the pole is to slide the hardware to the down-side, pass biner through the screw hole on that, and click other end above the PVC. Thusly:
