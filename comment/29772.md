The Mississippi river is important to me and other around me for many reasons. Firstly, it is our main source of water for consumption and usage. So if that water were to be pollution, we would be showering in, cleaning with, cooking with, and even directly drinking these many pollutants that can have drastic affects on our health. Secondly, the Mississippi river is a massive source of income for our state. One in 70 jobs in Louisiana is related to the seafood industry, and last year alone seafood has an economic impact of 2.4 Billion dollars. The more our waters become polluted, the less habitable it is for marine life, which has an effect on our jobs and economy.
