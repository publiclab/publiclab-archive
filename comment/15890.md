Many plant species have leaves with broadly similar spectral reflection properties. So depending on the species it might be a challenge to distinguish plant species by the color of the leaves. The difference among species will likely be smaller than the variability due to sun angle, leaf angle, surface moisture, leaf age, and leaf health. 

Leaf shape is a better taxonomic indicator, and there are not many plants with leaves shaped like dandelion leaves. But determining the leaf shape of an individual leaf in a lawn might be very hard if all you have is a digital image. That could be a challenging image analysis task.
