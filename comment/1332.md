Will respond some of the issues I raised in my previous post here in this thread.
Will also look in the wiki if there is a page on this subject and maybe add/centralise the info there.

There are a bunch of posts titled "Spectrometry UROP" which bring some very nice info and I fund this one particularly infomative:

Basically it talks about the UV filtering properties of the polycarbonate layer of the DVD grating, which attenuates or absorbs the UV lines you want to capture. The proposed solution is splitting the DVD's layers at the middle, exposing the metal grating and using it as a grating mirror shining the light reflected into the camera, instead of shining the light through the grating into the camera.

Crucial is also the removal of any UV filter present in the camera optics.
