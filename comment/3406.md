What you are observing here may be related to what is referred to as the "blaze" angle of the grating.  For actual diffraction gratings, the individual peaks and troughs my not look like a simple profile of horizontal and vertical lines.  Instead the profile is more like a series of trapezoids.  By adjusting these angles grating manufacturers can tailor the optimum order and wavelength for the grating. Given that information it is not surprising that there is an optimum angle of incidence for any particular grating.  Now the question that still puzzles me is; why does the optimum angle change with distance to the slit?  As I alluded to in a post on another of cfastie's research notes, this may be because of the fact that the light from the slit still has an appreciable divergence angle when it reaches the grating, and that begs the question, is the optimum grating angle dependent on the wavelength at which you are measuring the resolution of the system?
