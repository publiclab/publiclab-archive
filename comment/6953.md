I'd seen that article-- and the fairly questionable position of the Corps that their position on effected areas had 'evolved'.  Thanks for following up and digging in.   The most troubling thing to me is that much of the coal to be exported is [sub-bituminous coal](http://montanacoalcouncil.com/) that plants in the US don't want to burn because its so dirty.  They're seeking an export market so it can be burned on the other side of the pacific rim.
