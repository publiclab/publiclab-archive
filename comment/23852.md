I wanted to know if B2 is == 435.83 and if G2 is == 546.07 nanometers. I am also interested in knowing how these values where chosen. I looked up some spectra of mercury on spectral workbench and we are using more wavelengths then appear in the mercury lamps analyzed with the software to determine fitness.
