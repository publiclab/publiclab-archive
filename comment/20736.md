For consideration: 
- Image processing/computer vision  courses that discuss lots of different research topics:  
https://github.com/MargaretAN9/Peggy/blob/master/computer%20vision%20course.md
-Applying AI to an environmental sorting  problems (microplastics/ algea/etc ) using techniques such as:
