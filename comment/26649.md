Hi [@warren](/profile/warren), thanks for your feedback!
So, as far as I know for an already established npm package like LEL, we need to bump up the version number (according to the patch, minor & major changes that the project goes through) and do "npm publish" each time we need to push updates to production. This doesn't include the steps that we take during the development (like transpiling, testing, building etc.). Actually, there's a personal project of mine which is in the development phase and I'm going to push it to npm soon (you can see it here: https://github.com/Rishabh570/cricfeed), so I'll make sure to fill the knowledge gaps that I may have currently.

Actually, I've never worked on plots2 but I've noticed that we use LEL  there and the relevant code is present in "/app/views/map" where "_mapDependencies.html.erb" uses the CSS & JS file that we build in LEL project (present in '/dist') which is included in the "/app/views/layouts/_header.html.erb" and that helps in importing the LEL files to the map in plots2. It is live at https://publiclab.org/map I reckon. Please let me know if this is not how LEL works in plots2.

Thanks!!! ðŸ˜ƒ
