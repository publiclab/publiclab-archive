If you have two cameras, and your goal is NDVI or false color infrared, the best way to get what you need is one unmodified camera and one with the IR block filter replaced with a visible light block filter that passes only NIR. The Wratten 87 is a good choice, but there are lots of other long-pass infrared filters. Another option is a Wratten 25A which provides a pretty pure NIR channel in the camera's blue channel, but the Wratten 87 gives you all three channels of NIR, so three times more light (although that may be irrelevant).
