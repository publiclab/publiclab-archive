Maybe we should create an issue on the WebJack project so as not to make this thread too long. 

I made some progress (rather crudely) copying over the 2-parameter `write(const uint8_t *buffer, size_t size)` method from the version of the SoftModem library  you linked to, into the SoftModemTiny library I found, and got bogged down in some C errors (statics not defined in scope). I'm pretty rusty in C, though.
