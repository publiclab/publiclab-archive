That's a good result from Infragram.org. The result could be different outside because the color of the light can influence the proportion of visible and near infrared light. To get a good measure of duckweed NDVI you might have to wait for a still, dry day so there is no water on the surface of the little leaves. A water surface will reflect lots of light and throw off the result.

Most spreadsheet programs make it easy to combine your three columns (day, month, year) into a single date column. The program will then recognize that as a date and allow you to graph it.
