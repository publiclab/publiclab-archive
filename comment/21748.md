Hi [@namangupta](/profile/namangupta), great idea. I guess React would be a better choice, because being a UI library, it's pretty lightweight compared to a fully fledged framework such as Angular, and rather than using Angular and writing it from scratch, we can use [react-rails](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails), to integrate React with the existing rails views and controllers. Just putting up an idea, let me know what do you think?
