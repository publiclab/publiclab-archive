I would have to check, it was over 20 feet for sure, it did bow quite a bit and I tried not to move too fast so that it wouldn't bend. Rough and dirty I would say that is about 1/5th of an acre. If you can see that is a community garden and the square plots are about 20 feet by 20 feet. I walked up and down the paths between plots in both directions and around the perimeter. This gave me about 80 pictures with suitable overlap. I would say that the pixel resolution is in the 1-2 cm range.
