[@fongvania](/profile/fongvania) [@stevie](/profile/stevie) Thank you for the EPA Colocation Instruction Guide slide deck. [@TravisLondon](/profile/TravisLondon) The info linked above in the slide deck does a great job of explaining precision and accuracy in data for air quality monitors, and how you can use existing high-quality monitors owned and maintained (typically) by existing federal or state agencies as reference monitors; you compare data from the reference AQ monitors to data from the DYI or other monitor you want to use for field use by collocating them: putting them together in the same place at the same time so they're both analyzing the same air. In an ideal situation, the DYI or other gives the same data as the reference.
