Hello! Nice work on the raspberry pi version of the spectrometer!

A question, for [@Warren](/profile/Warren) , does PublicLabs provide the NoIR version of the Camera? I'm currently working on this spectrometer for my college's Civil Engineering department. We originally started with the webcam, but found its limited range unhelpful for our desired applications (testing for metals in drinking water). As such, we've switched to a NoIR Raspberry Pi Camera which seems to be working alright (assuming I can replicate what was done up above. I didn't know there was a control program!). I was just wondering whether or not PublicLabs provides that specific camera in their kit.
