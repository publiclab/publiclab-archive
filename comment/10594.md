It sounds like a novel approach to breakdown formaldehyde.  However, if you're in a situation whereby outdoor air is cleaner than indoor air, wouldn't the easiest solution be to ventilate in outside air?  

A few formaldehyde testing methods use DI water as the capture media.  Thus, if you did want to collect formaldehyde, bubbling it through water might just be the solution.
