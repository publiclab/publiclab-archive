[@AFairbairn](/profile/AFairbairn) - I spent quite some time searching for reliable and cheap target material for calibrations. I spoke with someone who scanned Rustoleum flat black and said it looked usable. I will try to get more details. I found a material called Komatex that is a PVC material with a matte finish. I finally had my turn to have it spectral scan at the university after an almost 3 month wait but the operator never showed up. I was drawn to this material because it is used by a white balance card manufacturer who states it is neutral throughout the spectrum. Its also cheap and easy to clean.
I would recommend contacting Charlie Langlois at Labsphere- clanglois@labsphere.com They can make affordable($300 range)targets that are smaller 2X2" pieces that work great with same quality and accuracy as the targets that cost thousands. They still cost more than we like to see but is a good investment for some people.They have 94, 80, 50, 18, 10 , and 5 percent Permaflect targets. I have used the 94, 80, 50, and 5 percent targets so far and am very happy.
