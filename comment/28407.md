Hi there, [@warren](/profile/warren), [@cess](/profile/cess), [@bansal_sidharth2996](/profile/bansal_sidharth2996), and of course to all the community members, I have published the draft proposal for GSoC 2021 for the Translation System Refinements in plots2. I am still working on it and improving out the solutions and implementations as I am gaining insights. Everyone's feedback and review are most welcome. 
Thanks :)
Warm Regards,
Govind Goel
