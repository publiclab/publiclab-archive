Hi! This is looking great -- thanks! A few points and requests:

> these would be need to be migrated to this new system and possibly consolidated at a single location in the code.

Would we be able to maintain legacy APIs, or would we redirect them and provide documentation to people to upgrade? What's a list of legacy API endpoints to be sure we migrate?

Also, a lot of the comments I left for [@Raounak](/profile/Raounak) apply here too - take a look: https://publiclab.org/notes/Raounak/02-21-2018/gsoc-proposal-v2-api-development#c18864

Thanks a lot! Don't forget to take a look at related proposals by [@milaaraujo](/profile/milaaraujo), [@stefannibrasil](/profile/stefannibrasil), [@Raounak](/profile/Raounak), and [@sukhbir](/profile/sukhbir) -- and reach out to talk with them about their proposals too!

Thanks for all your great work in contributing already! Very much appreciated. :-)
