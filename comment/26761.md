Hmm, it looks like it should still be available via keybinding, according to the docs:

https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/blob/main/README.md#single-image-interface-1

Q and A keys... Can you try that? 

Then we need to see how to turn the button back on. [@sashadev-sky](/profile/sashadev-sky) do we just enable it in the constructor?
