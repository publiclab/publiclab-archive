Mathew - This is probably the result of a capacitor discharging, C9 is only 0.1uf. I suspect that C14 needs to be much larger (100uf)  or add multiple bulk caps throughout the board. The yellow negative going signal is my sync signal. It is occurring approx 65msec after reset.

I plan on doing more experiments today. Currently the board is connected to a powered USB hub. I want to try different combinations of USB and battery power.

It occurred to me that my initial total failures were with the LiPo battery installed and connected to a Laptop USB port. Perhaps the battery needed to be charged and there is insufficient power available.
