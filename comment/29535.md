Hi, Great writing! I have a question about using PointCab Suite. I read the introduction of Point cloud to BIM on an article https://www.marsbim.com/blog/scan-to-bim-introduction-from-technology-to-the-bim-model/ and understand about PointCab Suite Revit. And I know that PointCab Suite is powerful tool for point cloud modeling and is easily managed.LAS files and convert them into.RCP format. But when to load that file in Revit, I received some issues with that process. Is there any other format to directly open point cloud files into Revit? Thanks.
