Brother Will, who sent me the lantern slides, asked a good question today: What is a lantern slide? I guess I should have assumed that many folks born after Kodachrome came to dominate the color slide business in the 1940s would have no idea that people have been projecting still images onto walls and screens for three and a half centuries. The earliest devices, known as Magic Lanterns, used transparent paintings or drawings, and usually relied on candles or oil lamps for illumination. It took only ten years after photography was invented in 1839 for a couple of professional daguerreotypists in Philadelphia to make a glass plate negative of a glass plate negative and produce a transparent positive image which could be used as a Magic Lantern slide. Although the primary use of lantern shows was entertainment, classroom educators quickly recognized their value, and disciplines like the history of art and architecture came to rely heavily on collections of lantern slides. The primary lecture halls in museums and academic institutions everywhere had lantern slide projectors which eventually used electric bulbs and accepted 3 x 4 inch or slightly larger slides. 

The lantern slides Will sent me are apparently typical. They consist of two thin glass plates sealed around the edges with black paper tape. There is nothing between the glass, although later versions could have sandwiched a film positive in there. In the standard process, one of the pieces of glass was a photographic plate, and was used in a camera to make a negative image of a negative image of the desired scene. The developed plate with a positive transparent image became half of the lantern slide with the emulsion protected on the inside. You could make these yourself, but many businesses would take any image you sent them and return a lantern slide. Commercially available sets of lantern slides (guess what one of the earliest uses was) were often hand colored.  

The modern Kodachrome process was announced in 1935. Kodak introduced a projector for 2 x 2 inch slide mounts in 1939.  During the following decades certain academic disciplines suffered the same gnashing that is currently forcing many educators to abandon their vast color slide collections. Middlebury College announced this spring that slide projectors will no longer be available in most lecture rooms starting in 2014.
