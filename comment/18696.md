Hi, this is a great start. It would be great if you'd take a first step at making a small contribution to our code, at https://publiclab.github.io/community-toolbox/#r=all -- we're happy to help you get started!

I also wanted to note that we have a lot of issues we'd like to solve in JavaScript over on the Editor project:

https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor/issues

Take a look! We'd love your help!
