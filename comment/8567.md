Thank you Dave!!! Based on your earlier advice that you left on my spectrum, i added non-reflective paper around the back of my phone's camera to reduce reflection. Thank you very much. 

I am still dealing with the difference between the spectrum shown on the preview screen (which looks good) to the clipped spectrum i see once capturing.
