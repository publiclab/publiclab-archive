Hi Matthew,
It's good to see this interest in PLOTS. A couple other open source (or nearly so) packages related to 3D mapping are:
SURE (compatible with VisualSFM output): 
http://www.ifp.uni-stuttgart.de/publications/software/sure/index.en.html

Ecosynther: described here with links: http://ecosynth.org/profiles/blogs/ecosynther-v0-7

There was a nice overview of several (mostly proprietary) packages in this paper:
