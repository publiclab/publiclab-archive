Hi Scott,
A Gigapan account is free, although you can pay for commercial features. The minimum limit on all gigapan uploads is 50 megapixels (not megabytes). Most real gigapan panoramas are much bigger than that, so that was originally a filter to keep out non-gigapan uses of the site. Now just a few photos from new cameras can be stitched together to meet that threshold. If you have 10 photos stitched together into a map, and the map is exported at full resolution, it is probably close to 50 megapixels. If not quite there, just add a border around it, or use Photoshop to increase the resolution a bit. The map image embedded above is 150 MP.

Don't forget to make snapshots with captions before you generate the embedding code.
