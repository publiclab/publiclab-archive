Hi stevie!! Cool experiment!</br> 
In relation to white or high reflecting surfaces It's important to have in mind that reflected light meters are calibrated to measure [between a 12 and 18% of grey](http://www.bythom.com/graycards.htm) so usually snow or frozen surfaces photographed become grey and not white. The lightometer "thinks" there's more light than the light that really is been reflected  (because of the high reflection of the surface) and takes the picture a little bit underexposed. It's important in these cases to overexpose a little bit the picture so the frozen surface gets it's real white color.</br>

Thinking about the temperature I've remembered the work of the friends of [ASHAB](http://ashab.space) Asturias High Altitude Balloning. They launched a Soyouz replica with a ballon to 35km of altitude. The capsule is made of expanded poliestirene covered with a cheap golden termal tissue and reached the 35km with an inside temperature of 20ยบ celsius . Maybe you can make some kind of enclosure to keep the temperature of the trail camera. Maybe your camera can reach really low temperatures and this is unnnecesary... anyway keep us informed ;D</br>
