Thank you very much for explanations. I would like to test electrodes for supercapacitor, and assambled supercapacitors (~0.5 to 20 miliF).  May be I will use the WheeStat as controller for electrochemical deposition.  100 mv\sec is enough for my tests for now.  I think we will be required to adjust voltage step to make measurements more smooth, but it depend how many current  sample can be measured per step and time offset of the measurement. I guess that in fast response systems the current inside a time frame of steps is not distributed equally.  Thanks again. I.
