 Hey, first: welcome to PublicLab! Glad you could make it. I promise you won't regret it ;-)

Really cool project. One question: Do you plan to integrate an API for this? For example, it would be really cool if I could write a query to get the noise level for a specific location.

Thanks for sharing this!

PS: It makes much more fun to share projects and be a part of the community when you are using a personal profile and not a profile for this project ;-)
