[@warren](/profile/warren) [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1) -- we also tried using one of these lights -- https://www.amazon.com/Cat-CT1000-Pocket-COB-Light/dp/B012BR6D1E/ -- and found that it was _too_ bright, though now that I think about it I didn't look very hard at camera settings to see if manual white-balancing or other settings would fix the problem.

If we did enough experimentation to feel confident on there being an optimal light placement we could add some kind of LED holder to the design like the openflexure microscope has, but I'm not confident that there even _is_ an ideal general placement, let alone what it is, which is why something adjustable seems nice.
