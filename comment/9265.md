Ah, ok.  That's really good to know.  Looking at the map above - right: horizontal labels are individually more readable, but filling the map with horizontal labels reduces readability for the whole map.

Time for me to dive into the SVG text element spec! This will involve adding to Leaflet core.  Leaflet core currently support a bunch of SVG types, all at [Leaflet/src/layer/vector](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/tree/master/src/layer/vector) - but not text.

Continuing to work on the implementation with L.Draw.Rectangle and L.DivIcon will take me down another path, so I'm going to put that aside in order to focus on the full-functionality SVG text implementation.
