Thank you [@keshav_sethi0004](/profile/keshav_sethi0004) , this is incredible progress and it's great to see! I shared the link to /spam2 with the moderators group a few days ago, and here's what we heard back from [@stevie](/profile/stevie) 

Hi neat!
Lots of good work here. It took a bit for it to load for me, so I found myself guessing what each button did before I had a chance to interact with it. I found myself wanting to know if some were filters and others actions. I did figure this out once I was able to interact with it, but it might be good to label them as such on the page so people don't have to click things to find out. 

Between the two button lines - top radio buttons on actions and second line, there's a lot. I might recommend we consider reducing these. Here are some thoughts I had on them

Top bar: 
- what does "delete" do? I can't imagine we want to delete from the page, just mark spam and publish. I could imagine if we have both, we could end up with different practices if some people delete posts and others just mark as spam.
- I'm not sure of the usefulness of "select" - what purpose does it serve? 
- I'm also not sure I know the difference between "spam" and "ban." I thought they did the same thing in our system right now? 

Second bar: 
- I'd move the "reset all" button to the far right of this row since there are filter functions after it. It's a little confusing in the middle.
- The "unmoderated" button is new and probably helpful. 
- What are the "page" and "note" ones? is that research notes vs wiki pages? I'm wondering if this would be a more useful identifier in the table itself rather than as a button filter feature. I might move those two buttons to be part of one of the dropdowns rather than filters that stand out on their own.

Dropdowns: 
- There seem to be a lot of filter functions, some in the bar itself, and two spaces to sort by in dropdowns. I would probably pick between the two drop down menus - The one in the top bar or the one in the bottom. 
- I'm not sure how the sort by "title" and "author" one would be helpful, just because we'll have so many, I see those being more useful under the search function rather than in the sort by function. 

Table:
- Same questions with the usefulness of sort by title or author. Since we have so many, it's not useful to us without support of something like an alphabet to sort from. I think a good search feature for those could get rid of the need for this feature, unless it's made more useful by something like an alphabet. 

Lots of good work here! No need to answer everything I asked, just food for thought. Thank you!
