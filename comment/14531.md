Hi,

Iam back with some update on the project.
I didn't tweak the program but I brought the written 87 filter. and put everything on my phantom 2.

I made an othomosaic maps of the the picture obtained. 
Everything works fine except that Fiji do not accept the picture as they do not have the camera data in exif and when I tried to make the NDVI with photoshop everything is in gray.

Do you have any idea?

The good news is that I talked with a professor at the university and I may be able to calibrate the pinoir. the bad news is that he will only come back in 3 week :/
