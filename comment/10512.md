Thanks.

The black square is kind of ambiguous at the moment - I don't know what works best yet.

It has in the past been a horizontal slit, then a vertical slit and currently it is now a dot.

Also, in my current rendition of this, I have made it so that you can move the slit to be at any angle against the toilet roll tube.

This is supposed to act like focusing a lens on a camera.

Thanks for the advice on the diffraction grating. It is now marked with a green dot.

I would love to see/hear other people's attempts at this (if there are any)!

My old public labs spectrometer is bust so I am stuck using a super low definition camera & mobile phone cameras at the moment.

An issue I noticed with using a  mobile phone is shielding out the light fully.

It was the reason that I put a lip around the hole for the camera, but even then, not all mobile phones have cameras in the same places.

My in-office solution to this is, stick a post-it note across the flap and then use that to shield your camera from outside light sources.

Also, it isn't specified in the instructions, but, you can cut the light rest to whatever shape best fits the light of your choice.

(I have a laser pen, but it isn't as bright as my Tech-Titan, which is huge and bulky).
