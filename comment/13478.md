Hey Dave! Man this is great tech info, love it, the 23w cfl that I use is 1600 lumens, I can see by the graph data that I may try the 14w and see how that works. A question for you, I have noticed that at the angle that I point my cfl at, is optimal than when it is pointed straight ahead, can that be because of the slight protrusion of the bulb itself at the front?

Also I was wondering if I am at the limits of the webcam's capabilities and the diffraction DVD, since I can't get beyond a quality fit of under 4 on calibration?
