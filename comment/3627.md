Dear Smokey, as explained earlier, this spectrometer can read light intensity in spectral range 400 - 900 nm which is mostly visible light. So you measure colours - this is pretty useful for the Kombutcha for example but if you wanna measure concentration of colorless compounds, you cannot use simple spectra analysis. You would need for example titration, so you can measure color of the solution.

For example - if you wanna measure pH of water, you are not able to do so using only the spectrometer, but you can add <a href="http://www.aquaristikshop.com/cgi-bin/neu/webshop.pl?f=NR&c=128022+*+128222&t=temartic_e&userid=jySmesWLs3g29YN6dM9sn5MUNuzFXvx7aYk">indicator </a>to water and measure the color of the result. You can measure pH then :)

So when uploading spectra, please, try to provide as much information as possible about sample, conditions, light source and so on.

Have fun.
