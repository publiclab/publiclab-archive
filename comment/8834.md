Hello Mercy - so, in the EXIF tags of camera photos is a lot of metadata. For cameras (like those on smartphones) which have GPS and a tilt sensor and compass, some camera apps can store this data (i.e. where the camera was and how high and where it was pointed or tilted) in those EXIF tags. On Linux, you can use the `exiftool` utility to read them; there are lots of tools available for reading/writing EXIF tags. 

Does that make sense?
