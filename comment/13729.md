Hi!

I was in the filed without internet. 
I wrote a program that trigger the photo on the second pi when a picture is taken with the first so it is instantaneous.
I read [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/whats-that-blue-thing-doing-here/) that:
"If you put the little blue filter (Rosco) over the lens (or behind it), then you can learn even more about plant health. The Rosco filter blocks most red light but passes the blue end of the spectrum and also near infrared light. The blue channel will now capture visible blue light as usual (plus some infrared) but there is no red light for the red channel to capture so it captures mostly near infrared light."

What is your point of view. I'll go back in the field tomorrow, so, no internet again for a few day.
