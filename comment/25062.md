hi! This is a big question! I think one of the older ones is Humanitarian Open Street Maps, but that's just to my knowledge on it. There was a good bit of work here coming out of Harvey and Irma, and a group that organizes on slack here: opencrisisresponse.slack.com. 

Maybe [@liz](/profile/liz), you could share more about that or other groups? 

Two of the Public Lab [Barnraisings](www.publiclab.org/barnraising) have had some form of disaster response in their theme. The [Barnraising and Crisis Convening](https://publiclab.org/wiki/barnraising-newark-2018) in Newark last year, and the one in [Texas](https://publiclab.org/wiki/barnraising-texas-2019) this past spring. You can read more about them on those links and check out some of the materials and resources people shared. 

 With the tech. question, I think it's really powerful and can be really helpful, but it needs to be appropriate to the needs of people affected locally. We risk running into issues of tech solutionism, and in times of disaster response, things that aren't a right fit for a community can be extractive.
