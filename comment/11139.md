Hi Everyone

Just thought I should post a progress update on the Cave Pearl Project. We finished off 2014 with a challenging field trip that had some great success, and some very frustrating sensor failures. You can read through the field reports on that work starting here:

But the real reason I am posting is that I have finally figured out how to make reasonable underwater housings from Formufit PVC parts, that have very few fabrication steps:

I have also developed a simple DIY underwater connector system that uses pex tubing adapters, and given all the other water related projects at Public lab, I am hoping that this info helps give them a boost.
