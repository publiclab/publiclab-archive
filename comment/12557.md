Hi guys, Liz Barry suggested me to contact you. I am an artist working on a "toolbox for bioremediation" This is part of my larger international project Manuals for Public Space. Earlier this year we did a balloon mapping project together with the PL and Newtown Creek Alliance. Right now this project is part of Art in Odd Places Festival at the 14th street.
I would be very happy if we could do a workshop using your soil testing kit on Oct. 11th. I talked to Liz and she suggested to ask you if I could borrow a kit from you. Of course I will announce PL and your group as partners and lot of people (even internationally) will get the opportunity to see that.
Please let me know if you are interested, and if it would be possible to borrow the kit! Thank you so much! :-)
