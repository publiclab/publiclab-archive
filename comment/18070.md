Thanks [@warren](/profile/warren) and [@richardbowman](/profile/richardbowman) for replying, it's appreciated. I'm quite familiar with microscopes and macro photography. I have a Nikon Optiphot Biological microscope and a Nikon MM-11 (DIC, POL, BF, epi-fluorescence, epi DIC etc.) setups. I just thought this would be a interesting project.  I wasn't even sure which build I wanted to give a try.
