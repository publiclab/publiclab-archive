Super cool project! I've been thinking about how we can use lawn space better and this is an awesome example :) 

I'm sure there are a lot of useful questions, but off the top of my head here are some I can come up with:
- What species are supported by the tool and do they align with the ones you're interested in?
- Whether or not you're interested in seeing pollinator data from groups not affiliated with your project and if so, what types of data and what region(s) are  well represented
- Ease of use of the tool

Other tools I've come across include [Insight Citizen Science](https://insightcitizenscience.com/) and [iNaturalist](https://wildpollinatorcount.com/resources/inaturalist/)
