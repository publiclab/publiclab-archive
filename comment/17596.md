Hi everyone, just to provide an update. First, thanks for all your help. I sent a letter to the DOJ probation officer after I attempted to collaboratively bring up my concerns (sharing of data is only one of many). It was apparent they (UB) had already made their decision to not listen to me and told me that I was wrong in thinking that our project was a collaboration. University at Buffalo VP told me "This is a dictatorship" yea, that really happened. I couldnt believe it. The next day I wrote a letter to the DOJ probation officer with a number of concerns supported by facts. UB responded with a defaming letter (I think I was targeted personally at least 15-20 times). The best one was that they alluded to the fact that I cannot have the data because Im on a lawsuit seeking damages and I might change the data. Needless to say, the DOJ is mighty angry with their behavior. We have a meeting at the DOJ court building on Tuesday. I was told I just have to sit and listen. I am relieved and feel positive about the outcome.   I could write a book about this craziness.
