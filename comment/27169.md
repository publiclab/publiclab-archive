Hi John, thanks for the tip on QFH antennas. It's good to know one can make one without soldering. Also, do you know about the Russian Meteor fleet? You mention that the old Russian polar orbiters are no longer operational, but the Meteor fleet is operational, and there have been several guides published on how to decode images from these sats. The Meteor images are also markedly higher resolution (400m / pixel) than those of NOAA sats (4km / pixel). The process is a bit more involved and technical than decoding NOAA sats but your QFH would work perfectly. In case you want another challenge here is a good resource: http://happysat.nl/Setup_Meteor/Setup.html
