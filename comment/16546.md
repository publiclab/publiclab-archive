Hi [@mridulnagpal](/profile/mridulnagpal) Sorry for neatpicking but I saw you mentioned "using Drupal" at some places like
> Week 3 (6 June - 12 June): Integrating map features such as privacy options, removing maps to the backend using ruby controllers and Drupal.

> Week 7 (4 July - 10 July): Adding external information such as gear required, organizers, etc. to any event notes' map (By using Drupal to add location to the notes).

Drupal is a different framework and isn't used in plots2. Perhaps you tried to convey something else?
