Hello, 

Do a material balance around the water usage in home--see if the school will work with you too. After you have a week of measurements, implement gathering and educate family members on how to preserve water in the home. After 2 weeks of information campaign, do a material balance around your home. Compare if the averages are different by using the Student's t test or similar.
