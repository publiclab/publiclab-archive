In that case, perhaps a better question would be about using the sensor pod as a platform for RIFFLE or other Open Water tools?
 The only problem with the GPS method, is it would either have to be highly accurate, or the sample area would have to be wider.  This would be a problem because while the Seaglide can move autonomously, it can't NAVIGATE autonomously...  A wide sample area would either require a really long leash or the addition of some kind of navigation capability.  If it already has a GPS, then NAV would not be impossible and could probably be ported from Arduino-UAV sources like MultiWii.  But AFAIK, it really can't control its direction very well in its present configuration. I don't think adding such a capability would be impossible either, but would likely require quite a bit more testing...
