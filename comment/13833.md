The both curve sets appear to have some variation which I believe is simply attributable to the repeatability error of the spectrometer with >2nm resolution at best. The LED curves, with broader bandwidth, I believe more easily shows some filtering effect of glass -- mostly from the appearance of a broader and smoother curve with the quartz as might be expected. That said, I don't have an explanation for the higher signal level for glass out at 460nm. The 405nm laser plot appears to show there is no significant attenuation out to 400nm for glass. However, a 405nm comparison between quartz and acrylic cuvettes might be a more practical comparison for those using the PLab for oil sample tests -- acrylic might have more attenuation at UV wavelengths.
