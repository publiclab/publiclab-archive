"You could try a summa canister: http://summacanister.com/ (they are offered by many labs not just this one). it is basically a sterile bowling ball that has all of the air vacuumed out of it and then you put it in your house and open the valve and it sucks in air at a known rate and then you take that to the lab and they can run a full analysis on all the chemicals they find in there. my guess is that it would be under 500 including shipping and analysis.

The other option is some people will rent you instruments so you could rent a fancy HCHO meter for a day and get all your measurements that way. without the huge investment.

BUT saying all this, you might want to just try remediation as often in manufactured housing its hard to get rid of the engineered woods that off-gas hcho.... I would avoid spending [the money on a PID VOC meter]. I'm also not sure if they can measure as low as you would want as you will be looking at parts per billion not parts per million. They are often made for use in heavy industry where they have crazy high levels."
