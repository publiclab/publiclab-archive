That's a great development. Thanks for alerting me to that. The key to this advance is knowing how to structure the KML code to define the color of each individual  segment of a line. I had always defined a line in KML as below which colors the entire line the same color:

    <Style>
	<LineStyle>
		<color>ffff00ff</color>
		<width>3</width>
	</LineStyle>
    </Style>

    <Placemark>
	<MultiGeometry>
		<LineString>
			<coordinates>
    -72.994171,43.951747,437.6
    -72.994163,43.951751,438.7
    -72.994148,43.951751,438.2
    -72.994148,43.951747,438.1
    -72.99414,43.951744,438.8
    -72.99414,43.951744,437.9
    -72.994163,43.951744,437.2
			</coordinates>
		</LineString>
	</MultiGeometry>
    </Placemark>

Now I know that the structure below will define the color for only the single line segment described by the ``<coordinates>`` tag:

    <Placemark>
        <Style>
          <LineStyle>
            <color>ff472f7d</color>
            <width>4</width>
          </LineStyle>
        </Style>
        <LineString>
          <coordinates>
             -0.562935,51.423039,47.530000 
             -0.562931,51.423023,47.530000
          </coordinates>
        </LineString>
     </Placemark>

I am still not sure how to use the Python code to create a KML file like this, but I will work on that.

Thanks,  
Chris
