Well, the 470nm vs 532nm is likely the most important -- the peak in your plot is probably dominated by the source while they reference at 470nm is at a wavelength which is shorter than the plotted data (and probably filtered out by their system). Given the huge "in-band" 532nm source, plus the added peak at ~570nm, using a 532nm laser to make such fluorescence measurements become much more complicated at best. Unfortunately, without more sophisticated processing, amplitude correction and proof such processing is valid, 532nm plots should be considered suspect; their data is much too obscured to use for comparison.
