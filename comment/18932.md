Hi, [@Metamer](/profile/Metamer) -- i think i was chatting with you in the chatroom? If so we got disconnected. If you want to post another question just like this one (you can post at http://publiclab.org/questions) I'll do my best -- there's some great additional Raspberry Pi spectrometer material at [#raspberry-pi-spectrometer](/tag/raspberry-pi-spectrometer) too.
