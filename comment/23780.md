 The United States pharm. had a lot of tests for lead and other elements( like arsenic and barium).  You can't argue with its scientific validity- it's recognized by th e FDA.  Here is a list of monographs some new, some from the 2012s, so you may have to do a little digging.  They aren't all called lead.  They may be called heavy metals or extractables.  It's a start.

Monographs- 231-232-233-251-211-381-661-2232

Let me know if you need more info
