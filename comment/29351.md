Hi all- 
Update on my project... currently thinking about the potential for disturbance off the samples using a carousel to move petri dishes toward the raspberry pi camera. The samples are plant roots in an incubator held under 100% continuous light, it is possible that moving petri dishes every 15 minutes to capture photos may introduce some disturbance. Currently brainstorming other methods of moving the plates toward the raspberry pi camera or perhaps have the camera move toward the petri dishes instead. If anyone has any ideas please let me know!
