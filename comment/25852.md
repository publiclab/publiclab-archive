No luck on this one either. Not sure what portion of this lens assembly is the IR portion, but there was not a single layer on the back like I was hoping. I removed the first piece (from the back) and  that appears to be part of the optics for focusing. 
The webcam would not focus in good without it. 
I then tried to bust out the front part with a red tint, but that pretty much will only shatter then press everything out of it. There are like 5 layers to the lens. Not sure which one is IR. In the picture, the front piece of optic with the redish tint is what is shattered. The rest pushed out. 

Not sure where to go from here. I was thinking maybe I can buy a lens for this camera that has no IR? But I hope the IR is not on the CCD'?

This basically looks about the same as the first webcam lens assembly.
