Your underwater NIR device would not need as much light baffling as a visible light device, but it might need some. It would depend on how sensitive your NIR sensor was to visible light or near-visible light and how bright your NIR source was (so whether your sensor saw the source as well as it saw the attenuated solar signal).

The pool steps below are visible a few feet under water in the NIR photo. So NIR light is travelling through a few feet of water twice to get captured by the camera (which had a Wratten 87 filter so captured almost no visible light but did capture NIR light as short as 740 nm).

If your sensor is blind at wavelengths shorter than 900 nm, and your source produces at longer wavelengths, the solar signal will be less of an issue, but maybe not zero of an issue.
