Hi Sara,
I think the original idea with this model was that it could be used to calculate the volume of vegetation (above some ground plane) of each of the 52 study plots. This could then be related to the biomass of the plants there which could help reveal which treatments had an effect.  I am not sure that will be very easy to do because the model does not have horizontal dimensional control -- note that the rectangular plots are longer at one end of the study area than the other (they should all be the same size).  It might instead be possible to use many random measurements of height of the plant canopy in each plot and relate that to plant growth. Deriving such quantitative results requires calibration, so maybe poles of known height could have been placed throughout the field before it was photographed (although that might not really work).

Regardless of whether quantitative results come from this, it is a great way to display the geometry of small landscapes.  Topography, geographic features, vegetative structure, and the built environment can all be displayed in "3D" either on the web or during a presentation. Most people, even those who do not relate to maps, get the picture very fast when they can fly around a landscape. So an important value of this tool is as an effective way to direct an audience's attention to some feature of a 3D space.  It can also reveal details of geography that might be overlooked on the ground or from much higher altitudes and could have application in lots of different endeavors.
