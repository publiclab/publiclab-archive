Hi Caroline! I could post this on the DC Women and Bicycles forum and a couple other bike groups I'm a part of. I think some of the cyclists I know in DC would love to help you with this (also happy to post to our EPA bike group listserve to see if any EPA employees who bike commute could help out)  Let me know if you're okay with me cutting and pasting the description, and if so, what contact info I should put with it. An email address?
