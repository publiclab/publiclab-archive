Hi Ben! Catching up on this now, I guess it's running [#open-pipe-kit](/tag/open-pipe-kit), right? 

How long ago was the last data upload and what's changed since, if anything? If I remember it was set up to use PageKite (https://pagekite.net/) to have a stable way to connect in, do you know if that's still working?
