Hi Greg!

Just revisiting this here (rather than on Twitter -- 140 char would almost be over right *now* :)).  

The platform looks fantastic.  Re: getting Riffle data into it, the Riffle's current hardware + software repository is here:

https://github.com/OpenWaterProject/riffle

There you can find the Eagle files for ordering a PCB, and some starter Arduino code for recording values.  It's built so that it appears exactly as an Arduino UNO in the Arduino IDE, so there's nothing particularly special about the code.  It's recording timestamped sensor readings as a CSV file to a microSD card, and one can choose to format that file however one likes -- it could, e.g., be JSON instead of CSV.  So I think getting data into the PhotosynQ platform should be pretty straightforward?

It looks like there will be an 'alpha' version of the Riffle (the main board, plus the conductivity + temp + light sensor add-on module) for around $150 available pretty soon (in the next weeks, I think).  I'll be pinging the lists with updates as I know more.

Cheers!
D
