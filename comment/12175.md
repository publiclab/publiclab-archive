Hi RQ-05,
Using Infragrammar in the Infragram sandbox is a good way to experiment. I usually use Ned Horning's Fiji plugin to produce NDVI images. It allows a couple of things that are hard to do at infragram.org. To make the image below, I stretched the histogram of the NIR (blue) channel and applied the included color table.  
.  
[![RQ-05NDVI.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/661/medium/RQ-05NDVI.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/661/original/RQ-05NDVI.jpg)  
.  
The NDVI values are in the right ballpark, but could be a little higher. If your photo from the camera is a little more turquoise, the NDVI values could be closer to where they should be.
