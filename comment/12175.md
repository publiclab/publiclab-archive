Hi RQ-05,
Using Infragrammar in the Infragram sandbox is a good way to experiment. I usually use Ned Horning's Fiji plugin to produce NDVI images. It allows a couple of things that are hard to do at infragram.org. To make the image below, I stretched the histogram of the NIR (blue) channel and applied the included color table.  
.

.  
The NDVI values are in the right ballpark, but could be a little higher. If your photo from the camera is a little more turquoise, the NDVI values could be closer to where they should be.
