This is a great question and we need better (or just more refined) solutions. But there are a few options to start with:

1. https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi and upload via the SpectralWorkbench.org API. 
2. [This question](https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/12-05-2017/how-can-we-stream-video-to-spectralworkbench-org-or-infragram-org-from-a-raspberry-pi-camera) proposes a way forward by streaming video to SpectralWorkbench.org or Infragram.org from a Raspberry Pi camera over a local network, which seems promising! 

That last one is especially promising in combination with [this idea of connecting the Raspberry Pi to a host computer via USB and running networking over that cable too](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/12-15-2017/how-can-we-set-up-a-raspberry-pi-camera-as-an-ethernet-usb-device-to-avoid-using-wifi) which you're already involved in! 

Thanks, [@cedarlodge](/profile/cedarlodge)! We've got some great ways to make this process more seamless and I really appreciate your taking these next steps!
