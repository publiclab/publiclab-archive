Hi again, 

This document may be useful in deciphering situations in which CALPUFF would be more appropriate than AERMOD: [https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/scram/7thconf/calpuff/calpuff_near-field_technical_issues_092608.pdf](https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/scram/7thconf/calpuff/calpuff_near-field_technical_issues_092608.pdf). It looks like wind-channeling valleys are the sorts of terrain in which CALPUFF can be significantly more accurate than AERMOD at predicting contaminant dispersion.
