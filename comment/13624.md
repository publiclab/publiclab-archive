Thank you.  

It's worth reminding people not to be fooled by the low perceived brightness at the 405nm end of the spectrum -- the lighted spot looks dim, but the photons are very high energy and can do damage even though you don't see them.   I wish I knew a simpler way to explain this to people.

I happen to have had -- in one eye --  the older type cataract implant, from before they blocked any of the UV-to-blue wavelengths.  

I can see UV with that eye (and no, I don't leave that eye unprotected).  It makes a comparison easy, though.  With my normal eye I barely see the violet laser dot.  With the unfiltered lens in the cataract implant eye, I see a brilliant violet circle with a bright white center, from the exact same dot.

There's a hell of a lot of energy in the 405nm lasers, and people can't see almost any of that.

This guy had the same cataract surgery and does a great job explaining it:
