That's really helpful, thank you!   I feel like I need to reread and synthesize this a bit, since I still have a very rudimentary idea of how microscope optics work.  

We had a lot of problems with dust getting stuck on the sensor -- though my recollection is that the pixels on the sensor are themselves in the 1-2 um range  (I'd have to look it up for sure) so it's sort of nice to just imagine it as a rough calibration of the fine particles you're breathing in the room as you're setting up the microscope.   Poetic, but not perfect.   You can see them all over our images.
