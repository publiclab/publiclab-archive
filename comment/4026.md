Ok, this spectrum is completely messed up in its calibration and graph... spectral workbench at its finest, github issue documented...

BUT it is a 1600x1200 full resolution capture. Its a clear reading but it is almost impossible to work with in spectral workbench because I can barely see the damned image on my monitor.  A gain control may be warranted if we use this camera.
