This is a really neat idea.  thanks for working on this distance calibration.  

I have a stud finder that has felt on the bottom, and sounds similar to what you're thinking of for a wall mounting It has an LED protruding from the top, away from the spot that my hand holds against the wall. I'm sure a similar setup would work well. 

also, there are wall climbing remote control toy cars that cost $15-25.  [Watch this one drive on the ceiling.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_nYNuoZteA) I don't know if they could carry a payload.
