Hi Alex,

I haven't experimented much with webcams yet, so I don't know the answer.  I do know that a narrow slit is critical for precisely identifying peaks.  And I know that a grating made from a DVD-R produces very good results which can be marginally improved by substituting cheap grating replica film. Then all you have to do is capture an image of the spectrum with a camera. The resolution of an HD webcam is plenty adequate (if you can use the whole sensor), so the critical issues are probably focus and exposure.  A crisply focused image is an obvious requirement for resolving peaks. Exposure seems to be tricky because overexposure obscures the peaks by truncating them, and underexposure obscures peaks by not recording them at all. I guess most webcams work in auto exposure mode, but might not perform well when confronted with a black field and a few bright lines.  Some webcams probably have better dynamic range (ability to record both bright and dim subjects) than others. So camera choice and setup will be important for good results.  I will be interested to learn if a webcam can produce results similar to those above.
