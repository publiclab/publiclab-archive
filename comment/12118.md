Pat, 
Photomerge is doing a good job stitching your photos. It is not including many photos with sky, which might be because those photos do not overlap enough with each other. If you used the default mode (Mode 0) in version 004 or 005 of the sketch, the rig will take eight photos per rotation which might not be enough for the 28mm lens of the A1200. Mode 2 should work better (9 photos/rotation), and Mode 6 will also work (10 photos/rotation if you are using version 005 of the sketch). It's easy to edit the sketch so that any mode is the default.

Photomerge has a spherical mode, so it should not have a problem with half spherical panoramas. But it does not have a method of displaying spherical panoramas similar to the viewer at Photosynth. So the flattened spherical panorama is always going to look distorted. I will try to stitch one of my sets in Photomerge and see how it works. 

Thanks for the testing.
Chris
