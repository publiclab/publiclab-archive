Hi Rayishido,

They are beautiful mosaics. I didn't have any problem using these images in Fiji. But the Photo Monitoring plugin does not do a very good job aligning mosaic images like these. Slight differences between the VIS and NIR mosaics don't allow the SIFT algorithm to rubber sheet the images enough to align them well. I did some manual alignment in Photoshop first and then it worked better in Fiji, but the registration is still not consistent across the image. You can see that best in the NRG image:

[![VISali_NRG2k.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/954/medium/VISali_NRG2k.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/954/original/VISali_NRG2k.jpg)  

The same registration is used for the NDVI image, so the values it computes might not be very reliable:

[![RayNDVI2ka.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/955/medium/RayNDVI2ka.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/955/original/RayNDVI2ka.jpg)

It might be possible to get better registration with the options in the plugin.

I think somebody is working on a Python program that will combine the photo pairs into four channel TIFFs. Then those can be stitched together and the single mosaic can be used to compute NDVI. But I might have than plan wrong.
