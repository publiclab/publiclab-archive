I figured out what I was doing wrong with the real time clock. This line in a sketch:

     RTC.adjust(DateTime((__DATE__), (__TIME__))); 

will set the time on the RTC when the sketch is loaded from the Arduino IDE. This line does not have to be present in the sketch after the sketch is first loaded because the RTC will always keep time. If this line is present the next time the Arduino is powered on, and no sketch is loaded, the Arduino will somehow reset the RTC to the time of the previous sketch load. I don't know how the Arduino stores this old time, but it does. So this line must be removed from the sketch after the RTC time has been set.

Done. 

Now I am ready for some indoor, or short-term, or extension-cord environmental data logging. For about $15, with no soldering, I can log pressure and temperature. For a few dollars more for each sensor, I can add humidity, light intensity, motion, orientation, compass direction, or infrared radiation. Other sensors cost a little more, and I have sent enough of my PayPal money to China for now.

I should be able to find something worthwhile to monitor.
