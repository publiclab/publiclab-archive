Ah, I see. Those keywords, DATE and TIME, refer to the time the sketch was compiled and are saved on the Arduino until a new sketch is loaded. 

That means that when that line of code sets the RTC time, it is already several seconds late because it takes several seconds to upload the sketch to the Arduino. So if you want more precise time on the RTC, you can do it manually from the serial monitor. Or maybe there is a less athletic way to do it.

Thanks zoomx,
