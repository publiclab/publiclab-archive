Microplastics are found everywhere in our world and are no bigger than 5mm (about 0.2 in).  Weathering of larger plastic products can create microplastics. These kinds of microplastics are called secondary microplastics. Degradation of macro-plastics create microplastics. 
Fishing nets are one of the main reasons for floating microplastics in the ocean. There is an estimated 14 million metric tons of microplastics on the ocean floor. The largest microplastic pollutant in the artic ocean is from laundry. In December of 2020, microplastics were found in the womb.  Bakelight, the first plastic, was created only just about 100 years ago. Plastics are non-biodegradable; they do not break down or decompose.
