Thanks for that map. I hadn't seen that one before. I will add it to my collection.

I agree with your sentiments on reading the landscape.

As I said - Cromer, Norfolk, UK is my hometown - I actually now live in Sunshine, Victoria, Australia - which has its own hidden creek issues.

In the UK - for the past few years - there have a number of successful waterway restoration projects.
(e.g. London, as the capital, being the most notable: http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jan/08/river-restoration-london)

As a comparison - Australia is a bit behind when it comes to environmental and heritage issues - but attitudes are (thankfully) changing - albeit slowly.

I will definitely be checking that film out!

Had you considered using documentation of the "weeds" in your neighborhood to further map out wetlands?
i.e. In addition to mapping where concentrated vegetation is growing directly above a stream - also mapping where hydrophilic plants (water loving "weeds") are growing most abundantly.
