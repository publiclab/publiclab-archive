Chris - if you're able to manually trigger your camera with the above voltages, you know I think you may be right and it's a faulty relay... can you upload a youtube clip or even an audio file of the "clicking" noise? It'd be surprising if you can audibly hear a sharp clicking but there's nothing happening. But the fact that you get a closed (on) connection for COM and NC but an open (off) connection for COM and NO suggests that the relay is the issue... worth trying out? 

BTW:

COM = Common
NC = Normally Closed ("on")
NO = Normally Open ("off")

Took me a little while to "get" that but it was helpful to me.

Posting soon with my own issues :-(
