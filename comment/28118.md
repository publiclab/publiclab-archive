**Thanks so much to everyone who joined this call!** 

A brilliant group of people came with questions, ideas, and lots of enthusiasm for working together on soil. Check out the call notes here: https://pad.publiclab.org/p/opencall

I'll be taking much of the input from the call to direct activities for the soil research area review and will post some questions with the [soil tag](https://publiclab.org/tag/soil) so we can work on them together ðŸ˜ƒ
