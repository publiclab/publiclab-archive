@ Warren, I will try to make a blog. Have to make time :-). There are a lot of differences with the measurements last year. Several different (and mostly new) sensors and the (successful) use of LoRaWAN beside WiFi, measuring 2,5 and 10 and the graphics in ug. There is also information in the English language here: https://www.samenmetenaanluchtkwaliteit.nl/international
