It was believed to be high level of nitrates, although maybe the time applied and amount applied has a major part in it, too. To be honest, I think more work needs done, both now and in the future. Water demand and food demand will both increase.  And the total reason for the problem doesn't seem to have been identified. As for the satellite, you maybe able to use an RTLSDR , with a fair number of accessories ( low noise amps, stuff like that) to receive the signal.  That's as long as the satellite signal is in the 24 Mhz to 1800 MHz range.  There are converters that could downconvert a higher frequency signal. But generally, at higher frequencies, you may have bandwidth problems.  The draft has a max bandwidth of about 2 Mhz. Maybe a little more, if you are lucky. Then software could be an issue.  Although there is already a lot of freeware for many satellites.
