Ah! When we did a million of these at makerfaire a few years ago I found a strategy worked for me was to flex the dvd back and forth for a while first -- you should hear/feel  some splintering, and you can kind of feel the DVD start to delaminate-- at a certain point you feel the splintering less and at that point it was pretty easy to pop apart, but I'd imagine that brands vary somewhat in terms of how well they're stuck together-- I seem to recall we got a batch of DVDs at some point that were just really tricky to pull apart.
