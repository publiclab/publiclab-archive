A condenser microphone with a 20 dB noise floor provides a reliably detectable response to about 2x10^-4 Pascals of sound pressure, where normal atmospheric pressure is 10^5 Pascals.  On a 5mm  microphone surface, 20dB is equivalent to gravity acting on about  0.1 micrograms.  If microphones can be built into integrated circuits cheap enough for cellphones, microgram scales can be made cheaply too.  It's only a matter of measuring charge displacement when micrograms push the plates of a condenser closer.
