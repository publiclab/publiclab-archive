Yes - I think it'd be ideal if writing up your work weren't a burdensome obligation, but if we thought about posting in an interactive, open forum like the PL website as an opportunity to get input and critique, suggestions and requests for clarification on our work. To re-emphasize why I like shorter, regular posts, it's not just to make the information 'more digestible', or to disseminate it "to the public" -- but also to invite others to respond, add value, challenge your assumptions, and to change your beliefs and approach through discussion. It's both give and get, to riff on Mathew's great point about domain expertise. If publishing is limited to only those folks who know how to use Github, aren't we missing out on key insights from a broad swath of potential collaborators?
