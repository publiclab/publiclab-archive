Hello [@warren](/profile/warren), 

What I mean by gamification of contribution process is that, contributors tend to be more active when they have points to achieve. The idea is to move to one level, then to next level and thus increasing the enthusiasm of contributors. Websites like stackoverflow and quora keep awarding points on the basis of vertical system rather than a more horizontal one. What I mean to say is that as the user bags more points he tends to move up in reputation and is given more exclusive access. The score can be incremented in multiple plays such as asking the right question or giving the right answer. Nevertheless, there is a central reputation system to maintain which is the score of that person. 

Currently barnsters are medals which are basically more horizontal way of doing things that is each of your action on the website would get you a particular barnster. 

It can be very well debated which of the methods is better - whether to have a central tendency and have a more competitive environment or to have a more horizontal environment which means all the badges have equal value and there are some for all. I would like to hear your opinion on which one is better?
