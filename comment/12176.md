Well There is a lot of blurring in the diffraction pattern that is formed.Also I have used the 0.12 mm collimated acetone slit. There is also a lot of overexposure of light and hence not giving an accurate spectrum. Since I am analysing Carbon Nanotubes, I need a well resloved spectrum inorder to find out absorbtion of specific wavelength. By Sharp I mean, that :
A) Resolution of the pattern is better.
B) No overexposure in certain regions of the spectrum
C) No Blurring of the spectrum image
I have attached a picture of absorbance graph of Carbon Nanotubes analysed by the Beckman Coulter DelsaMax PRO and one taken by Public lab spectrometer
The picture shown below is by DelsaMax PRO

The picture shown below is by Public Lab spectrometer

the graph for the one taken by PL was arrived at downloading the CSV file of the sample spectrum and tthe blank spectrum and then using Beer lamberts law, the absorbance values were achieved. This was done using the spreadsheet.
The Beer Lambert's Law given by 
A = log(Io/I)
where Io - Intensity value of the blank (Cuvette with DI water) spectrum(ie, the average value got from the CSV file)
I - intensity of the sample spectrum.
Here the base 10 logarithm is used.
The solution concentrations have been the same as the one shown by Beckman Coulter.
As you can see, there is a lot of noise that is present in the absorbance graph. 
Hence I would like to know what can I do in order to achieve  a more accurate graph.
