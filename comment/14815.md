[@abdul](/profile/abdul) I do have the 405nm UV laser pointer, but I find it's usefulness limited for certain applications. I originally I bought the Plab 2.5 spectrometer from Edmunds scientifics magazine, and I have modified it since then, the problem is in the kits portability. The 3.0 still has to pass some kind of spectral "muster," no one that I know of, has done any kind of analysis with it yet and posted any results here at Plab.

I think a kit with a built in universal light source would be an extremely marketable item.
