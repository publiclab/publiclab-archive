[Viewing source](view-source:http://nautilus.fis.uc.pt/st2.5/scenes-e/elem/e08294.html) on one of the datasets you can see the following, so we should be able to write an importer for these:

<pre>
<tr align=right><td>10</td>
<td></td>
<td>995.89</td>
<td>II</td>
</tr>
<tr align=right><td>6</td>

<td>1001.81</td>
<td>II</td>

<tr align=right><td>10</td>

<td>1016.61</td>
