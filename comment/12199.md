Hi Jeff. "Add a missing step" will work only for the author of the procedure. The comments section would always open up the opportunity to let the author know about anything (s)he might have missed.

This feature has been added to recognize the fact that all the testing procedures are not the same, some may require addition steps, and some might not require the ones we listed out (in which case, they can click on "Skip this step").

I was thinking like this. For procedures involving actually taking a scan, see the "Capture the spectrum and tag to this procedure" checkbox under live feed section? Once that is checked, the capture interface would appear as a <div> element in the place of the textarea we currently have, pushing it downwards. The spectrum can be captured & saved here (would make great sense once the macros module is implemented).

This is how it would probably look like. (Just rough drawing for the idea; Not all options like save, adjustments, tools are depicted here)

I like the idea of popping up the interface, and then close it again once done - but refrained from it to avoid popup blocking & managing issues. If that entails better usability, we can do that :)
