OK, we've finally gotten some good photos of the "basic kit" version of the [Community Microscope](/micro) ([Kickstarter link](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/the-community-microscope-kit/)) and how to assemble it. This is not the BEST lighting ever, but it allowed us to make the basic kit very cheap and simple, and it works /pretty well/ -- but of course, we are very much looking for ways to improve upon this, so chime in!

The advantages of this are that it uses everyday materials, is super inexpensive, and is relatively easy to reposition or replace. You can skip the tape and still make it work, but it's a bit harder to pin the clip over the clothes pin. 

A true goose-neck lamp as Katie has shown above is better, but the cheaper ones we've found don't have a fully articulated goose-neck, and we're not super satisfied with them. Any help finding a better one for <$5 would be much appreciated!
