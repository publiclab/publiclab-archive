Environment is the total sum and factors that contribute to your surroundings.  

Science is the study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.  

Abiotic are typically from the nonliving due to them not being derived from living organisms. 

While on the other hand, Biotic relates or results in living things.  

Population is a group of organisms of the same species populating a given area.  

Chemistry is the study of matter.
