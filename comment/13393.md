Hey All!

Okay, after a bunch of discussion last night, it seems that the above P-Mos circuit will work, but the battery leakage is significant.  And anyway, having diodes on the input lines is a good idea, in that it automatically selects the highest-voltage power input, and also protects folks again accidentally plugging the battery in the wrong way.

So I've implemented a new version of the design that reverts back to diode-based power selection.  But I've *also* added solder jumpers on the input lines, so one can get around the diodes, if one wishes.  So: best of both worlds :)

- Here's what solder jumpers look like on the back of the board (from an earlier version, won't match the current board layout):

Finally, I've added another solder jumper + cuttable trace combo so that one can bypass the LDO directly.  This allows one to power the 328p and the rest of the board directly with two AA alkaline batteries, and avoids any power drainage from the LDO.  This might be a nice option for some folks to really get maximum longevity in the field.  You can see the cuttable trace ("T1") here:

I've wrapped up a board design (0.1.7.1) that incoporates these elements, here:

Here's a close-up of the latest power (0.1.7.1) circuit:

Meanwhile, in order to hedge our bets, I've also finalized a "minimal fix" version of the board (0.1.3.2), that only fixes the wiring on the switch so that it works as intended for version 0.1.1 -- no other changes:

https://github.com/OpenWaterProject/riffle/blob/master/hardware/riffle-beta-0.1.0/riffle-beta-0.1.3.2-board.png

Looks like these designs are pretty solid at this point.  Will have to do some final thinking today about these solder jumper ideas, but as they shouldn't affect the default use of the board, I think they should be solid enough for this initial release.
