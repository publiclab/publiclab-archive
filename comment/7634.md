Hello Warren!  I have attached a screenshot of the "Configure" panel in the Capture interface using four different light intensities (at the very top of this thread).  They are labeled "pic10", "pic11", "pic12", "pic13" with the last file being at the lowest light intensity I can produce on my dimmer. 

I also attached pictures (at the very top) of my "countertop" spectrophotometer in case there is something wrong in the way I built the thing.  Any comments or help please????
