Hi, Thanks for your interest in Nuestros Suelos! We're in the process of producing materials about the kits' components. As soon as they're ready we are going to uploaded to our (still under construction) website: www.nuestrossuelos.cl . We are aso just starting a new phase of the project with people at RPI in Troy, NY. And Yes, we would love to connect with the kits initiative of Public Lab!
