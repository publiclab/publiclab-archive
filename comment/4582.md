The tools were using are getting easier and less time consuming to use - partially through our leaning from "less privileged" traditions like kite flying communities the world. I think your point on self confidence is a great one though. Its a common attitude that "scientists just know" what's right or wrong. or engineers. Still, an attitude that is eroding after things like the Fukushima disaster. 

a great contrast to kite mapping which puts things in some perspective is the drone community, which must be from a particular socioeconomic background due to the cost and complexity of their tools, but also has a different attitude -- borrowing some terms and perspectives from the military and defense world. 


I've heard complaints that the KAP community is primarily affluent white and male, but one thing that makes the public lab community different (perhaps) is the interest in low tech, "homebrew" solutions instead of threads to the top you see in the performance-oriented KAP community. ...the pride you see when someone figures out that you can use a common household material -- like exposed film - instead of an expensive, scientific grade filter.

anyhow, very thought provoking, as you can see from my rambling comment.
