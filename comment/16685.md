Thanks Ed,  

It's good to know there is hope for the Nano. That's an excellent thread you linked to. I might try removing the LED resistor and the regulator. Just removing the resistor reduces the sleep current by almost half. But trying to wake it up with the square wave could be beyond me. 

I'm doubtful about powering it with a boost converter. [I tried that with a Riffle](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/05-27-2016/riffle-campout) and the sensor data was really noisy. I assume the noise came from the converter.

If only they had made that shield for a Pro Mini and used a better RTC. I'm surprised someone has not recognized the value of such a device.
