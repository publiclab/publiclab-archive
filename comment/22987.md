Hi there! We are working with some folks from [Emapic](https://emapic.es) on an online solution for the data collected with the [Odo log 1.0](https://publiclab.org/notes/imvec/02-18-2018/odor-log-1-0). There's also [@sarasage](/profile/sarasage)'s [Odor complaint form](https://publiclab.org/notes/sarasage/08-29-2016/community-level-odor-mapping-site) ;)
