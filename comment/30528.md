The topic discussed this morning was endangered and threatened species what they were and examples of them were given. For a species to be considered endangered that certain species has to be on the verge of extinction. Extinction is the complete disappearance of a certain species of either plants or animals. Many ways species of plants and animals have gone to either become extinct or close to it in recent times was due to the actions of humans and our ignorance or careless attitude. 
Many examples were given today on endangered species and how they got to that stage was also explained. Examples of endangered species  shown today were the the key largo woodrat and the woodrat. The reason for the extinction of these animals was the Burmese Python being an invasive species due to human activities. The Burmese Python is also threatening another species that being the American Alligator all this resulting from the release of Burmese Pythons done by humans.
