Yay, data!!

Neat observation about the battery voltage and the temperature.  Makes me want to compare the rate of battery voltage drop to the temperature.  Perhaps:  smooth the battery voltage data (running average?) and take the derivative ... then plot that against temperature?   If that makes any sense.  If you attach the data from this experiment, I might try that out ...

In general, it'd be great to know how battery drain is impacted by temperature.

Also interesting re: not measuring the same point in the pile as it cooks.  I guess another approach could be to set up temperature probes at several fixed heights relative to the ground, along a pole ...

This is all making me recall Ned's beehive temperature monitoring idea ...
