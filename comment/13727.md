Can you try re-calibrating this one, as I think it was calibrated during a brief bug (it shows being calibrated on 1/26/16) which was since fixed. I hope that will fix at least one of your graphs: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/69433

I'm really not sure where those squiggles are coming from, though! Huh. Do they show up when you try to compare one of these spectra by adding them in the Compare interface?
