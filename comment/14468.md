Hey [@EMLangsurveying](/profile/EMLangsurveying), welcome to Public Lab! Thanks for publishing your first Research Note (test!). Could you fill in some more details to give this aerial a little more context, so other people know what they're looking at? Also, feel free to add some tags when you post so others can find it through related topics (for example "aerial-photography"). 

I'm really curious about the pathways people take through the landscape, made visible by the snowfall!
