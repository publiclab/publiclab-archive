The configuration with the stopper held in firmly with the threaded bottle cap looks really good. How hard is it to get that to work, i.e., to get the stopper to slide in just the right amount so the cap can thread on and hold it firmly? Maybe some grease could be used under the cap for an extra layer of waterproofing.
