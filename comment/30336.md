[@BIKIE-GERALD-24](/profile/BIKIE-GERALD-24), it was great to meet you on Open Call! Thanks so much for sharing your comprehensive analysis of these different aspects of the Cameroonian coast. 

I saw in your thesis that one of your recommendations is more infrastructure and collaboration on monitoring in the region. Are there any institutional or government efforts going in this direction? 

(I also added the tag `lang:fr` to your post because the thesis file you linked is in French)
