We had a Phonegap prototype going but they do not expose the raw video feed, but require the user to go through the camera widget, unfortunately. I'm hoping that when we make more progress on the iOS version we can backport some of that stuff to PhoneGap.

I'll spend some time on the rotation feature; I just fiddled with and improved the interface today, so there are a few more changes; 

I also hope the freezing will be fixed by Firefox soon -- they just pushed some new WebRTC changes out in an update. I also need some more testing phones :-)
