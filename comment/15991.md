Well, basically we just take the incoming image pixel by pixel, and for each of the input pixels, we plug their color values into the "infragrammar" expression provided, and assign the result to the outgoing pixel value (in monochrome). There's a bit more description here:

https://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram-sandbox

And the JS code is here: https://github.com/p-v-o-s/infragram-js/blob/master/public/infragram.coffee#L112-L124

The idea is to make a very very simple means to use textually-input math functions to transform images. So `r_exp()` (etc) is the provided function; we just wrap a simple expression like `R*G-23+B` in JavaScript.
