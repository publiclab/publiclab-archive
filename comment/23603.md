ðŸŽ‰ this is really nice. Thank you!

A great idea! 

Also, we have a subscription to this service: http://lookback.io which may help to identify further UI issues and bugs if we can do some outreach and test each page with a reasonable number of testers -- say 7-10. Perhaps this could be part of the plan too!

Thank you so much for your proposal, and to everyone who left useful comments!
