 [@warren](/profile/warren),   what is "helpful", as you know, depends on the intended use. Data from unknown and unsubstantiated sources can be unreliable depending on your purpose.  If what you want to do is "see" wind patterns I find the Wind Map at 
http://hint.fm/wind/
to be aesthetically and visually more than adequate.
