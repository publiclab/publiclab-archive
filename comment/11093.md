Guillaume,
Moving the entrance slit farther from the grating might help. I found that the grating does not have to be angled so sharply when the grating is farther from the slit. I found that as the distance increases, the grating angle has to be [decreased to get the sharpest diffraction pattern](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/2-12-2013/grating-angle-dvdr).

I have not tried to determine how varying the distance to the light source might affect the sharpness of the diffraction pattern.
