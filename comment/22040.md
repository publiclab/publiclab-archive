 Hi, Isha! There's a lot here, thank you, what a deeply thought-out proposal!

I have a few suggestions for starters -- first, what if we made this a pure JS library? So we basically handle CSVs as we do currently, which is that you can drag them in, and they display a graph. But all the code could be in JS to be run on the CSV in the browser! We could save the state (i.e. the choice of graph type, default time bounds, etc) in a string, kind of like an inline power tag: https://publiclab.org/n/15582

OR we could store the settings in the URL, as we do in Image Sequencer: https://sequencer.publiclab.org/examples/#steps=ndvi,colormap

This would modularize a lot of code away from the back-end in a clean way, and the library could be usable by other projects as well. What do you think?
