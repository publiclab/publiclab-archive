[@viechdokter](/profile/viechdokter) suggests that I'm proposing a 'gatekeeper' but that's too simplistic and I'm not. Sorry for any confusion from what I wrote. Sure, keep the existing open submit mode -- it is a great opportunity to welcome new ideas.

I'm suggesting that there needs to be a separate, yet directly visible, page(s) for 'reviewed' notes that original were in the general 'open' category. A new visitor would find recent notes but also a list of sub-topics where 'filtered' notes are placed. This allows the visitor to visually browse on-topic notes with sufficient documentation to be most helpful. In this case, search can only provide what has been pre-filtered by humans.
