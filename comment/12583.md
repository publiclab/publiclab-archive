[@gpenzo](/profile/gpenzo) the 2 ft. of chain would serve as the counter weight, then the chain would connect to a rope which is connected to an anchor.  the foam displacement alone should be able to support the 2 ft of chain, which is about 3 lbs.

Placement and visibility is a major concern.  It would have to be located outside of navigation channels and one would probably want to consult with the local governing authority--harbor master, state agency, and/or coast guard--before anchoring.  I agree that the chain getting wrapped around a prop is probably the greatest hazard to passing boats but it's not that much different from a mooring buoy or even a lobster buoy.  The coast guard approved reflective tape will help and a flashing beacon would be great but they are expensive.

It's a bit of a gamble but I think for the low coast approach, such as the Riffle sensor, you just have to accept that this bucket design has an inherent amount of risk whereby a crushing boat collision could sink the whole device.  It begs the question: how much do you want to pay to protect your low cost sensor?  

I considered putting another, smaller bucket (2 gal) inside the 5 gallon bucket and then filling the annular space with foam but it seems like overkill.  Yet, if one were going to deploy more expensive instruments then you probably would want to invest in a metal framed buoy to protect them--and that would be fun to build too but much more expensive.
