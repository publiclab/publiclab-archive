 Hi [@divyabaid16](/profile/divyabaid16)
i really liked the way you divided your work in timeline. It's managed and arranged well.
But I was curious regarding this 
`Here I have interchanged the 2 columns, i.e placing the map towards the right, since in all other pages, the map is placed towards the right`
Can I have some insight on this ?
