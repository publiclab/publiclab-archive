Hi [@wln215](/profile/wln215) , I just spotted this question and wanted to at least respond in appreciation for you for answering other people's questions. ðŸ™‚ 
I have trusted Adafruit's supply chain although honestly I may not have noticed if any temperature chip that i may have received through them may have had an temperature offset outside the advertised Â±0.5 Â°C band.
Has this issue affected any of your hardware?
