Performing a custom white balance on a blue-filtered NIR camera fools the camera into exaggerating the brightness of the red channel. The red channel is used for information about NIR light. Although modified consumer cameras are sensitive to NIR light, they are much more sensitive to blue light. To get a measurement of the proportion of NIR to blue in the sunlight reflected from foliage, you need equally sensitive devices measuring each, or you can arbitrarily exaggerate one so the proportion is closer to what it should be. That is what the custom white balance does and it must be done in a way that fools the camera in a certain way. A gray card will not do that, but any very blue surface could work. The surface must reflect a lot of blue light, or you can use some other source of blue light: https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/11-22-2013/white-balance-for-all
