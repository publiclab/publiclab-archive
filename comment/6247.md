Hi Philip,
This is very interesting and timely. California is now experiencing a huge boom in Hydraulic Fracturing, a practice that employs water and chemicals  injected into oil or gas wells to release trapped oil and gas in shale rock layers. Based on much publicity about horror stories of contaminations in ground waters and air at thousands of fracking sites with longer history, such as Wyoming, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Texas.  People are truly concerned.  Wonder if your method can be used to monitor water quality of ground water, such as in wells, or coming out of faucets?
My startup, WattminderInstruments.com is building a very low-cost platform to facilitate area, monitoring of contamination of groundwater, as well as air where fracking operations exist.  We'd love to collaborate with you and any organization with similar interest.
