Ned,

Our company is supposed to be writing an article for Vision System Design magazine regarding uses for dual band filters. I realize that the red filter is not a dual band filter, but none-the-less would like to possibly include subject matter that you address here and put it in the article. I do not feel particularly qualified to write about this subject. We have time constraints as well. Would you possibly be interested in contributing to this portion of the article as an author and photographer as well? If the asnswer is "maybe" and you would like to discuss it, I can be reached at 847-359-3550 x103. Thanks in advance for giving this some consideration... Barry Warzak
