Hello Mathew, 

Thanks for sharing some of your insights of solar heated balloons. I totally agree with you that wind is one of the major limitations. I have been working on the design to withstand the wind. My mission is to fly in the morning time usually (9-11 am ) which has normally less wind. Also, this time is also the best time for flights with an NDVI camera as the sun is nearly at Zenith.

I designed a model of solar heated balloon with payload of 100 gm which can embed Modified Mobius Action Cam. Regarding pigmenting, i have tried charcoal mixture which subsequently increased the solar absorption rate. Similarly, the rope configuration that i designed seems to be slightly more withstanding wind speed than the normal configuration. I will share the design in the public labs soon within a month as i have other deadlines coming very soon. 

I too haven't tried  static charging the balloons or charcoal but i would love to try it out. Can you share me some more contents on it.

My main vision behind solar heated balloons is to make a more scalable model that can be integrated to light weight action camera modified for infrared spectrum and together with automatic image recognition and image processing pipelines; provide a cheap affordable precision agriculture tool for farmers belonging to developing countries like Nepal, India, Tanzania, etc. 

Lets keep in touch, share and make the discussion going.

I would like to apologize for my late response. 

Best ,
