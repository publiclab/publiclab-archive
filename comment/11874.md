This project might be of interest for finding a solution for the calibration problem:

https://jethomson.wordpress.com/spectrometer-articles/how-to-build-a-spectroscope/

It describes an amplitude calibration called "Determining the System Function" that corrects the effect of the RGB filter of the camera sensor (similar approach as suggested by Dave Stoft) plus a subsequent radiometric calibration using a separate light sensor. This allows quantitative measurements of spectral irradiance. All code for the calibrations is also available. 
Perhaps it is possible to add an economic light sensor to the DIY kit to get independent light measurements e.g. this one:
