Thanks for sharing [@lukoyedith](/profile/lukoyedith), have you submitted this on the Outreachy website? The deadline is Monday 4pm UTC.

I love the research you have done on each section and the suggestion of leveraging already existing tools and gems. 

I tried clicking a few links on the page but it seems the whole proposal is an image format?

For the listing of draft items, since that page is accessible to other users, an alternative could be listing the draft under the user's drop-down that displays their profile, logout..etc...that could be an option...


For content moderation and spam filtering, you mentioned adding a gem, Rakismet, but have not mentioned exactly what it does..

In the proposal, I haven't seen you mention other items that were mentioned under the Education-related project such as,

i) Separate author names with commas instead of “with”
ii)Include high-relevance usernames you’ve used recently, or who are recently active on the site, in autocompletion results while typing into, for example, comment boxes

have a comprehensive look here https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/9257

Other items to think about is creating FTOs(first timer only issues) from the project, tests, and accessibility.

All the best! And thank you!
