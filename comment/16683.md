That lack of alarm is pretty irritating considering that the 1337 has them built in, and they could have simply used that chip instead. Watchdog timers work ok for jumping through short sleeps, but you could also try setting the SQW frequency to 1Hz, and then use that output as an interrupt alarm on rising or falling. Every time you wake, increment a counter and compare it to the number of seconds you want to stay asleep sleep, and set a flag if you have reached that many wakeup/seconds.

My guess (?) is that you should be able to put the FT232 into some kind of USB suspend mode, or perhaps by pulling one of the pins low? Otherwise I would look at ch340 based nano clones to see if their uart goes into sleep modes more easily. There is a post with some other tips on the Arduino forum:
