no, that's right - sorry, it's "publiclab" by default for the WiFi password on `pi-builder` -- is that what you're looking for?

> So I downloaded the artifact.zip file from GitHub (job# 121890022) I extracted the files, and successfully flashed the img to my micro SD card. I fired up my Raspberry Pi Zero W, everything started loading up as expected, then it asked for an ID and password which I don't have. I didn't see anything about an ID and password being needed for start up, only for the wifi cam. However, I still tried that ID and password, as well as attempted to use the default ID and password for Raspberry Pi of pi and raspberry respectively, but still no access. What should I be using, or did I grab the wrong img file?
