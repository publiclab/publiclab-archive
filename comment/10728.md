I was wondering if we could add this as a feature to http://Infragram.org (and potentially MapKnitter in the future!) by writing a JavaScript Canvas module that removes lens distortion from an image. 

I might've thought to do it in the same way we use Canvas to distort (https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/blob/master/public/cartagen/src/warper/image.js#L344)

but these days, we might be able to write a WebGL module to do it even faster. 

This person has ported a lens distortion shader (http://devlog-martinsh.blogspot.ca/2011/10/glsl-cubic-lens-distortion.html) to WebGL:

The shaders are here: https://github.com/mattdesl/filmic-gl/tree/master/demos/shaders

hmmm! I don't know webgl well, but it seems promising?
