This makes six cable penetrators for:
$3.27 + $2.77 + rubber washers + glue for sealing the wires inside the pipes 

But regular 3/8" hex nuts are cheaper and should work better.

Lowes has brass nipples, eight for $2.98 <http://www.lowes.com/pd_46816-1811-905L_1z0vitnZ1z135ut__>  
Or you could use the threaded tube from those discarded Presta valves.
