> I participated as part of the Disaster Response Team last summer after the Baton Rouge area floods -- it's a worthwhile thing to volunteer to do (recording High Water Marks). I can connect folks with Shandy from LFMA if you're interested!

> if you are really interested in floodplain monitoring, people's houses, insurance, etcm LFMA professionals have a volunteer Disaster Team that rushes in to measure flooding on homes for the NFIP.
