I was thinking of adding the spectrum tag to the procedure (as it may so happen that the user may want to retrospectively write procedures). 
I didn't get the "run the procedure" multiple times part. Can you please tell me more?
Yes, I am keeping track of the state of the procedure, so that the user could pickup at the last unfinished step. We could add an autosave feature, if need be.

In the present design, the capture happens in the procedure dashboard itself, so I don't think the redirect part is applicable. (or did I miss something? :-o)
