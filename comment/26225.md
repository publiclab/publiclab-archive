Hi, [@Meculus](/profile/Meculus) and [@macapola](/profile/macapola) - the other element that may be causing trouble is the light. If you are right up against the slide, almost touching, that's a good start, but also be sure that your light source is a single point, not ambient or multiple LEDs, and try using it in a dark room.

Also try holding the light steadily at different distances above your sample, which may help as well. I hope this helps! Focusing and lighting at high magnifications can be tough!
