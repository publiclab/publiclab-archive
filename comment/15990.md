I think this should now be possible with [webjack-firmata](https://github.com/publiclab/webjack-firmata) and one of these nice cheap "Arduino Nano" third-party boards you can now get on Amazon:

$7.59 each: https://www.amazon.com/Solu-Atmega328-Arduino-compatible-Beginners-Download/dp/B00SISJSPE/

$22 for 5: https://www.amazon.com/XCSOURCE-ATmega328P-Controller-Arduino-TE359/dp/B015MGHH6Q/

These take the cheaper "ch341" usb chips, so you need the extra driver here:

```
USB Chip driver: http://www.wch-ic.com/download/list.asp?id=126 

They are available here: 

* USB CH341/CH340 WINDOWS98/ME/2000/XP/Server 2003/VISTA/, Server 2008/Win7/Win8 32/64 --- http://www.5v.ru/zip/ch341ser.zip 
* USB CH341/CH340 LINUX --- http://www.5v.ru/zip/ch341ser_linux.zip 
* USB CH341/CH340 MAC OS32,MAC OS64 --- http://www.5v.ru/zip/ch341ser_mac.zip

```

This could be nice because you can just read in the data via the audio jack on a webpage, even from a smartphone (see the demo on the webjack repository here: https://github.com/publiclab/webjack#plotting)
