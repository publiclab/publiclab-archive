[@sspatharioti](/profile/sspatharioti) so nice to see this coming together. I took a try at it and I only had wordsmith stuff. Wasn't sure about the term "overflight observer" and also the word "HIT" for submitting at end. I think there still needs to be a photo example for when water appears rippled and shiny, but is not sheen. May have to ask GRN about that since that is my main problem in identifying sheen. I really liked the jellyfish example!
