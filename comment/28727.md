I would encourage you to keep looking for mercury in soil.  However, mercury is a difficult element to analyze safely and very dangerous to handle.  There are ways to safely analyze for it safely- like EDXRF ( energy dispersive X-Ray flouresence).  There are the hand held analysis "guns" that can be rented to safely analyze mercury (or Hg).    Although the rental fee is not cheap.  Good job!
