I love this framework, thank you!! 

I guess though that I wonder what prevents a learner's tool from being a user's tool -- thinking of Scratch here -- and whether all users of tools are learners and remain so through most of their usage of a tool. That doesn't affect your framing of these four types, of course, but it might have bearing on PL methods -- one difference might be whether a learner's tool is not flexible enough to be used beyond a learning context?
