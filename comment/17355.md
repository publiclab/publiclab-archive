Hi Juanjo, 

It would be good to see some photos from your archaeological missions, including more of the cool kite and how you attach the camera. Also how you are using a drone. You can post a research note (click "Write a research note" above) and drag photos into it. If you have a really big photo mosaic you can drag that into a note and it will display smaller but if people open it in a new tab it will be full size. Or you could upload the full resolution version to a photo sharing site (e.g., Flickr) and embed it or link to it, or just put a smaller version in the research note. 

It is also good to hear what you think about the pros and cons of kites and drones. For many applications drones will eventually displace kites as the best way to lift a camera, but for now there might be some advantages of kites.

Thanks,
Chris
