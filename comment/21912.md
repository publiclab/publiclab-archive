 First off, spectrometers are much more common than spectrophotometers, these days.  And cheaper too.  

T he method you referenced relies heavily on liquid/liquid extraction.  So you will need separately funnels ( and please read up on how to vent them), a hood for using the chloroform, as well as some good gloves that are chloroform resistant.   The method also used some cyanides, which are hard to get in the US, although the paper lists other alternatives.
For a first pass, sample the water and let the residue settle out.  You may have to let it sit overnight.  If you still have residue, you can filter the water through a coffee filter.  
The base outline of the method is water sample in Sep funnel.  Do multiple seps with dithizone(save dithzone) until dithizone is green.  Then    you do the saved dithizone / water reagent Sep funnel extract ( again remember to vent).  This time, save the water reagent.  Then it's the water reagent into the proper dithizone reagent in a Sep funnel and shake again.  This time save the dithizone.  It should be discolored.  For lead, they say the color is violet.  To me, it was more like a deep blue. 
With proper pH and buffer, you can probably do more than one element at a time.  Then the spectral data processing takes place.   But it takes a lot of time to get there!  Please double check me, but I think that's correct ( from USP 251).
