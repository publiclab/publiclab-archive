It has been strange to track FEMA over the years.  Initally, say 30 years ago, they said you needed three days of food and water.  Then it changed to a week's worth of food and water.  After some of the recent disasters ( say Puerto Rico), that is on the low side. 

We lost power for a week in the middle of winter.  There was no way we could afford a generator.  We did OK with hurricane lamps and kerosene heaters.  But still, it feels like a lot is missing.  Thank you for your work.
