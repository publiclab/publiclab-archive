Hi, I was doing a research on California waste management and stumbled upon this work. The issue is the link doesn't work.

What i am working on is i have identified 23 processing facilities and wanted to know the data related to what goes in and what goes at a very granular level. 

Let me know if anyone has this data or can point me in the direction. 

P.S. I have already gone through CalRecycle website and i don't find the data. For reference please find attached file
<a href="/i/42650"><i class="fa fa-file"></i> Data_Required.xlsx</a>

Thanks in Advance,

Stay Safe
