Thanks [@kkoerner](/profile/kkoerner)! For the air purifier, pulsing pumps are a-ok as we are not trying to move air through the roots in a precisely known way, just a general way.  So the more inexpensive options work well. The only thing is we will want as quite of a pump as possible or to build an enclosure that makes it as quiet as possible. thats why the whisper pumps are pretty decent as they are like $7 and nearly silent. they are super bulky for shipping, as you mention. I wonder if that's the price we pay for the sound mitigation? (also are you still with CAC? I'd love to see what y'all are working on if you have any links)

Thanks [@Zengirl2](/profile/Zengirl2) it would be great to see your container research note! I just met a nice designer in paris who maybe potentially would want to work with us on thinking about the pot/enclosure. also mentioned [@warren](/profile/warren) 's idea bout randomization at some talks recently and everyone wants us to make it happen!
