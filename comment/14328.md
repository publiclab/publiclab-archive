Not to worry, I too find bits to revise after I publish; what counts is fixing the details as they appear. One thought on visualization. When I do comparisons of common factors between different tests, I find it easier to visualize those differences by plotting on the same graph so the Y scale is the same. It can be less helpful when the absolute values are quite different but often with things like %noise, %error, etc. RGB color curves on the same plot is easier for the eyes ;-)
