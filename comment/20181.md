It's actually been tested for that-- it will certainly catch bugs, but anything larger has been able to successfully avoid it (ducks, fish, eels), and it can only be used at speeds where animals, even insects, can swim back out. If they are neuston insects that float around, they survive the netting and you can pick them out of the sample. 
Larger, faster trawls like the manta ray crush fish that are caught because of the pressure in the net at high speeds. BabyLegs is too small and slow for that.
