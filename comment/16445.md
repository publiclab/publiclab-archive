Thank you so much for the idea on using heatshrink material as a material for making the slit. This is better than paper or cardboard because it did not leave any fibers behind. To cut the slit I just used an exacto knife and then slightly widened it but shaving away small slivers from the inside. So it is hard to create a specific width but it is possible to keep the slit width very narrow. You can check for the quality of the cut by holding up in the light.
