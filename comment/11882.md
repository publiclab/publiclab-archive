Can i get a 250ml pipette? My choice of graduated cylinder volume was based on a desire to make the time period I measured long enough that my reaction time would be about 1% of the time period.  I could use a smaller, more accurately graded glass pipette but I worry I'm increasing the accuracy of my volume measurement at the expense of the accuracy of my timed measurement.
