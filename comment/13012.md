Wow, so many good thoughts ....

### soldering & accessibility

It's a good point that it'd be nice for the kit to be useful without requiring any soldering.  Given the sort of manufacturing processes we're considering, the only parts that will require soldering on this board will be "through-hole" parts -- parts with pins that go through the board.  We are using a through-hole 2x7 connector for the pins at the end of the board in order to make it mechanically more stable; I had been thinking that we might just ship the board with that part separately, as is standard for any of the parts from Sparkfun or Adafruit.  The main reason for this is that paying someone to do the 'through hole' soldering, which isn't easy to do with a robot, tends to be more expensive. But I really don't know the details on that.  E.g. the Arduino Uno has through-hole parts; I don't know what manufacturing process they use.  Perhaps we could ask MacroFab how much it would cost to have through-hole parts soldered?

If we want some functionality to be available 'out of the box', we could  load the board with code that measures the temperature from the on-board RTC, which has a thermistor, and records it to an on-board uSD card.  That way, the device is useful immediately as a temperature datalogger. 

We could also look for alternative connectors on the board that don't require soldering.  I'll do a quick check into that.  

[@tonyc](/profile/tonyc) -- Do we have an idea for a AA battery holder that lies flat, connects to a JST connector, and doesn't require soldering?  Perhaps we could use wire-twisting, and tape?

Another option to have something ready 'out of the box' would be to ship a [small, flat lipo battery](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1570)

The numbers are rough for me still, but I think that we should still be able to easily get something like 1000 hours of temp measurements out of a 100 mAh battery, for applications where we make a quick measurement every 10 minutes and sleep in-between.   

### FONA

[@pdhixenbaugh](/profile/pdhixenbaugh) -- spot-on exactly what I was hoping to try next :)  It looks like for measuring turbidity we'll want to be submerged at least a few feet underwater, so it'd be good to see if we effectively waterproof a water bottle with a cable sticking out of the bottle and going up to an antenna at the surface ... maybe with a little flotation device to keep it above water?
