I was thinking today of the idea from a couple years ago of reimplementing full map export in the client side, and had a thought -- these matrix transforms could be reused in WebGL, which is saved to a virtual pixel buffer (a canvas). This could be downloaded as a PNG, if the browser can handle that... 

It was interesting to me that for reasons I don't really understand, most rubbersheeting in the GIS tradition uses polynomial transforms with GCPs, which are run (in GDAL, or ImageMagick, for example) on the CPU. One reason our warping is so fluid and fast is that it's run on the GPU, as is WebGL. So because we've taken a different (and as Justin explains above, more commonsense) approach to "undoing the perspectival distortions in our images," we may be able to take advantage of the GPU -- and of client-side rendering -- to do the heavy lifting of exporting, or merging, maps into large rasters. This would make the Mapknitter project much more scalable and efficient, if we could pull it off! 

We could call it **gdal.js**, maybe?
