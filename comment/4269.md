I'm curious about how you derived your data.  Did you look at the height of the green peak at about 550 nm and compare that among samples?  Did you use the average value from the graph at Spectral Workbench or did you look at the values for the individual color channels (under "More tools" "Toggle RGB")? I wonder if using just one of the color channels would give you a different result. Unfortunately, the green channel is maxed out at that peak in some of the spectra. Did you try comparing more than one peak?

The spectra you produced are well resolved and nicely calibrated.

Is this a project for the Instrumental Analysis course in the Chemistry Department at Centre College in Kentucky?
