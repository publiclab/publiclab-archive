Actually [@stevie](/profile/stevie) and [@natalie](/profile/natalie) are sourcing new bottles right now, maybe you can get in on the order. We're hoping to switch to nail polish bottles, and Stevie found a good place to buy them already... Stevie, did you have a chance to post them on the wiki page Natalie mentioned? 

Cuvettes, although they are what are used in labs, kind of suck -- amazingly they leak! And are way overpriced. The nail polish bottles are ~$0.50 each.

I want an octopus-shaped laser!!! I've used some of those funny-shaped ones to spread the laser out more, since although it's less bright, it means it's easier to line up with the spectrometer slit. 

We're also talking about using UV LEDs, so that may be an option too, although we haven't been able to get them as bright as the laser, using "bouncer" flashlights.
