[@Tehnicni](/profile/Tehnicni), I'd agree that any detector-specific non-linearity is likely very small compared with the effect you've presented. I'd guess the more likely cause is camera-internal firmware-applied compression -- so non-linearity of the camera output data due to internal processing. The green peak shows clear compression in the upper graph. Seems like the camera is attempting to soft-compress to reduce visual artifacts of hard compression. Compression can be helpful for typical web-video use but not helpful for spectrometers. If the camera exposure control (AGC) can be turned off that helps. Otherwise, 1) take care to avoid obvious (visual) signs of compression from high-level signals and 2) average the more-linear output at lower levels -- and/or choose a more controllable camera.
