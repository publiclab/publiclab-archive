[@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) Thank you for you comments! I so didn't think of regulatory issues attached to the kits and I'm not sure if there is a difference on how the sample is collected, if you are doing the work yourself from collecting and testing it- which is my case. In terms of regulatory issues, I need to check with whom I doing this for.
