 [@namangupta](/profile/namangupta) Thank you for your review and suggestions. The answers to your doubts are

 I will be displaying the recent/most viewed blogs and not all the blogs. Say recent 6 blogs or something like that which will contribute to the good user experience. 
 
Yes, you are right we can have a place to show trending posts. I can place then on the sidebar which will also help in filling up the extra space on the side bar.

Regarding the modal idea, it will be opened only when the user clicks on "ask a question". A user can visit the questions page for reading other answers or searching for particular answers. 

Thank you so much for your feedbacks. I will revise my proposal and try adding more features which can further enhance the user experience.
