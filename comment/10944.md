Thanks Greg, that helps a lot. I'm just getting a feeling for how complicated the fluorescence measurements are. It looks like fluorescence will be key to your measure of "Photosystem II and Photosystem I efficiency" and also maybe "Photosynthetic regulation" and the combined photosynthesis measure. I could not figure out at what wavelength you will be measuring fluorescence -- will it be the same for all of the different fluorescence measurements?

I assume you are measuring fluorescence in the infrared. In the [FAQ](http://blog.photosynq.org/multispeq-measurements/) you state that "Fluorescence, in the case of photosynthesis, is infrared light emitted by the sample in response to being hit with some other wavelength of light." It seems that most of the fluorescence of chlorophyll is not quite infrared, but just long red, with peaks at 690 nm and 740 nm. Below is one example for chlorophyll a in methanol.

I remember vividly in the first biology class I ever took a demonstration of chlorophyll fluorescence under UV illumination which looked exactly like this:

The red in the flask above is from that peak at 690 nm. The professor in that biology class explained that the photons emitted from the excited atoms were lower energy (longer wavelength) than the absorbed UV photons due to the second law of thermodynamics (some energy was lost in the transfer). I went up after class and reminded him that the laws of thermodynamics did not apply at the atomic level (I guess I haven't changed much).  I wonder if he remembers that moment as well as I do 35 years later (Me: "I guess I impressed him." Him: "Wise-ass kid better watch his step.").
