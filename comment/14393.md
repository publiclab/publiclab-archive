I think that [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) has a good point...or set of points.

One slight modification would be to put weights on the users and rankings.  A combination of the user's own reputation and the scoring system.  That way a "friends Mark you up" scenario has a much smaller effect than a recognized expert going one way or another.

Alternatively a truly useful piece of work can rise up by popular acclaim.

Even better, the work load is more distributed...public lab employees don't have to grind through their review queue every day, but they could adjust a reviewer's weight to moderate the system.

From a search result and sorting perspective this is just an additional attribute to be used to rank results.

This could work well with requests for review and verification or replication.  Additional weights that modify the relevance of research and results.
