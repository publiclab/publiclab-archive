Warren,

We did use a compact fluorescent bulb to calibrate, although I wonder at
the effectiveness of this approach: fluorescent bulbs each emit a slightly
different spectrum due to their having slightly different chemical 
compositions from bulb to bulb. This can be evidenced simply by holding 
a prism up to your eye and observing the bulbs in a room lit 
by overhead fluorescent light. This being said, I'm not sure there's a 
logical alternative...oh well.

I don't know how to link you to our calibration spectra without linking inside 
my account. My apologies, I'm new to the PLOTS community.
