This is really great feedback, and excellent for others looking to assemble the kit. Great work, and thanks for sharing, Carl!

I had to go back + remove the silt-filter and reposition the webcam to catch the correct light path. This might be solved by drilling + tapping a lego and including a screw to adjust the tilt of the webcam. 5) Ive got a protocol for removing the aluminum foil which might be reproducible Im picking up more DVDs today to give it a try 6) Alignment from the slit-filter to the webcam seems to be the biggest problem currently. 7) Purchasing a CFL bulb has been a challenge as well. 8) Final alignment ( light source \>\> slit-filter \>\> webcam ) is still up in the air. Not sure how complex its going to be
