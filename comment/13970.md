Hi bhickman, 

 I am glad I found your site this week. Well, I should have found your inventions earlier.  Quite helpful instuctions, and bill of materials. Thanks.

 As I am a total novice in this lab instrumentation, I would like to give it a try as your suggestions.  However, I am not quite familiar with the TI evaluation kit, nor programming languages. 
Therefore I would like to try as almost exactly as yours. 
I have tried a series of Arduino product family.
 Is there any possibility for me to employ an Arduino family board instead of the Texas Instrument kit? 
Would the Arduino be compatible with all your github softwares.
I am considering Arduino Due, which supplies 12 bit resolution AD conversion function.
Thank you again for your contributions.
