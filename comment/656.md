So I just tried a batch of images here from our campus where I work and it solved the composite with only one obvious error in the middle of the road.  It looks great and the resulting jpeg is 6.5 MB, but when imported into MapKnitter, the resulting resolution is only 8 cm per pixel.  That might be correct, based on the downsampling that appears to have occurred, but it should be higher given that the jpeg has all the data and the balloon was only 500 feet off the ground, tops.

I'll ask Jeff his thought about this MapKnitter 10 MB question.
