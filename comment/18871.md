Hi, this is fantastic, thank you! In your list of endpoints, which I really appreciate, which are existing legacy functions which would be updated, and which are new? Could you indicate the current URL for legacy ones (sourcing from https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/master/doc/API.md) and the new URL it'd be available at? 

Please also check out my comments about the statistics API and other considerations in this comment -- https://publiclab.org/notes/Raounak/02-21-2018/gsoc-proposal-v2-api-development#c18864

Thanks a lot! Don't forget to take a look at related proposals by [@milaaraujo](/profile/milaaraujo), [@stefannibrasil](/profile/stefannibrasil), [@Raounak](/profile/Raounak), and [@rishabh07](/profile/rishabh07) -- and reach out to talk with them about their proposals too! [#soc-2018-api](/tag/soc-2018-api)

Thanks for all your great work in contributing already! Very much appreciated. :-)
