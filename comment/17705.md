I think we should distinguish between tags and topics. I think, while we still don't use the word "topic" widely on the site, we have the opportunity to be very selective and concrete with what is deemed a "topic." This might save a headache later. 

For tag groupings, I agree with Liz that it would be really great to have a way to group and view that is not related to chronology. I'd love to see primary landing pages that are *always* at the top, and those can have links to wikis and research notes etc. Perhaps a landing page could have a section on common tags associated with this topic, etc.
