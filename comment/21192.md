Ooh, I'm just catching up on this thread, but this is really interesting! I have a bunch of the webcams similar to the one we're selling as an upgrade option at home (some that are in various stages of being pulled apart), and many of them seem to have the IR filter outside of the lens barrel--- I'll take a look at some of them this weekend to see if I can figure out which is which. The webcams we're selling as upgrades have a standard mount that should allow for use of different lenses (these can be purchased separately and are pretty affordable) so it's possible destroy a lens here and there without having to replace the whole camera each time (the upgrade cams can take a *little* bit of a beating). I'll see what I can figure out over the long weekend and update here next week. Really interested to see how this project evolves!
