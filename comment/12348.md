       Are there any bubbles in the sign board where you mount the wings to the bottle? Did you get all of the bubbles out of the syringe?

The close-up image below shows how the perforated sign board fits with the bottle.  I split the extreme edge of the wings where they meet the bottle surface to make a tighter fit.

Per the official instructions on seaglide.net, I always hold the glider face-down in the water for two complete cycles in order to ensure the syringe expels any air and fills up with water.  In theory, this should also ensure any air doesn't get trapped in the wing holes either.

Considering the Glider has been tumbling from the back-end over the front, there's a good chance that the tail is indeed the culprit!  I've tried various tail configurations but with the last one I wrapped the sign-board material with plastic tape to secure it.  There's a good chance that this created air pockets!  

     . Is the water you are "flying" in brackish?

The location of my dive is in Potts Harbor/Casco Bay, Maine (Latitude: 43.738511 | Longitude: -70.021706).  While I've never done a proper salinity sample (thats a great idea though!) the water here is salty enough that we regularly make our own sea salt by evaporating a seemingly small amount of water.  I've always guessed this was because there are no significant fresh water sources in a relatively enclosed natural harbor area, but thats anything but a scientific conclusion.  In any case, the salt water would explain why the official recommended ballast weight seems to be too light! From the looks of it, the Seaglide has mostly been tested in lakes and rivers, so it would be a safe guess that the waters of Casco Bay would require more ballast! 

In preparation for my next dive, I've cut the wings to the small, square pattern shown in the official instructions and will attempt to match the ballasting recommendations as closely as possible.  This way I'll have a good control to test any further modifications.  The one major difference is I'll probably leave out the tail piece altogether.

Results will be posted shortly!
