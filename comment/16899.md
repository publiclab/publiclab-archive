Hi Chris, thanks a bunch! I'm hoping we can work on developing out an activity of two for people to do in first experimenting with data loggers as a number of people will be getting the Riffle soon. I think it would be neat to have a couple things people could try out with different data logger.  We're bringing along a nano and a mini-pearl to the Regional Barnraising. I like the idea of using the temperature sensor as a first attempt. I found [@pdhixenbaugh](/profile/pdhixenbaugh) post on an activity like this. Seems like a good one to model.  https://publiclab.org/notes/pdhixenbaugh/10-20-2016/riffle-and-thermsistor
