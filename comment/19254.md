Hi [@SimonPyle](/profile/SimonPyle) hope all is well! Wanted to connect you to [@tech4gt](/profile/tech4gt) who is working on a process like this for microscope slide images. Here's a post we've been chatting on https://publiclab.org/notes/amirberAgain/01-12-2018/python-and-opencv-to-analyze-microscope-slide-images-of-airborne-particles#c19238 with [@amirberAgain](/profile/amirberAgain) and [@dakoller](/profile/dakoller)
