**Session idea**:  Is a [NASA AeroPod](https://technology.nasa.gov/patent/GSC-TOPS-10) or a [KAPtery SkyPod](https://publiclab.org/tag/skypod-gps-logger) a more appropriate data logger for collecting data during kite flights? (2 hours)

We might have a NASA AeroPod at LEAFFEST, and we will definitely have some SkyPods. None of us has ever flown an AeroPod so we could try to fly both with kites and learn something about their relative capabilities.
