Hey Chris - yep, the different groups developing these projects; i'd love to design t-shirts!

Modularizing and annotating code can go a very long way to ensuring reusability across platforms. If each team keeps their sensor-specific code clearly separated from the data-logging code, reusability should be possible. 

I'm happy to help with this -- some approaches are:

* use comment lines to mark sensor-specific sections of code: `// -------- start conductivity probe code ---------- //`
* group code by purpose, and maintain a consistent API (say, wrap code in a function with named parameters) so that copying it into another file is easier, and you don't have to disentangle board-specific bits, so instead of a series of interleaved statements, you can use a standard function like `getConductivityData()`
* you can separate code out into different files, which adds a little complexity in one sense, but helps maintain modularity and makes copying much easier

If we can list the different code examples we're working with here, i'm happy to suggest (and contribute pull requests for!) ways of modularizing!
