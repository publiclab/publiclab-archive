Lots of interesting stuff here... A couple thoughts:

* iframes aren't searchable and do not archive the content in the PL database, and if the host site disappeared...
* I think we may actually have a REST API, since rails often autogenerates one. If we don't, its only a few lines of code. 

I'm not sure what the size of the audience is who are going to want to use git to write research notes, but if we have a REST way to post & update, people could pretty easily code up scripts to integrate with a git repo. 

There are some great longer research notes out there of course, but one reason I like shorter ones especially is that they encourage people to break up their work into more digestible pieces, which makes for more regular sharing of work instead of saving up work for days or weeks before posting. That in turn creates more openings for others to get involved, critique, suggest changes or improvements.
