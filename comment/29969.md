We did two group projects, making an representative bottle and making posters of issues microplastics are causing. The bottles are suppose to represent how our rive, specifically the Mississippi river, looks and how microplastics are damaging our ecosystem. The bottles also suppose to have a storyline. Our group's storyline focused on microplastic endangering sea life.  In the bottle we used our own materials we caught in the Mississippi river when finding microplastics. Then added other materials around the classroom. We even decorated the outside of our bottle.
Our next group project was stating what specifically microplastics are causing, climate change is what we choose. The production of plastic would add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, in which greenhouse gases are main cause of climate change.
