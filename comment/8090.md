Jeff -- ah, I see -- good point!  I don't think I'm finding the proper Visualight schematic ... file:///home/chronos/user/Downloads/strip_02-schematic.pdf  -- do you happen to have a link to the files / bill of materials / etc for their subboard?  or the voltage required to drive the LED?  I think we could just use a boost or buck converter on a lower / higher voltage battery to get the desired voltage -- I haven't designed this sort of power circuitry before, but Rui's a great local guru I can consult ... 

Glad you like my illustrations!  (I totally cheated on the hand bit with some clipart from the web, though :))
