Ouch, micromanagement is a little harsh! Sounds like a suggestion for encouraging posts for the new activity grid feature. I'm thinking about this in general as well: RN content is showing up in new places, should there be a place to encourage posters to write titles a certain way? what's the goal behind this, as in what would we be looking for, descriptive and searchable? If we do encourage titles to have certain features, how do we encourage this (in the publishing process, in the comments here etc.)?

"what is in a name...?" :) +1 brainstorming, 

sorry [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) to take over your RN for posting ideas. love the rig! tis beautiful!
