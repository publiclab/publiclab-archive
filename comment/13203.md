Thank you for sharing this very nice project! In a comparable climate zone in southern Sweden we must have more earthworms (eating the dead leaves) or less deciduous trees as there are a lot of moss in the woods. Perhaps less oak... Either way, I enjoyed your scientific approach!

God fortsättning (merry continuation [of the holiday season])
