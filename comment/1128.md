It's a 1.3ppm minimum. Ive been talking to Matthew (Rhus) and the tubes that we're using aren't going to be strong enough to sense in salt marshes, we'd need to hook them up to one of the pumps. He's going to post some links to what levels in marshes might potentially be. Scott has tubes and film canisters though in case there is a release at a refinery.

Jeff- maybe we can revisit putting together a H2S sensor for calibrating? We'd just need to determine the levels for marshes. 

I'm worried that light "pollution" is causing some of the coloration in the paper and think that we should keep trying in marshes in different conditions, but also should do a paralel test in an area that has no H2S to see if the paper still changes color. One of the next steps before we do any more field tests I think.
