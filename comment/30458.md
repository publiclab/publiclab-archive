Biology is the study of life.  

Biotic is relating or resulting from living things.

Biomes is a large natural community occupying a major habitat.  

There are five major types of biomes: aquatic, grassland, forest, desert, and tundra. 

Tundra is very cold which has an average of -7 Celsius. There are only two seasons which are long dark winters, and short summers. 

Another type of biome is hydrosphere, that's part of freshwater. The Hydrosphere consists of 2 different biomes, the Saltwater Biome, and the Freshwater Biome. 

Marine biomes cover up about 71% of Earths water. Out of all the water on earth only 3% is drinkable and 97% is undrinkable.  

21% of Earth’s atmosphere consist of water.
