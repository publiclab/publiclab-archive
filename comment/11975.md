Probably just pressure would be sufficient.  I am not certain but there is probably a constant relationship between pressure change rate and speed/distance.  That will probably require individual calibrations which may be accomplished via GPS fixes though.

I just remembered  the other sensor that was being used was a digital compass to get both heading and pitch.
