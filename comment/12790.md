Kiran,

The graph is a histogram which can be made in free programs like GIMP, IrfanView, or Fiji or photo editing programs like Photoshop. Here is an old note about histograms: <http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/06-13-2013/histograms>.

I used the Photo Monitoring plugin for Fiji to make the NDVI image. You can get this program here: <https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin> and there is a user manual included.
