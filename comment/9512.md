Great tone difference at around 2:26! I love the idea (discussed with [@dorncox](/profile/dorncox)) of listening to two of these at different ends of your yard, or up and downstream, and hearing the difference in tone, or the delay in tone change between the two to indicate directionality... there's a lot to explore here in terms of how people will use these and build intuitions and insights on their use. Great photo of [@kgradow1](/profile/kgradow1) listening to it!

Don, does Heather have a username we could callout?
