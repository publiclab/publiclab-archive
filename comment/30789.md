It's been 4 years since this post was made and a lot has changed, I would recommend using [https://changedetection.io](https://changedetection.io) , it's available as opensource, supports email, Discord, Telegram, and 70+ other notification systems. You can even interact with the browser, login, search etc etc before the change-detection runs, hope it helps and sorry for the bump!
