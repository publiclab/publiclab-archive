Sodium lamps have very distinctive spectral emissions, so it is fairly easy to distinguish them from other types of lamps. Once you become familiar with the different types, you can distinguish them with the naked eye based on color. Until then, a very simple spectrometer is all you need. I think any of the Public Lab spectrometers will work if they are built properly, but I have not tried them for this. It was very easy to get a good [spectrum of a high pressure sodium lamp](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/2-26-2013/broadening) with a similar spectrometer I made. I was standing right under the streetlamp looking up (at nighttime) and there was plenty of light, but my spectrometer had a better camera than the Public Lab spectrometers.

I could not find much information about which of the Public Lab spectrometers might be better at low light levels or for distant light sources. It might be that a smart phone camera is better than a webcam (Desktop spectrometer) or Raspberry Pi camera (Lego Spectrometer).  It is also more portable than the other spectrometers. So a piece of DVD, a narrow slit, and a tube in front of your phone camera is probably all you need. When you get everything aligned, take photos until you figure out how to get a good exposure of the spectral patterns. A good camera app might help. You might not even have to upload the photos to Spectral Workbench once you learn the difference among the spectral patterns in different lamps.
