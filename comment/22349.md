Hi there! I've been trying to use the spectralworkbench with IOS with no success using Browser app. That web browser is suupposed to use WebRTC but I don't think It's working either. When trying the spectralworkbench the browser remains saying "requesting camera access" to the infinite. When I checked on the IOS settings, the camera has never been requested access from the Browser app. Also this app shound work with https://meet.jit.si but It's not, so I think the app is lacking access to the IOS camera. Anyway using [@Liz](/profile/Liz) method works great ;)
