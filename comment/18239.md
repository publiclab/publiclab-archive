Ned's last comment reminded me of something I found with our equipment a few years ago. My lab had 4 NIR converted cameras.  Three had R & IR pass filters and one had IR pass filter only. In the case of the latter, the IR recorded by the red camera channel was was always substantially higher in raw DNs than the IR recorded by the blue channel. I expect this non-uniformity in channel sensitivity to NIR is due to the proximity of IR to red compared to blue. In addition to the NIR pollution that Ned mentioned, I suspect the heterogeneous response to NIR would further confound ratio indices like NDVI. Rabatel (2014) developed a method that might help reduce the influence of NIR pollution in the red band, but the math is pretty deep so I never got around to attempting it.
