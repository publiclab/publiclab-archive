I use Fiji with the photomonitoring plugin...I would like to create a legend with the values, what would be AWSOME is to have the values on the image as well, not sure if this is possible.

To be honest I'm new to all this and I'm not real sure what the difference in Fastie, stretched and normal processing do.

I currently have a drone with a NDVI-7, an NDVI lens created by IR pro, camera on it.
