Some samples of the dye dispersion patterns as seen from the balloon camera:

We discovered that depending on where you are on the Canal, currents and sediment deposition patterns either hug the shore, or will swirl out into center of Canal.

The water patterns of the Canal shoreline of the main branch Canal (eg: Salt Lot Area) seem to favor narrow "strip" wetlands, whereas areas with shoreline bends (the 30 degree bend at Carroll Street Bridge, the 90 degree side basin ends) seem to support sediment accumulation favoring larger "blob" wetlands.
