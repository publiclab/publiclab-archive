Hi Chris,

Thank you so much for taking the time to consider my problem! I'm afraid I am a relative NDVI neophyte and therefore I do not know how much of the light captured is visible vs. NIR, however, I revisited the Astro Pi hardware page and can confirm the Pi NoIR does not have an IR filter (so near-IR light is captured), and it also does have a small plastic blue filter specifically to observe chlorophyll production in plants: [](https://astro-pi.org/about/hardware/ir-camera-module/)

I have included a screenshot of the previous photo unedited with the color adjustment and EXIF info included; it seems there are 4 distinct peaks, one of which (light blue) is overlapping with the red peak; I assume this is the near-infrared light? If so, I assume the  "R-B" portion of the NDVI equation is meant to leave only the IR light, while the "R+B" is meant to account for all light absorbed? If such is the case, could we simply add value (e.g. +1/2) to this equation to "brighten" the image and enhance any IR light? 

I mention this because one of my students found the following wiki page regarding Infragram with Raspberry Pi ([](https://publiclab.org/wiki/raspberry-pi-infragram)), and he noted the equation displayed at the top of the page was not the same as the NDVI equation we had been using (R-B/R+B), however, I was unable to find justification for this discrepancy, and I remain unsure what the implications for arbitrarily adding value to the equation would be (again, I assume this is to "brighten" the image and adjust for the limitations of the camera?); any clarification you could provide would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you again for taking the time to consider our problem, and if there is any further information I can search for to help answer it, I will be more than happy to provide it. 

Regards,
Brendan Stanford
