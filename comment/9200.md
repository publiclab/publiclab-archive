Nice work. What sort of fan are you using to draw air across the sensor?

Also, if anyone visiting this page would like to do something like this themselves I made an Instructable with step by step instructions: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-measure-particulate-air-pollution-and-share/

My setup isn't quite as sophisticated, but it posts the data to Xively.com and isn't too complicated.
