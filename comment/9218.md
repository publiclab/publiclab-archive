This is very impressive. Thanks, Vidun.

I'll ask on the grassrootsmapping list -- but Pat - do you have an image set which has GPS exif data?

I believe any iPhone image will have built in exif GPS tags. Here should be an example: http://www.brianklug.org/2011/11/a-quick-analysis-of-exif-data-from-apples-iphone-4s-camera-samples/
