I have been considering this too, and am looking seriously at carbon covered sponge that we have at work. We sell it in 2 products. One is for soldering iron smoke extraction. The other is a carbon sponge matting for storing electrostatic sensitive components.Its basically activated carbon bonded to some sort of sponge material.
I think the one for storing components appears to be better and more robust in regards to it not falling apart and dropping charcoal dust falling off inside the spectro'.
