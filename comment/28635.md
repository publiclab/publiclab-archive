We can use less technology that contributes to pollution like cars which is a major polluter around the world. We can also change the type of cars we use to electric so we don't add on to the greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Also using less cars that don't rely on gasoline will reduce the chances of oil spills since the will be less demand for oil which is overall better for the entire planet.
