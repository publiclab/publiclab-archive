You might look into TPMS ( short for tire pressue monitoring system) by j. Boone.  Its freeware that runs on linux.  The hardware is a rtlsdr ( it will set you back about $25).  The software is not set to count, but will give the the tire pressure and tire id on each tire that passes.  It should be easy to modify to count.  The older cars should be a small portion of the total.  

A linux computer is pretty cheap, so the whole system should be relatively inexpensive.  Go to rtl-sdr.com.  At the search function, try Tpms.  Let me know of any problems.
