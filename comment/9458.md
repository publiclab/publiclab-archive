Oh hmm... The config file you posted shows

    Customized White Balance 1 Red Gain=[310],Green Gain=[500],Blue Gain=[700]; 
    Customized White Balance 2 Red Gain=[580],Green Gain=[500],Blue Gain=[350]; 
    Customized White Balance 3 Red Gain=[400],Green Gain=[320],Blue Gain=[260]; 
    Set red ,green,blue gain,256 is 1x gain,value from 100 to 999;

So which is a value of 8 using? Thanks!
