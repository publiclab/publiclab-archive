Thanks for the info Chris.  I also ran across the [KnowFlow](https://publiclab.org/notes/shanlter/06-08-2017/knowflow-automatic-water-meter) that has a lot of pretty good info. They also rely heavily on the DFRobot sensors. Until I get different info, I'm going to plan on using the KnowFlow as a foundation, likely with a reduced number of sensors until I get things going.  I was hoping to be able to collect continuously along the full stretch of the creek, but that might not be feasible right now (financially as well as technically).  

I've already been asked to apply for a grant, being sent to a class/conference on water sampling (Estes Park), and invited to present at some mining conference next year. Guess I need to get my midden organized into a smaller pile.  

For what its worth, it seems to be difficult to search for info across the website and wiki's .  I have a few other questions about specific sensors and I'll just start a separate thread. 

Yep, going to be a long year.  My wife is a Master Gardner, but the cap on the flood plain really isn't soil. 

Thanks for the suggestions!
