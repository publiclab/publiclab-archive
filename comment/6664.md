I've got your code working locally, and it's gorgeous.  Just to play around, I tried adding in some of your video instructions as explanation on the main page, and rearranged the controls a bit (less elegant than your version, just playing).  The results are here: http://pvos.org/infragram-js/infragram.html  (the actual javascript doesn't work yet, I think I goofed on some of the URL refs ...)

Bravo!!
