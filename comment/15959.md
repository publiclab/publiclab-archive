The reason I was doubted the result is that I have way more red LEDs than blue. Both colors seems (visibly to eyes) to have comparable brightness, so I don't know how can the camera picks up more blue than red. 

As for the white balance I couldn't figure out a way yo change it since none of the browsers (Chrome, Firefox) use allow me to change the white balance setting for the input webcam. I know of the softwares such as Amcap that I can play with settings such as white balance. I might be able to take a picture in there and then upload and compare the result with the one that browser got from the cam directly. 

There is no way I can change the white balance to see the difference in the color. The paper is just a plain A4 white paper so I doubt that is the cause unless it is better at filtering red than blue. 

Thank you Chris,
