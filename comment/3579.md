Hi Chris,
I'm trying to following your advice to avoid overexposure and wondering about the different exposure levels in my spectrum https://spectralworkbench.org/spectra/show/4004

The highest level is 86% @ 336nm. (so I assume it is not overexposed) But as soon as I switch to RGB mode there are 100% levels @ 387 and 336nm.
Q: how should I interpret this?

Thanks for your help!
Gerhard
