Hi Sara,  I tried a few more things last week that I will post soon.  One is already <a href="http://fastie.net/?p=1492">here</a>, and I will describe that in a research note in a while.  I also have some aerial images with the IR camera pair that I hope to process soon. Lots more psychedelic plants! Thanks, Chris
