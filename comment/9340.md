Also a brief search into OpenCV and 3D Aerial Photography yielded some promising results- This post on Stack Exchange almost seems like it came from someone at PublicLab- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22180512/algorithm-for-ortho-rectification-mosaic-ing-aerial-images.  Mathew, CFastie, and Warren-  Has anybody examined the use of OpenCV for 3D Ortho-Rectification?  Or is this a new discovery?  If so I'll post a new research note about it.
