I agree that this is great Zenon and we are looking to do something similar with another project. Who was your audience for this video? For our context, I'm thinking some explanation of thermal pollution might also be helpful - like what does higher temp water mean for the ecosystem in these environments and is there a way we can show that. 

Also, how did you get the calculation where you translated temp to pixel? We are trying to figure out ways to do that as well.
