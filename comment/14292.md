Excellent; so we'll think about timeframe plus # of samples. I think we could prompt people in the interface to "ensure stable reading" during a few seconds -- even as we get folks using more mechanically stable setups, this could be relevant if they've customized or added a lighting/sample-holding setup, or are trying for portable readings or something. 

In terms of interface, we could have a checkbox that says `[ ] 5-second exposure for noise reduction` or something like that, and show a popup for the 5 seconds that says `Do not move: recording`... what do you think?
