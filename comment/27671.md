While messing about with the data, I came up with some other ways to approach the situation. Based on the pixel count of the "vegetative tissue" I derived the leaf area in cm2 for each plant using the measuring tools in ImageJ. A similar boxplot-graph as before was produced, but still no statistically significant values were present until 6 hours before wilting.

Then, by creating an index which included the leaf area and the previous average NDVI for each plant, I produced yet another graph. This approach did actually yield some statistically significant differences already at 30 hours before the wilting point.

This is based purely on my experimentation with the data, and I'm not sure whether I can use it in my thesis. I haven't come across with any similar approaches in the literature.

In determining the significance values I used a T-test with two-tailed distribution and assuming equal variances.
