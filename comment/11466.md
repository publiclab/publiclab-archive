Hey [@claf](/profile/claf) I'm doing some air monitoring work in areas of intensive fracking here in PA (weather variables, formaldehyde, ultrafine particulate matter) let me know if we can be of help. We will be doing community monitoring of fracking infrastructure beginning in mid-may. 

I didn't see any data sheets on the "Smart Environment" website. I worry that the detection limit on those sensors would be too high (ie the exposures would be below the lowest reading).
