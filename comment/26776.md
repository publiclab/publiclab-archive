Ok, it's a question of the process and how much you know about it.  If you know everything that's likely to be produced in a plant ( say a refining operation), you wouldn't need to do gc/ms analysis. There are usually much cheaper instruments that will give good info.  That said, gc/ms might still be done ( say yearly) to make there was no major change. 

On the other hand, in a n emergency response, you may have no idea what substance is involved.  Gc/ ms maybe the best and fastest way to get the information.

As far as I know, gc/ms is still a lab operation.  Having said that, gc/ms, lc/ms, and flash gc prices have been trending downward in the last few years.  The size is also getting smaller.
A portable version could be on the market.  

Just be careful.  Mass Spec can be touchy.  Be sure to get a lot of info before committing to anything.
