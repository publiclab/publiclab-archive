hi jeff - thanks! we're hoping to try out the kite mapping in the andes, where we can build on the skills and knowledge local communities already have. am already looking forward to the collaborative learning. let me know if there is anything different i should do in terms of how i add research notes, etc. in the meantime.  xoxo
