Thanks for the instructions, after reading this i punchraised a mobius from ebay, hopefully not a fake ^^

English is not my mothers tongue, so i have a question:

After removing the IR filter inside, can i take "normal" pics too? or is it unuseable for daylight?

the last 3 pics from you, what is the original, which are processed with computer?

I want a mobius wich acts as a normal cam for daylight, as an infrared cam for IR-Pics in daylight and also want to put an external ir board plate (with about 35 IR LEDS on it, the things on the CCTV cams) on it when i want night vision...

is removing the internal filter all i have to do?


Thank you very much, 

and thanks again for the instructions you wrote!!

zorn!
