The difference in spectra is due to the light source, and won't help you obtain more or better data. If your light source is lacking intensity at a certain wavelength, you could provide additional sources to add additional wavelengths, but I don't see why you would use fiber optics to pipe the light; just combine the light sources (one behind another, or diffuse reflection off a common surface)
If a light source is causing over-exposing at a certain wavelength, you might use the optics to reduce the intensity of that light source.
