That is such a good idea, [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n)!! We should definitely try this. [@sara](/profile/sara), what would you think about trying this with copper strips that are colocated with Purafil coupons, and we could look at the dissolution rate and extent alongside Purafil's reported oxide/sulfide ratios.
