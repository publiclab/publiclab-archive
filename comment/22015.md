So, I think it will be great if we can have it like facebook too. We can also create notification page which can list all the notifications. What do you think about this page [@warren](/profile/warren) [@namangupta](/profile/namangupta)?  [@IshaGupta18](/profile/IshaGupta18) oh your and his idea is similar.
