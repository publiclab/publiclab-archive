I think it could be done but we may want to think about how separate we can maintain the two systems so that the initial notifications API can be developed first, and the "notifications you missed" later?

So, I think it will be great if we can have it like facebook too. We can also create notification page which can list all the notifications. What do you think about this page [@warren](/profile/warren) [@namangupta](/profile/namangupta)?  [@IshaGupta18](/profile/IshaGupta18) oh your and his idea is similar. It will be great to review your proposal too.
