Love the wiki idea!  Also love the .json idea.  Sounds as though, as long as we come up with a tagging / formatting convention, we could do the wiki thing, and generate .json if interested in export? 

E.g. we could just say:  for each "field", use a wiki header, like "#"?  and then we can nested structures, using subheadings?  So that exporting the wiki as json would be standardized?  And perhaps tags would end up going into a "keywords" field upon export?
