Hello [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) ! A link to the decoder will be added before the end of the week. This research note will be expanded to include information on the process of creating the decoder, how it works, and different aspects of NOAA signal processing. It won't have as many features as WXtoImg, but it should produce high quality raw images. More soon!
