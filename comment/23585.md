Hey everyone,
As discussed with [@jywarren](/profile/jywarren), we are going to participate in RGSoC this year. My suggestion is instead of registering as a single project. We can submit multiple projects, each related to a repository i.e. Plots2. Mapknitter, Image-sequencer etc.
What are your thoughts?
