Can you share a picture of the camera? Sometimes the camera *is* set in the threads with a little bit of locktite or something that looks like melted black plastic (plastic on the outside is visible, locktite you probably won't see)-- if you see the plastic it can be easily removed/peeled off (you may want to carefully use an exacto blade to get it started) which will make it easier to get things started-- if it's got thread locker it usually just takes a hard twist, but you can use pliers to get a firmer grip/more leverage (you can also just skip to this step to break the plastic seal if you have one-- it should pop off pretty easily with a good turn). 

If you're worried about damaging the camera while you work on loosening the lens, you can also unscrew the lens and lens mount from the board while you do this. 

Hope this helps!
