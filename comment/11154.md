MrBumper - saw your note in Liz and my post about modes of research. I was thinking, what about a mode in the software that says "you're in training mode; your spectra will be labeled as 'testing' until you're ready to start posting experimental data" or something? So user accounts would have a "mode" which would start out as 'testing' and move on to 'experimenting' -- although those terms are a bit ambiguous, so if you have a better idea please chip in.
