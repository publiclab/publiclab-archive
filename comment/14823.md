[@stoft](/profile/stoft) hello dave, I don't know why you think it is not possible, you have such a defeatist attitude. Of course its possible, I'm not going to do all the bloody work for you, check these sites out: 

http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=57253  LED arrays
http://www.mightexsystems.com/family_info.php?cPath=&categories_id=112  Universal light source

I also know about the LEDs that Warren wants to use and test, I have them, here is a pic of one I soldered and yes, it works, but it's luminance just isn't going to cut it.

This little thing was very difficult to work with, it really needs to be baked on a PCB with  a solder reflow technique. 

I guess I'm just more of an optimist when it comes to solving a problem that others seem to think is impossible.
