Update:
The diode array has gone from obsolete to unobtainable in a matter of a few months.
I am testing an ILI1402 (made by ic Haus) which is supposed to be a direct replacement but without the small gap between the two 128 element dies, but it operates at 5V so I am evaluating various step-up converters. I am going to replace the colour display with a B/W reflective LCD as it will be much faster and will take much less current.
I am also looking into using a flash memory chip to store the data then transfer out with a USB connection as the SD card has given nothing but problems.
I am also tinkering with the optics to increase resolution and am probably going to add a UV LED along with incandescent bulb to improve the sensitivity below 400 nm.
