[@abdul](/profile/abdul) You can take a look at the project here

https://github.com/mirkix/BBBMINI

Basically, Mirkix modified the linux port of the Ardupilot project to work on Beaglebone black with an extra cape. It is way cheaper than buying Navio or Erle Brain, which take ages to ship and are outdated fast. Check the github link and let me know if you have any questions, happy to answer :)
