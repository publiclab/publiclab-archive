Evaporation, Precipitation, Condensation, and Sublimation are all factors to the water cycle. 

In my group’s project we tried to find as many microplastics as we could to put into a bottle. We used receipts, lint, sanitizer, paper, tissue, cards, wrappers, etc. These are few of the millions of pollutants that are found in our waterways before purification. Even though our water is purified and the macroplastics are removed, it doesn’t mean that those tiny microplastics aren’t. These microplastics are ingested when we drink water.
