Tom Milnes from Hypr3D responded on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/publiclaboratory/ZTWbCmg31NI">discussion forum</a> with a workaround to the problem of the HighResTexture.jpg not displaying.  He recommended downsampling the jpeg because the high resolution version requires a lot of memory to map and display it. I downsampled by 50% and it worked.  Thanks Tom. Below is a snapshot from MeshLab of the high res model with the 50% res texture map.

If anyone with more than 8 GB RAM and 4 GB graphics memory wants to try the high res version, you can <a href="http://www.hypr3d.com/models/4fc6910e74dbfb0001000091">download it here</a> and open it in the <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">free MeshLab</a>. Nathan Craig made a <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/nmc15/blogs/anthspace/2011/12/hypr3d-and-meshlab-to-scaled-model.html">video about how to do this</a> (with an older version of MeshLab).
