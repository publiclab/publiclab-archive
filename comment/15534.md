This is such a big post, I'm wondering if we could continue (as our earlier upgrades start to see replications) to adapt multiple additional upgrades out of it -- like swappable slits, perhaps. And do you think we could then reference this from each of the narrower-scoped upgrades and remove the original from the [upgrades grid](https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry#Upgrades)?
