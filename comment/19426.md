Kina, thanks for the videos. Very helpful. I might try CoolTerm again, since I was using a sketch that did not format the serial output in an appropriate way.

Liz, my last comment was directed at the person (Nick?) who will end up in the same room with the HCHO sensor and an Arduino. That person will probably have a time crunch and will want to have all the hardware and software ready to go (Arduino/logger, power source, cable for sensor, sketches).  Other than gathering the hardware and software, there might not be too much else to do to prepare for that crunch, although getting comfortable with the Arduino could be important. 

An important next step might be deciding whether to use a laptop or a data logger to save the data from the sensor. If you don't have a laptop to dedicate to the effort, the decision could be easy. If leaving a laptop running for the data collection period is possible, then it will be good to replicate Kina's video exercise. If you can't make that work, try a similar exercise with a data logger. What arduino would you use if a laptop was dedicated to the project? What data logger would you use if no laptop was involved?
