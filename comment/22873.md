The posted graphs are, mostly, just individual experimental plots.
Assuming 1) working spectrometer, 2) has been wavelength-calibrated using a CFL light source, the first step is defining what you are attempting to detect/measure. Eg: The concentration of Betanin (red color of beets and similar veggies) in different veg sources? If you can define what factor is of interest, then you can figure out if there is a way to measure it.
