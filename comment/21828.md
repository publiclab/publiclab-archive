 Hi guys, can you give a bit of background and I'll try and help as I've just finished a first project in this area.

People: are you looking to represent a specific area or community you live in? Are you intending to measure at one site or several? Is it incorporated with education, research or community?

Science: what kind of measurements are you trying to make in terms of Particulate Matter, NO2 or another parameter?

Technology: are you looking at IoT sensors as a way to represent this?

A good site to start with is Thingful.net and see if there are any sensors taking measurements in your area.

Thanks!
