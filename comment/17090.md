There could be innocent or devious motivations for you to paste, without attribution, this exact [question from StackExchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/131030/what-is-the-standard-1-wire-bus-connector) which was asked and answered there almost three years ago. 

If you can convince someone here that your motivations are not devious, you might get an answer.

Thanks,
Chris
