Hi - This recent paper might be helpful: www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/6/2/38/pdf
From my experience satellite based surface temperature works best over fairly homogeneous features like water, crops and bare soil. A city environment is very heterogeneous. A lot depends on the level of spatial detail and temperature precision you are looking for. I'm happy to talk about this but I'm leaving for a one week trip early Friday.
