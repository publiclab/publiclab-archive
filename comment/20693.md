Hey [@Bronwen](/profile/Bronwen),

As Stéfanni explained to Liz, we are still working on the search. Many of the problems you mentioned will be solved - we hope so ;) - with some of the other improvements we are working on! Right now, with the actual version in production, our aim is just to test natural mode x boolean mode x likes x etc... When we finish the new version of the search we will write a post explaining everything we did and we will try to address all the concerns you shared with us here.

##Can you explain what "Natural Mode" is and how it works (especially in regards to results ranking)?

So, we are using the MySQL full-text search: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/fulltext-search.html.

_"A natural language search interprets the search string as a phrase in natural human language (a phrase in free text). There are no special operators, with the exception of double quote (") characters. The stopword list applies. In addition, words that are present in 50% or more of the rows are considered common and do not match.
[...]
A boolean search interprets the search string using the rules of a special query language. The string contains the words to search for. It can also contain operators that specify requirements such that a word must be present or absent in matching rows, or that it should be weighted higher or lower than usual. Common words such as “some” or “then” are stopwords and do not match if present in the search string. The IN BOOLEAN MODE modifier specifies a boolean search."_

About the  wildcard (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fulltext-boolean.html):

_"The asterisk serves as the truncation (or wildcard) operator. Unlike the other operators, it is appended to the word to be affected. Words match if they begin with the word preceding the * operator."_

I'm concatenating the '*' with the query directly in the code because I don't know if people, in general, know how to use it. My code:
