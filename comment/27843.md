Hi [@noi5e](/profile/noi5e) I loved this post -- the longer version even more! I'm also v into bicycling, and just need to fix my front tire before going out in the snow later today, i hope! Usually i'm on a single-speed cross bike but this weather is a bit rough even for it (just had a snowstorm). 

Impressive range of careers -- i'm looking to get into fishing and crabbing myself with a couple fish-related projects upcoming. But i'm a beginner -- my early years i spent a lot of time chasing crabs around in marshes but almost none fishing, and i really want to catch some mackerel. 

Super appreciate your wolf puzzle story, the beliefs and attitudes you're bringing (esp. beginners mind!!) and we are very grateful to have your time and care on this team. ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ’¥
