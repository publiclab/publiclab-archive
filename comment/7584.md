I think doing calculations based on red and green might be two ways to get to the same result that Chris was seeking in his Oaktober note-- the change in chlorophyll from living to dead.  NDVI, since its an absorbance vs. reflectance index might not be the best with a green channel, because we're comparing reflectance of green to reflectance of IR, but that said, it does seem like there's something there.
