I think you understand.  I didn't know that Live Capture downsamples, only that there are about 550 pixels between 400 and 700 nm in the Spectral Workbench data. I also should have known that 550/300 is substantially greater than one, but that is another issue. So that resolution is not too bad at all, about 1.8 pixels per nm.
