Hi [@iragersh](/profile/iragersh)- This sounds like a great project. Off the top of my head, I would think the people/organizations who would be the most helpful in helping you get started on the process of obtaining permits and permissions would be some of the folks engaged in waterfront use/access elsewhere in NYC-- The Gowanus Dredgers and North Brooklyn Boat Club/Newtown Creek Conservancy are a few that come to mind, and I imagine that there are different avenues for tackling this project depending if your water access is via City owned or leased property or as part of a partnership with a private land owner or lease holder. Since the West Harlem Piers are part of the City Parks Department I'm assuming they have their own internal procedures for approving and moving forward with on-site projects. 

Perhaps [@eymund](/profile/eymund) has some ideas about permits relating to waterfront access?
