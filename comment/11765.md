I'm excited too Mathew. The Saturn Rig Kit and SkyShield Kit could make a great package for under $150. Add a camera and you have a nice autoKAP setup for way less than I have seen elsewhere. I think I will put a couple beta units of the whole working setup at the KAPtery in a few days. Maybe kits too. It's already at Thingiverse: <http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:845522>
