This is a really good result. Why is NDVI artificially high in the shadows? In really dark parts of a photo, the values representing how bright each color channel is (the digital numbers or DNs), are very small. So the variation in those values due to things other than plant vigor can become  much greater than the variation due to plant vigor.  With small values, the value for NIR in a particular pixel is just as likely to be larger than the value for VIS as it is to be smaller.  So NDVI values for plants in dark parts of photos are never going to be reliable.  

However, you have noticed a pattern that is common in single camera and dual camera NDVI systems, that NDVI in dark parts of photos is usually artificially high, and rarely low. So there is a tendency for either (NIR-VIS) to get  unreasonably big, or for (NIR+VIS) to get unreasonably small.  I think you nailed it with your example: regardless of the value for NIR, as VIS approaches zero, NDVI approaches NIR/NIR which is 1.0 (the maximum value for NDVI). Since NDVI is indeed approaching 1.0 in dark areas, maybe we can assume that VIS approaches zero faster than NIR. I don’t know why this would be, but apparently at low light levels the filter is allowing more NIR into the NIR (blue) channel than it is allowing VIS into the VIS (red) channel.  But it could also be related to the color balance, contrast, or exposure algorithms hard wired into these consumer cameras. It may also be an artifact of the custom white balance we do to get realistic NDVI values for well-lit parts of a scene. As you say, there are no guarantees that the response curves in the blue channel  (NIR) and red channel (VIS) are linearly related. I tried staring at the [first image in this note]( http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/06-20-2013/ndvi-from-infrablue)  to glean some wisdom on this topic, but I hadn’t had enough coffee.  

It is good to see an otherwise biologically meaningful NDVI result from a camera with a CMOS sensor. I think this might be the very first example I have seen of a Super-Red (Wratten 25A) image from a CMOS camera.  It would be good to see more. It would also be good to learn how you processed your photo, and what color table you used to display the NDVI result. This conversation is not going to have much meaning for most people who have little idea what the colors in that NDVI image mean (I am making wild assumptions about what they mean). Did you use a color table that assigns white when NDVI=1 and black when NDVI=-1?

Your custom white balance looks very good. Because you are breaking new ground with a Super-Red CMOS camera, experiments with other white balance colors are called for. Maybe try something red in direct sunlight. Or a red LED. Any results you can report will be very helpful.
