In a perfect world, you wouldn't be looking through plexi at your marine plastic because plexi has characteristics of plastic (scratches, reflection, etc) that might obfuscate or layer on what you're trying to analyze. Sometimes the clue that you're looking at a plastic and not paper, a shell, or an exoskeleton is very minute, and I'd worry that for tricky cases the plexi (or even glass) between the viewer and the plastic would sway visual interpretation.
So in short, it would be best to flip it, but also to have the lens and the stage farther apart, as the diagram shows. 

This image shows our two store-bought scopes (compound on the left, which we rarely use, and the dissecting scope on the right, where you can see light coming from below the stage and above, as well as the relative distance between the lens and the stage).
