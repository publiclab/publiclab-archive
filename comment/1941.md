Nice work! Thanks for sharing this. The color tables you generated produce very clear distinctions in the images. I would suggest one caution: The distinctions will be all but lost on those with red-green color-blindness. The value ranges are good, and a color other than red for the negative range will avoid the problem with that rather sizable population. Just a thought.
