Hi [@yravianand111](/profile/yravianand111), thank you for your proposal! I wonder if your design could make the image we see edge-to-edge with no margin at all. Or really minimal margin. See how https://photopea.com/ creates a working space that is an edge-to-edge workspace, even vertically it's fixed height. Not just responsive but almost full screen, or like a desktop app.

Maybe it would be helpful to see an extra mockup with an image added, so we can see what it will look like and how much extra space there is on each side. Likewise while editing an image, we could skip the footer and just have a completely edge-to-edge interface that is not scrollable. What do you think?

The tour idea is cool - and looks good - does Bootstrap have a convenient style for that, or is there a library you could imagine using? 

You mention that some buttons open dropdowns or bars or modals -- what would that look like?

Thank you!!
