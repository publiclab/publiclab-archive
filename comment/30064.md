Hello [@abiha_fatima1908](/profile/abiha_fatima1908), thank you for your proposal. Really excellent use of WAVE and great notes on accessibility compliance, I think these are super suggestions, and your notes on screen readers and input methods (onClick handler) are super helpful. 

I am curious, i've been suggesting that people remove the footer in favor of a full-height interface that has no vertical scrolling, much like https://photopea.com/ -- do you think that's a good idea? What are the pros and cons? 

The tour is a great idea and the left-side toolbar with distinct steps looks really nice too. How might that reflow for a mobile screen? 

Thank you!!
