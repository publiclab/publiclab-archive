The new firmware has a hibernate function, so you don't need to do this. You just let the mobius turn itself on and off, and let your additional power trickle charge when needed. 
That's the idea at least. In application, I'm having issues.

The camera likes to turn on when power is applied via USB. the solar unit I bought is supplying unreliable power, probably because it is cheap crap, honestly.

There is a setting in the firmware that lets you have the camera power on automatically with USB power applied, and also to have it autorecord once power is applied. Both of these are features for people wanting a dash cam in their car (turn on the car, camera is recording, turn it off, it stops).

However, even with these settings set to not let it turn on/off with power, it still seems to do this in photo mode.

I'll play with this some more. I really want to get this done and on the roof because they are about the tear down the building next to us and it would be awesome to capture!
