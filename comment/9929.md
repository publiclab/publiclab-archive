Aha! Line 7 of p54 says: 

> The Raman scatter line can be used to check for instrument stability and to quantify the
degree of contamination from a water sample by using the normalised fluorescence
intensity to the Raman peak.

This relates to the conversation [@ygzstc](/profile/ygzstc) and [@bsugar](/profile/bsugar) are having about how to normalize spectra, in this thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plots-spectrometry/5hM3w7FQ72w

And my notes in this research note about normalizing spectra: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-30-2014/equalizing-area-of-spectral-graphs-for-comparison
