Thanks so much, Chris! So it does look like the relationship is linear between output and ppb. here is what a friend writes who has used this tool before: "0 mV equals 0 ppb (actually background of 5 -10 ppb).

100 mV equals full scale (which I think is 1000 ppb for the 1000b).  Check with Interscan to verify the range of the unit.

Response is linear from 0 - 1000 ppb.  However, response increases with ambient temperature.  If you can control temperature, you will get more reliable data." I do have a rh and temp datalogger so its really just a matter of the ADC board now.
