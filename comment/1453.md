Hey Fernando,

Great to hear you're interested in getting involved in this project! As Shannon suggests perhaps you can describe in a research note and/or a message to the mailing list the background on your interest in this? Do you have H2S problems near you?

That will help us all brainstorm how you might get up and going on this. Also we're planning a call in the near future for those working actively on this project to hear about H2S problems in New Mexico and Colorado with a community organizer out there. Perhaps that would be a good opportunity for you to meet others working on this?

Cheers,

Sara
