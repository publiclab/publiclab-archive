We've had community members use the Lego Spectrometer (www.publiclab.org/lego) to measure LED spectra in the past. Here is an example of someone comparing different lightbulbs, including an LED bulb (https://publiclab.org/notes/dhaffnersr/09-06-2016/cfl-and-led-bulb-study-section-iii). 

This question (https://publiclab.org/questions/baxamook/03-01-2018/can-i-use-the-lego-spectrometer-to-measure-enviromental-light-spectrum) has an answer from  [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) that might be useful as  well.
