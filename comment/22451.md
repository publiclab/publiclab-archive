The macro was developed by Frank Aldiuos, a member of public labs. It basically is doing same thing as processing from the directory where all the parameters are supplied prior. It working well for me now. By the way, which color composition do you prefer when displaying the NDVI values. I have been experimenting with these and found NDVI_VGYRM to be more accurately representing the variations across the field.
