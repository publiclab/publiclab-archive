Finally, I chose the Websockets way.  Briefly: 

A Server runs on the RaspberryPI, grabbing the frames in shared memory using V4L2 ( ioctl).  The Server accepts connections on a specific port (5001), does the WS shakehand and broadcasts the video frames (inside WS frames.)  [This is all C/C++, mainly written from scratch (WS), **< 32K!**]

The Client is an HTML5 WebBrowser (Chrome, Firefox *Nightly*, dunno for Safari). It does createObjectURL from the data received and assign the URL as the src of an &lt;img>.  NDVIzation is done the same as it is now.

So far, so good, at about 30fps.  I probably will git it publicly but I would like to give a few more tests before.  Warren: feel free to contact me offline if you want to play the guinea pig role.
