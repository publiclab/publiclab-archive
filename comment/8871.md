The OpenLux will be able to solve lots of problems, but I only have one problem -- I live in a rural neighborhood on a dusty road and local officials don't think they should be concerned. We could use a recording dust sensor, but it has to be cheap enough that we can put them in arrays at several impacted properties and also at control properties along paved roads (these will be where the Select Board members live). Let me know when the price gets below $15.
