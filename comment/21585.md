I did this! Use 25.103 as the multiplier to scale the .stl file to the proper size in Cura and also the diffraction gradings are available on Amazon for $12. The print took me about 36 hours for 30% fill. The parts all fit snug and are well designed to reduce noise and light interference. Thanks for the awesome design and what fiber optic excitation instrument do you recommend for the, "In this configuration, the signal enters the cuvette from the side of the instrument and signal is collected as before."?
