One confounding issue is where the card goes in library shipment.  I'm looking at foam-lined reusable boxes we can package everything easily and minimize breakage or loss. 

the [Seahorse 300 case](http://seahorsecases.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=SE-300&Category_Code=SE_CASES) is the cheapest US-made box I can find that I think is the right dimensions.  at 9.5 x 7.5 it is a little smaller than an 8.5x11 card.
