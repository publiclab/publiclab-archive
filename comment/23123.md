Hi !
So i have been working on map oriented library trying to solve the above problem . I have added some of the layers mentioned here . Do check it out here : https://publiclab.org/notes/sagarpreet/06-06-2018/leaflet-environmental-layer-library
Some layers like Odor Report Layer , we can report the data ourselves and it would be visible on the map .

And it would be great if you can give some feedbacks too . 
Thanks .
