Sorry, I've been coding. Some more thoughts:

In the graph I posted of the basic, upgraded, and hi-res spectra, I realize it's hard to say what's more consistent without some absolute reading to compare to -- what we can do, however is see how much movement or crushing/moving of the Spec v3's case is needed to cause wavelength shift. Note the shif in [this spectrum](https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/embed2/55461), for which I don't know what instrument was used, but which demonstrates wavelength drift:

If we can demonstrate that a) the amount of rigidity doesn't prevent such shifts with reasonable handling of the device, and b) the shifts are large enough to substantively affect the outcome of tests we wish to do, then we should definitely work on rigidity. I haven't had trouble with wavelength shift, but perhaps I'm not pushing the limits of my spectrometer's durability as much as the average user. 

For kit costs, the [wood blocks](/notes/stoft/03-02-2015/plab-3-spectrometer-upgrade-prototype) you proposed are indeed cheap as materials (and well thought through!), but I'd like to push for even fewer unique parts and easier manufacturing. Any opportunity to use the same part multiple times, or to reduce the need for more steps to manufacture it (hole drilling, angle cutting, etc) is very helpful to keep the number of manufacturing steps down. I'm also not convinced we can't create a more stable paper design for the grating and slit -- assuming that we demonstrate that more rigidity is needed. 

To be clear -- at the moment, we are discarding amplitude information in our procedure in the Oil Testing Kit ([read more here](/notes/warren/07-30-2014/equalizing-area-of-spectral-graphs-for-comparison)), but I definitely agree that we should make it easy for users to enter -- as tag metadata, perhaps -- what attenuation level they were using. This would be important for any quantitative work especially. There are many reasons to more precisely -- and absolutely -- control amplitude, but at the moment we haven't staked that out as a necessity.
