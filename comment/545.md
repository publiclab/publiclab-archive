I have just built a test unit of this, seems to be working well.

For the moment I have the colouring scaled from pink, through blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, red and finally purple.  Currently have all of that set using intervals of the temperature (10-30oC), but might see if I can get that into an equation format (may be a sinusoidal one?) to make it a bit more flexible and configurable.  Saw something that someone has already written somewhere to do this, so going to check that out.

I plan to add two switches on it, one that will change the lowest temperature and a second that changes the total temperature range.  That should make it a bit more flexible for use.

Got rid of all that silly oF from the program too ;-), now just in oC, makes much more sense :-)
