We have two distinct ideas of "draft" which I want to try to reconcile -- one is to simply publish a post normally, but it'd be marked "draft" (kind of like a preprint preview on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org) or something):

* it'd show up in the normal feed (we could offer option to filter)
* it might specifically list input requested

Another is one which is not published, or not visible to anyone except those allowed by original author.

* it might be more complex since we might have to include notifications, tighter access restrictions

In either case, we could make the final publication date distinct from the draft publication date. I like the model of A better, but curious it'd meet the needs of the B scenario too, or if they're really quite distinct?

In any case, we can add multiple author access using the `with:coauthor` tag. 

Re: edit history, the faster way to complete it would be to store drafts in the browser `localStorage`, but this would mean you could not begin editing on a phone, then pick up on a laptop (a use case I'd really like, for adding images from my phone, but authoring on my laptop). So I have to consider whether a server-side edit history is possible (and worthwhile) in our timeframe. Another solution to this would be to have a "recent images" selector so it doesn't matter if you're editing the same draft, you can upload from your phone no matter what, and see images uploaded from any source when placing them.
