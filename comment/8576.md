Thanks cfastie.  I don't think I understand the need for the Wratten filter. My understanding is:

A camera with just the IR filter removed (i.e. no filter added thereafter) will give (N+R,N+G,N+B).
If the images from the two cameras can be aligned pixel-perfect, then subtraction will yield (N,N,N) for each pixel. Then you have got (N,R,G,B) as desired.

To be more general, I don't know that each sensor type is equally sensitive to NIR, so strictly, the camera with no IR filter will yield: (R+N1,G+N2,B+N3)

The subtraction will then yield (N1,N2,N3). If N1 = N2 = N3, we are back to the previous case. If not, its even more interesting, because that will give 5 or 6 channels (frequency bands) of data per pixel!

So why add a filter in the two camera setup?  What am I missing here?
