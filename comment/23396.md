 Hi [@vanshika421](/profile/vanshika421) - i saw you had a proposal posted before, but it doesn't appear now. Was that intentional on your part? Are you having any difficulties with it? Please feel free to ask and if you'd prefer to email me I'm at jeff@publiclab.org, and I am a mentor and project coordinator for our Outreachy program at Public Lab. Thank you!

Hi all - I'm going through these today to review (for real this time, sorry I kept getting held up!).
