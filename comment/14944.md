I think that if you post on instructables, we should be sure there are clear ways to contribute, since you might get some good attention from folks, and we'd want there to be some clear entry points into the project. 

I think this means:

1. merging latest code into publiclab/webjack (i can do this now if you prepare a single PR)
2. providing a good README about what the project does and how to use it
3. outlining next steps in issues, linked to from the README
4. perhaps linking to contribution guidelines as we do in the plots2 codebase

That way, if you do get interest, people don't just fork and disappear; they have a set of expectations and the code is welcoming. Make sense?
