I had a great experience, notwithstanding real difficulty though, following [@mathew](/profile/mathew)'s directions in person during the Annual Barnraising 2016 https://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/04-17-2016/making-an-openflexure-microscope. I would be very excited if anyone made installing the feet easier. I would love to have a working microscope.
