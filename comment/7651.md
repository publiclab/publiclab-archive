I guess you're right that taking a spectrum of the sun is not going to allow people in Santa Fe and Beijing to compare their peak heights.

Simple experimental setups that could allow elemental identification:

- gas discharge tubes
- flame spectroscopy (compare flame with flame+substance)
- fluorescence (compare UV laser in medium with UV laser in medium+substance)
- absorption spectroscopy (compare light transmission through liquid with liquid+substance)
- gas absorption spectroscopy (compare light transmission through gas with gas+another gas)
- others?
