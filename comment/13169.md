Yes Warren, and the cheap ones (OD 4) have a FWHM of aobut 3 nm, centered at the laser line. Fluorescence is always unwanted and Raman signals are proportional to inverse of lambda at fourth power. Thus a violet (405 nm) laser will produce considerably kor intense Raman lines but unfortunately a terrible lot amount of fluorescence, on the other hand, a near IR laser (1064 nm) will (almost) no pruce fluorescence but relatively low intensity Raman signals. What happnes is that a normal camera is prepared for green light. In general, Raman signals are very narrow sharp pekas and fluorescence signals are, in general, quite wide bands. There are several ways of overcome fluorescence, for example take the first derivative of the spectrum (at a cost of increasing the relative importance of noise) or time gated signal acquisition (Raman signals are almost instantaneouos while fluorescence signals are emited a few nano seconds after), I believe that this method is expensive. Another trick is what people calls SERDS, I will try to explain it in another mail.
