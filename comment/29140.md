[@Sara](/profile/Sara),  I believe your question specifically refers to indoor air quality, specifically particulates,  and humidity and because [@Warren](/profile/Warren) 's comments referenced a long ago comment  of mine I will comment here.  Unless your "indoors" is very unusual, eg a kitchen, laundry, or bathroom, a large number of animal bodies in a small room, or in a very humid outdoor location, the humidity will not vary as much as outdoor humidity. It will seldom rain inside your house or have moisture running down the walls. On the other hand for some people it may be so dry (for them) that they use a humidifier. So, in general, indoor humidity will not vary a whole lot. Will the humidity, whatever it is, effect the quantity of particulate matter? I would ask, where is the particulate matter supposed to be coming from? and how would humidity add or subtract from this?  There could be high humidity and low particulate concentration (a bathroom after a shower) or low humidity and high particulate concentration (a very warm northern home in winter with burning food on the stove). I believe [@Warren](/profile/Warren) 's comments refer to measuring particulate concentration and how humidity might effect a monitoring instrument. That's an important but different question. In short, I would say humidity at whatever level neither creates nor destroys particulate matter. And as to monitoring particulate matter, most indoor situations will not have humidity varying enough to make a difference of meaningful size in the measured concentrations.
