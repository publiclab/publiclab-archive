 That cell is likely just too big for what you are trying to do and therefore hard to flush.  I like using z-cells and tiny volumes since it is easier to flush and get air bubbles out.  https://oceanoptics.com/product/fia-series-flow-cells/  I've made my own and bought them in this design.

For the reaction coil - I just take tubing and wrap it around a small cylinder and secure it with cable ties.  There is absolutely no need to by them.  

You also will likely need to clean the cell and tubing regularly.  Running 1 M HCl through the cell, followed by deionized water seems to work for us, but only put the buffer through the cadmium column since you don't want to mess up the coating.  

Make sure you check your materials for how they will hold up to the reagents.  I've used peek, teflon (needs cleaning), and silicon without much problem.
