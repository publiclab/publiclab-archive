 [@warren](/profile/warren) Thank you for your resourceful feedback and references. This solution will be  in three steps.


1.Replace existing `getUserMedia` library inclusions with `Temasys/AdapterJS` in the infragram/(vr/pi)index(2).html and infragram/package.json files. Every instance of the code below


------------
    if (webRtcOptions.context === "webrtc") {...}
------------


  will be replaced by



------------
    if (webRtcDetectedType === 'plugin') {...}
------------
in the files infragram\src\io\camera.js and infragram\dist\infragram.js.



As `Temasys` is a WebRTC plugin with IE and Safari support we will no longer need code below on our infragram\dist\infragram.js file.



------------
    if (webRtcOptions.context === "flash") {...}
------------

2.Accepting Multiple video resolutions.
 We will adopt the same implementation of camera resolution selection and update from Spectralworkbench  where  default height and with constraints are set for initial use and updated whenever desired by attaching an onchange event to our HTML select option. 
 

3.Preserving image size upon Camera resolution update.
 From what I understood  the canvas size is constant while Webcam video(hidden) changes. 
 An approach would be to downsample each video frame(image) to fit canvas size while disabling interpolation. To downsample an image, we need to turn each square of p * p pixels in the original image into a single pixel in the destination image. As discussed here https://stackoverflow.com/a/19223362

The second approach would be to scale down the our webgl texture  as discussed here https://stackoverflow.com/a/19262385 
With a resolution video of 1280 width by 960 height
, a 640 width by 480 canvas size. we would have to scale down   our canvas context by half.

[@warren](/profile/warren) , I plead that to give me 48 hours to come up with a working implementation using the second approach. It 's taking a while for  to comprehend WebGL. Please I will post the implemented code snippet on the Friday 22nd  April 2022. Please , I just need some time with WebGL. Thank you.
