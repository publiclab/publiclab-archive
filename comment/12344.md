Thanks Ned, this is a very nice capability to have added. As I demonstrated with this note: http://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/03-23-2015/using-the-mapknitter-2-image-placement-using-geotagged-images
In my limited experience, Mapknitter places gps tagged images very nicely. In my test case, I basically just needed to rotate and scale. Granted it is within gps accuracy, so might need to translate a bit, but not much.
