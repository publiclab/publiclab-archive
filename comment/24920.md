Oh sorry! I misunderstood! Here, i've added that too now, but note that I believe I just found a standard m12 on thingiverse and resized it. So the scale may not be perfect... https://github.com/publiclab/community-microscope/blob/master/m12_lens_housing_v2.stl

There was a bit of trial and error on that one!
