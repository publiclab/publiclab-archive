OK - the GoPro clones can be corrected with: 

`a: 1, b: 1, Fx: 0.16, Fy: 0.16, scale: 1.087, x: 1, y: 1`

The Mobius (with default lens, i can check which it is) was harder but I got closest with:

`a: 1.048, b: 1.059, Fx: 0.09, Fy: 0.22, scale: 1.087, x: 1, y: 1`

Using the first black image above, i got:

[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) [@patcoyle](/profile/patcoyle) [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) you might want to give this a try now -- we can collect some different lens presets and even (in theory) recognize the type of camera by the EXIF data and auto-apply the right lens parameters:

Once you have the parameters adjusted you can just keep dropping images on there and it'll batch them at the bottom.
