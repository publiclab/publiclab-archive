We have some photos from May that I'm hoping to compare to. The difference from the ground is just astounding.

That was exactly the problem, thank you! I'll be sure to double check that option next flight.  

I selected two sets of rotations but removed the horizon-facing photos. Even if there were some near-duplicates, it would do nothing or maybe improve the process. Given the paucity of this dataset, I didn't bother checking. I think for structure from motion, 60-75% overlap is ideal. I'm not sure how to translate that to angles on the SkyShield, because it would at least somewhat depend on the altitude. 

We have the Skyhook 3.0, which requires 3 m3 helium.
