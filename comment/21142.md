Hmm, i see. I think they'll be close enough that we can make it work... I did a test here:&nbsp;[https://publiclab.org/wiki/sandbox-3](https://publiclab.org/wiki/sandbox-3)

  

We will be upgrading to v4 in the next six months. But how feasible do you think it is?&nbsp;[https://duckduckgo.com/?q=differences+bootstrap+3+4&atb=v141-5&ia=web](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=differences+bootstrap+3+4&atb=v141-5&ia=web)

> Hi again [@warren](/profile/warren),   I've just realized that Froala uses bootstrap 4.0 and not bootstrap 3. I assume I should be using bootstrap 3 as we discussed in the beginning - if so, which version exactly - or are you planning to move public lab to version 4 in the future?   Kind regards,  Eva
