Good observations! Remember that the AGC is likley based on the sum total over the entire image; not per pixel. If there were independent AGC per color or per pixel, the image would be very mess-up most of the time.

The Green channel likely has inherent lower noise because the Bayer filter in the camera is RGGB so double the number of sensors for G so the camera likely averages out some of the noise in that channel.

The Red is in the longer wavelengths where thermal noise may increase as an additive component (relative to all other channel noise sources. There might? also be more thermal noise at that end from the lamp despite being LED based -- but this is really just an additional question.
