[@tech4gt](/profile/tech4gt) I think [@stevie](/profile/stevie) or one of the Microscopy group participants will be able to better explain what they are looking for. I believe a list of particles their size (in pixel) and possibly a measure of round VS jagged would be great. But they should be the address.
