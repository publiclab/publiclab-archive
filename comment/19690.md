A long time later -- here's an attempt to use Image Sequencer to do this:

https://publiclab.github.io/image-sequencer/examples/#steps=import-image,blend,ndvi,colormap

This isn't quite working yet, but here are the separated images:

Visible:

Infrared:

[![san-martin-infrared.jpg](/i/25042)](/i/25042)

And the original NDVI from the above image:
