TedF,
Good design.
Just drag and drop photos to where the cursor is in the edit window. 
Blocks (pulleys) will help a lot to keep it level, especially since the center of mass will not be far below the level of the eyes. To make it level quicker without blocks, lower the camera an inch or two by putting a piece of styrofoam or something between the camera and the plywood. Let us know how it works.
