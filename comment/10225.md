interesting [@justinmanley](/profile/justinmanley) . I often make maps of the same site over time, and I like the titles to be crystal clear. Sometimes i search by date and placename. Sometimes i am looking for all maps that are in a larger geography, like, for instance all maps in New Jersey, and so it helps if that is captured in a searchable field as well. Date is critical, and the date the images are taken is rarely the same as the date the map was made. People commonly cause themselves future problems with inaccurate/lazy naming. In terms of visible vs infrared imagery, perhaps we add a checkbox for this?

I am interested in what you are saying about having basic information that stored in the database be more visible.
