[@warren](/profile/warren) I just got and tried using that light you suggested:
https://www.amazon.com/I-MU-Flexible-Gooseneck-Brightness-Gray-White/dp/B071Y3P8ZC/

It seems to work well!  I didn't have the "on the go" USB mini to female adapter to connect it to the raspberry pi, so I had to use the computer, but it seems to light pretty well.

My camera sensor has gotten really scratched from too many take-aparts and too much careless travel, but the rest of the image looks great.

I also got one of these gooseneck cell phone holders

Primarily for taking photographs for documentation, but it also works pretty well as a holder for using my phone's flashlight as an illumination source.
