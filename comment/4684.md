When I went to school in 1969 (something) the physics classroom was equipped with a big slide lantern that was installed by Siemens in 1925. It got its light from a carbon arc and it had a range of large educational slides. You could stack some slides and there was a rotating slide holder. I saw my teacher demonstrate polarising effects with it once, very mesmerising. You could set aside the carbon arc unit and project the Sun through an opening in the wall at the back of the projector with a hand operated mirror. It was all very well thought out. Later on, new regulations made it "unsafe" and it had to go........
