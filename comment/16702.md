That would be terrific if a ferrite bead eliminated the noise I was seeing. My impression was that the bead was protection against radio frequency interference that was picked up by the cable (acting as an antenna). My other impression was that the noise I recorded with the Riffle was not picked up by the cable but was generated by the boost converter electronics and was micro variations in the current sent down the cable. Maybe the ferrite bead would filter that out too. But I don't really know anything about this topic so I should stop relating my impressions.
