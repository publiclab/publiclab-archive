Hi again [@warren](/profile/warren), 

I've just realized that Froala uses bootstrap 4.0 and not bootstrap 3. I assume I should be using bootstrap 3 as we discussed in the beginning - if so, which version exactly - or are you planning to move public lab to version 4 in the future? 

Kind regards, 
Eva
