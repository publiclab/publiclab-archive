First, mark the position of the three screws. When you remove them, count the number of rotations needed to unscrew them. So you will need marks on the screws and marks on the plate. Then you can return them to approximately the same tightness when you reassemble it. Don't mix up the three screws.

To remove the hard glue I usually break off pieces with a craft knife. Keep chipping away until it is all gone. Clean up the pieces before you lift the sensor plate.
