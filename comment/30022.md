Thank you [@mathildaudufo](/profile/mathildaudufo)  for this detailed review. I would answer each accordingly:-
So yes, I thought having some set of frequently asked question segments would better improve the user experience on the website, I intend to have it on the same page as the home, so it replaces the present Q & A segment.
If a user does not feel satisfied, then the help menu would be better as it would contain more Q & A.

I absolutely agree with converting the Q & A section to a help menu instead as most of the questions are very helpful in using the website.I suggest it should be on a new page so as not to make the home page too busy and distracting which could be a little overwhelming for a first-timer.

I will update my proposal on my approach to implementing the cross-browser drag and drop functionality soon, including code snippets and GIF's where neccessary.

Thank you once again for the review [@mathildaudufo](/profile/mathildaudufo)
