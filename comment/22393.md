Hi Dave, 
This is a very interesting project. How is the Facebook group working for you so far?  

Based on the name of your Facebook group, I added the tag "liontamer" to your question here. As a result, this URL will show all content tagged with "liontamer": https://publiclab.org/tag/liontamer , click the questions tag to see your post. Perhaps you'd like to create a main page for your project, how about https://publiclab.org/wiki/liontamer ? 

Let me know if you have questions about using Public Lab as a research hub. Sincerely, Liz.
