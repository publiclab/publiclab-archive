Research notes are posted by one or two authors for a specific topic which is relevant only for a specific time frame like my call for outreachy proposal is useful only till March 26 and created for outreachy participants.

Wikis, on the other hand, are produced collaboratively by multiple users like a wiki on a country or a city, or gsoc-ideas wiki, etc. Here, community efforts are required to keep the information up-to-date and that's why anyone can edit the wiki(constraint: users which have posted atleast one valid note, etc -- for spam management). Research notes can be edited by author, co-author and admin only.
