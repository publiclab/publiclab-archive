Hi [@rafaelsol](/profile/rafaelsol), welcome to Public Lab! If you're interested in things that you can build with young people, you might be interested in some of the projects you can see listed at the link below-- some of our projects have a lot in common with toy-building (kites, legos, cardboard cutouts, etc). We're always excited to see projects that can get young people excited about making things and using different kinds of materials for exploration!
