Definitely these can be dangerous for the eyes. The LEDs seem nice because they are a little less 1800s feeling than those tiny tiny mercury bulbs!! Energy usage and probably consistency of brightness as well, i'd guess? Though I don't know mercury lines in that range, do you think there are advantages to spectral narrowness too? LEDs are usually not as narrow range, but I know very little about deep UV LEDs.

I'm very curious about lead detection with deep UV. A long time ago I used a toothbrush sterilizer to try to see lead residue on a bullet casing and it didn't glow at all. But I do see the references (https://libanswers.cmog.org/faq/143932) to "icy blue" fluorescence in glass due to lead. I'll post a question about that too... 

OK here i posted it separately: https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/03-02-2022/using-uvc-or-deep-uv-light-to-detect-lead-by-fluorescence
