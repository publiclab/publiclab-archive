Thanks a lot for the detailed feedback [@warren](/profile/warren)!! ðŸ˜ƒ 

1. I hadn't really observed the NodeTag model in detail. Yes, we can make use of that to delete tags added by banned users.
2. Regarding preventing first time users from tagging their work, yes I meant the system is not there in place currently and I would love to work on it!
