Bummer, I'm scheduled for an artist's opening on Friday night at my nature center (same weekend as the barnraising).  However, I could swear I saw something about your group being at the World Festival of Science in NY.  If so, I will be there June 1st for my NASA Space Apps team - Senti8.  Let me know if you will have Riffles there!
