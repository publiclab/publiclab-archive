The grating (DVD) bends the light as it separates it into colors. So the grating has to be at an angle to the light coming from the entrance slit. Note the [~45° angle of the web cam and DVD piece in the photo in step 5.](http://publiclab.org/wiki/video-spectrometer-construction#4.+Snap+off+the+useless+half+of+the+webcam)  So just rotate your webcam and it might work. The concentric grooves on the DVD should be perpendicular to the incoming light.
