What if we bought 99% rubbing alcohol? Would that be enough? 

It's so much less toxic to handle, that I'd be more comfortable buying this for our prototyping kits. It's also $9 for 16oz, and we could easily re-bottle it into smaller containers:

This would make a difference to both the kit cost and its safety. What do you think?
