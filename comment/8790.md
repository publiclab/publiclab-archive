What is the max amplitude of the voltages you are applying across the screws?  If this gets too high you could be electrolyzing the water, other ions/crap in the water, or worse corroding the metals in your electrodes which may lead to long term drift.  I think limiting voltages to below 0.1V should be sufficient to minimize these effects.  

To understand the effect of "polarization" you want to be thinking of a circuit model for the electrode-solution system.  At suficiently low voltages, no electrolyzing "Faradaic" DC current should be produced in the system.  As you apply a voltage jump between the electrodes, the charges in the solution rush to the electrode of opposite sign and start piling up there over time and "polarizing" the electrodes leading to a transient decaying current; you can think of this as charging up a very large capacitance (call this C_ep could be around 1-100 uF) that is proportional to the surface area of the electrodes and inversely proportional to the very tiny charge separation on the order of ~3nm between ions in the solution and an excess (or deficit) of electrons on the electrode surface.  

Your measurement is a little more complicated with a capacitance C_m (that you choose) which would be in series with C_ep, the solution resistance R_s, and the measurement resistance R_m (which you can also choose).  Capacitances in series combine as C_tot = 1/(1/C1 + 1/C2), so if C_m << C_ep then you can neglect the effects of polarization since the combination will be dominated by the smaller capacitance.  At moderate to high ion concenrations C_ep behaves like a large relatively fixed value since the charge layer is compact.  BUT, at very low ion concentrations C_ep can get much smaller and highly temperature dependent as the ions tend to form a diffuse layer. (See [double layer model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_layer_%28interfacial%29) for more info.)This latter condition is very hard to calibrate out and is best written off as a limitation of the measurement technique.
