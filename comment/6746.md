Thank you very much , at first I have to said that this project wouldn’t be possible without your collaboration (Public Lab)

And yes , at first you triturate and mix spinach with ethanol so the carotenoids and the chlorophylls leave the cells to get the ethanol solution(polar solvent) then you add a noonpolar solvent which means that the molecule is electrically uniform , so the chlorophyll leave the polar solution to get the noonpolar one, and now you have isolate the carotenoids in the polar phase and the chlorophylls in the non-polar one(Remember that non-polar and polar solvents never mix , they keep separate form each other) 

The non-polar solvent that I used is petroleum ether a highly oily substance that smells a lot and is hard to clean from glassware...but you can also use toluene,xilene,ethyl acetate, chloroform and some others
If you are interesting in the technique of isolation or you want me to extract the chlorophylls in other solvent please just send me a message

Petroleum ether is basically refined petroleum and it contents a lot of hydrocarbons
