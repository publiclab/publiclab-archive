[@MadTinker](/profile/MadTinker) Great project and approach here. I just finished my first prototype of the same thing, only the sensor is tethered to a weather proof box via 10ft cable. Did you ever deploy this in CO? How did the data look? Wondering if this approach can lead to reliable measurements long term. My preliminary data suggests the data isn't all that reliable for long periods, mostly due to light leakage, scum buildup, and debris interference. Let me know how your deployment went and any data you care to share!
