Chris, I just looked around at some of the posted spectra and I think I see the source of the issue you raised. The posted spectra images are NOT from full frame images, they are of a single line of pixels which are displayed as a time-series; top-to-bottom. True, that time series will NOT work as it is NOT a real spectrum. To get the full data I reference, you need to capture the full frame (or a sequence of frames and average them) and extract the spectral 'band' out of that frame. Any single-line pixel 'spectrum', even if in a time-series, is throwing away too much information. -Dave
