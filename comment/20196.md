You might do a search for notes by [@stoft](/profile/stoft) 're the plab v3 model. There are drawings that he produced and excellent discussions. The plab v3 mounts the slit horizontally and the grating is mounted directly onto camera lens housings. Your camera appears to have 6 ir leds for night illumination which should be disabled. I have built about 9 of these with various mods.
