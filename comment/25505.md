I found that I needed the heavy cyan filtration (at the expense of all the exposure variables you mention) to achieve an image approximating the magenta-red hues that were characteristic of the old Kodak Ektachrome IR film (this was my goal).  It may be that [@nickyshen0306](/profile/nickyshen0306) may find the 90cc cyan adequate for his/her work. Testing will tell!
BTW, I found that the best sensor to approximate the old Ektachrome hues was the Foveon sensor and not the Bayer sensor found in most camera systems.
