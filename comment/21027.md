hello here, 
as [@edie_blues](/profile/edie_blues) suggested, I did host my work on github pages here[Public Lab Tag page](https://mutisokelv.github.io/publiclab-tagpage/) [#ThanksEdie](/tag/ThanksEdie)

To the team now, I have changed quite some stuff around:
1. Changed the landing design
2. altered the side bar
3. added some research notes and paged them

the next version should contain:
 1. more research notes modified and reorganized
 2. questions
 3. wiki pages
 4. any updates and feedback I'll have got from you

[@warren](/profile/warren) [@liz](/profile/liz) [@edie_blues](/profile/edie_blues) i will need your feedback on the design so far, what you think needs to be changed or retained.
Thank you!
