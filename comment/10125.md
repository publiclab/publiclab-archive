I posted a [note about the new lut.](http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/08-26-2014/new-ndvi-colormap) There is a tab delimited file of the colormap in a comment there. I will put the lut file for use in Fiji there when I figure out how.  

It's easy to make your own lut in Fiji. With any lut active (e.g., make a new NDVI image), select Image/Color/Edit lut. Click on any of the 256 blocks to change it's color, or select any range of blocks. Then you will be prompted to select a color for the first and last block of your selection. It will fill in the gradient between those two colors. When you have the look up table you want, save it.

For discussing our NDVI work in the Public Lab community, it would be good if everyone was using the same lut, or maybe a small selection of luts. In any case, always include  a key to the colors when sharing any color mapped image.
