One thought on the microcontroller - we are using a Teensy 3.0, which has a 16 bit ADC built in (13 bit usable), and we've found it to be pretty darn effective.  Also, the newest version (Teensy 3.1) actually has 2 ADCs, so you can sample 2 channels simultaneously or, double the number of samples from a single source (increasing your resolution).  It also has a 12 bit analog output pin which may be useful for testing.  Kind of a nice integrated solution.

Awesome project!
