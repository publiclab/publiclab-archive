The coastal marsh restoration plan causes environmental succession this is an attempt at allogenic succession which is a new term that we have recently learned which is the succession of an ecosystem by the succession of the environment (abiotic factors). This plan made by man is driven on good intent but has its pros and cons restoring the barrier will help reduce the severity of storms such as Hurricane Ida which was the most recent large hurricane this being a pro because if a storm like Hurricane Ida was lowered in severity even by one category then many homes both for people and animals could have been saved and their lives as well. A con of this is the impact it will have on the wildlife because while going through with this plan fresh water and salt water will mix killing life which also damages the fishing industry because of the great decrease in population of many species of fish and crustaceans.
