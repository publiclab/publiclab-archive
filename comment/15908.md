Video editing programs usually have some way of converting photos into the frames of a video. 

In Adobe Premiere Elements if you click Add_Media/Files_and_Folders, the next dialog has an obscure check box called "Numbered Stills." If you check that and click on just the first photo in a directory, Premiere will make a video using all the photos as individual frames. This only works if the filenames of the photos have numbers in them and the numbers are consecutive (none can be missing). You can also have each photo repeated as two or more frames in the video, but that might work only in Premiere Pro, not Premiere Elements, and that variable must be set in the program preferences (Edit/Preferences). 

Yes, Adobe programs really are that terrible.
