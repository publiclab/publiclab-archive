Hi [@paulpapai522](/profile/paulpapai522) ! For the Community Microscope Intro kit specifically, the materials are listed [here on the store page for the kit](https://store.publiclab.org/products/microscope?variant=8179759612011). That page also links out to the other microscope designs that inspired the Intro Community Microscope. 

Are you interested in making the microscope stage, too? If so, here's a post about stage designs: https://publiclab.org/questions/melissajurist/10-15-2018/are-there-templates-available-to-laser-cut-the-stages-of-the-microscope-the-coroplast

...and design files here: https://github.com/publiclab/community-microscope/

Please let us know how it goes!
