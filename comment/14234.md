Great, Dave - can you send your address to jeff@publiclab.org so I can mail the LEDs to you?

I was thinking we'd want to be really rigorous and consistent on the setup:

* 4 light types (3 LEDs and 1 laser) in exactly the same positions
* mineral oil negative control
* one sample of motor oil
* a calibration reference

We'd want to be really careful to not change anything except the light type. Does this sound like a good setup? Anything else you can think of to document or standardize to get a clear result?

After this initial test, we could try measuring a motor oil and a diluted crude oil sample, side by side. But let's separate out these tests, and examine one thing at a time, narrowly and well-controlled.
