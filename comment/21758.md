[@bsugar](/profile/bsugar) i had a quick question -- would it be OK to only collect /some/ of the related tags of each tag, i.e. limit the number of edges that we look up for each tag record? As of recently we have an optimized `Tag.related(tagname)` method that optimally returns the 5 tags most used with the given tag. 

In this code, I was able to collect the 5 most-related tags for each of the top 250 tags, and it runs in about 8-11 seconds on the production site:

I'm wondering if we could just reformat that to be the correct JSON format and then hand it off to `tagoverflow`?
