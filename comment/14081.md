When you get to the step here:

[![PortraitOblique.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/252/thumb/Schermata_2016-03-28_alle_18.03.32.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/252/original/Schermata_2016-03-28_alle_18.03.32.jpg)  

Note that it is asking for a "Photo Pair File." This is made with the plugin called "Create dual image list."

It's not clear whether you have done that or not.
