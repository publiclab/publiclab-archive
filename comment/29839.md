I've learned various of information from the video that I watched today in class. 3/4 of the Earth is covered by water and 1/4 of that is land. 3% of the water that covers the Earth is fresh water and humans are dependent upon freshwater. 10,000 tons of microplastics are dumped in the ocean every year. The largest water system in the world is the Great Lakes which consist of: Lake Eire, Lake Michigan, Lake Ontario, and Lake Superior. 50,000 to 100,000 pieces of plastic are dumped in the ocean everyday. Microplastics are everywhere and the solution to decrease the presence of microplastics is to lessen the use of plastics. Use less plastic; find less plastic.
