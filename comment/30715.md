FADAND: 
Fixation- Converting nitrogen gas into a more usable form occurs through a process called fixation. Assimilation- Plants take up nitrogen and absorb it into their organic matter via their roots. Decomposition- Animals then absorb those compounds by eating the plants. Waste material from dying plants, animals, and fungi, return the nitrogen compounds in the organic matter to the soil by decomposition.   Ammonification- Microbes or other organisms in the soil break down the organic matter into simpler compounds. Nitrification- Nitrifying bacteria found in soil or aquatic environments convert ammonia into nitrite then to nitrate. The compounds released from this process are all absorbed from the soil by plants and then utilized. Dentification- This process is when nitrate goes back into nitrogen using denitrifying bacteria.
