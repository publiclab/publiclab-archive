>>Most android devices support GPS (lat, long, alt).

Some day, more people will be using smartphones to take aerial photos, but today, a $40 (ebay) Canon Powershot takes much better photos (bigger sensor, better lens, better control) and is much easier to convert to infrared. Collecting GPS data for these photos generally requires additional (and more expensive) hardware, so it is not done very much, and we don't know much about the quality of the GPS data or how it relates to the ground position of the photos.
