I think the NDVI_VGRYM.lut color scheme is a good one to start with. What ever you use, include a key to the colors with every NDVI image you share. The camera depends on your needs (wide angle vs. not, light weight vs. not, crisp image vs. not, good in low light vs. not, cheap vs. not, easy to convert to NIR vs. not, etc). Some PowerShots are excellent compromises.
