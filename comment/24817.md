Hi [@Pablo](/profile/Pablo) sorry for any trouble! I do not have the camera physically in front of me, but there is a "timelapse" mode in the settings, i'm guessing it probably requires multiple presses of the Mode button to put it onto that setting -- 
[![s-l1600.jpg](/i/32953)](/i/32953?s=o) i bet it is very hard to find.
