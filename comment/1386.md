Yes, pointing at the sun is just too bright and will saturate detectors. The sky is problematic as the spectrum is probably related to angle from the sun, amount particulate matter in the air, and scattered sunlight is polarized to boot.  The best thing I can think of right now is to point the spectrometer at something white illuminated by sunlight, and that might also be too bright so use of a small piece of white on a black background or limiting the amount of sunlight striking the white material with some sort of aperture might be required.
White  printer paper contains "optical brighteners" to make it look whiter, and that would alter the spectrum so that is not too good.  So we would need some white that is easily accessible so many people could use the same thing.  Perhaps a common brand of flat white spray paint would be good.  Your idea of a diffuser is also good if we can come up with something cheap that anyone can get their hands on.
