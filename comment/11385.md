Hi, -- we're hoping to revise the videos soon but the interfaces may change again soon as well, so we're holding off for a little bit. Making the videos is a bit time consuming! 

I just confirmed that the compare-to-live feature is broken; do you use Github and would you be willing to post a bug report at https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/issues/new? That would be SUPER helpful. Thank you.
