and they didn't have a $10 consumer product with a servo loop speed regulated drive system and a removable wheel that cost almost nothing. You can make a very cool color synthesizing wheel that is half black half white with three different length black stripes on the white side then spin it. When it gets to the right speed the eye will see rgb.
