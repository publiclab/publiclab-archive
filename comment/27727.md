Hi Warren. I am interested in your kite-mapping camera rig for mobius or gopro, made from corrugated plastic:

However, I am a total novice at kite photography. Does one clip this to the grommet where the string attaches to the kite? Or do you fine a way to attach it to the string? Thanks for your help!
