Mathew, it seems I was not clear enough. The ftoroplast, or Teflon, is placed NOT BETWEEN layers of polyethilen which are heat-seamed. One strip of Ftoroplast (Teflon) is above the two polyethylene layers, and the second is under the two polyethylene layers. Ftoroplast prevents adhesion of the heated polyethylene to the iron, and to the backgound. The adhesion (welding) of two polyethylene layers is what we want. So no Ftoroplast (Teflon) between the welded layers. I'd better show this on photograph.
