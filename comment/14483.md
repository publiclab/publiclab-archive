All fluorescent lamps produce visible light when UV light from excited mercury gas excites phosphors coating the inside of the lamp. Most compact fluorescent lamps use the same phosphors, but there are a few different combinations of phosphors used in tube fluorescent lamps. [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_lamp#Phosphor_composition) has spectral intensity graphs for several types of lamps.

Most of the different lamp types produce peaks at about 435 nm and 546 nm because those are not emitted from phosphors but from the mercury gas which is in every type of lamp. Any of those lamps can be used to calibrate a spectrometer, but those two peaks in a CFL are much more distinct so recognizing them and lining them up is easier.
