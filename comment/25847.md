Hi Derek-

Great question. I'm in NYC, and I always rent a tank from an industrial gas supplier-- the kind of place you'd go if you're getting welding gasses, etc, but if you expect to be doing *lots* of mapping and have a place to store a tank, it can make sense to purchase (depending on how you work with your local supplier, sometimes a purchase just means that they'll swap out your empty tank for a full one when it's time to refill, or that you can get on their delivery route for refills)-- purchasing also means that you will still have any unused helium available for future use (though some places will refund a bit for partially used tanks), instead of having to do a pick-up/return each time.
