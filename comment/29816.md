Caleb Hall- 3/17/2022- The Relationship Between the term Microplastics, Biodegradability, and Sublimation.

      Microplastics are termed as bits of plastic pollution that are at most 5 millimeters in size. These types of plastics pollute many different ecosystems through disposal of Macro-plastics that have been eroded away, or already small bits of plastic made for industrial plastics.
    Biodegradability refers to an objects ability to be decomposed by bacteria or other organisms. Most organic material is easily biodegradable, but the issue with most plastics is that they are not biodegradable and can take hundreds of years to decompose. 
    Sublimation is the process in which a solid transfers directly to a vapor without becoming a liquid first. This process does not occur in just water, it can also occur in many other solids, and these solids are used in some household products such as air fresheners. Most microplastics are unable to sublimate, which when combined with their inability to biodegrade, they are essentially stuck in whatever ecosystem they are polluting.
