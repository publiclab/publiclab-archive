Hi caguldi03! Would you like to join an open call tomorrow? They happen every Tuesday at 2pm Central / 3pm ET. All topics welcome, you can see a few agenda items already, including this question that you posted.

Thank you for checking in on this! There's an aspiration to hold a three day event in Texas (Houston?) on the first weekend in November 1-4. These details are still flexible, and it would be great to try to advance planning on this.
