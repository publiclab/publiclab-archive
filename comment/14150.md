I think this is a super interesting idea. There would be, of course, a lot of caveats and assumptions made, but I'd be interested in exploring them. My first two skeptic's flags (because my brain quickly goes from "neat!" to "here's a litany of issues to think through" back to "neat!") are: 
(1) even if a substance isn't chemically sorbing, there can be physical sorption simply due to impact or settling (i.e. a particle could still land on it, even if it were chemically modified to select for certain gaseous molecules) that could impact weight measurements
(2) even the best functionalization only gets selective to a certain extent, so it'd be more likely to work for a "class of molecules" rather than a specific chemical itself. That's more of a detail about communication of results though.
I like the idea!
