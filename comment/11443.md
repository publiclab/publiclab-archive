Maybe it could show with a printer icon. Also if there are other things you'd like to improve about the print stylesheets, we should open an issue for that too. Some page content is hidden in print.css, like the navbar and sidebar. But we've added features since then so maybe we have to hide more thinks to ensure the page is tidy.
