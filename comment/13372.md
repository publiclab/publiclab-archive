That looks pretty good. With the defaults in the photo monitoring plugin, the plant leaves have an NDVI value around 0.3. We don't know what the NDVI values should be for those leaves, but that's in the right range.

It will be interesting to learn how consistent the results are among different photos. The camera is apparently using automatic white balance for each photo, and it probably uses the entire scene to make the decision. So if you zoomed in on just the plants, the result could be different.

Figuring this out is a great contribution.

Thanks,
Chris
