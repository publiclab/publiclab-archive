Yes, That's a main thing to think about. I was thinking the original user who posted the wiki, moderators and admin are good candidates for this ability. Because as any user can edit the wiki, the person who makes a suggestion could simply edit it. But the reason he makes a suggestion may be:

1. Person is not sure if he/she is correct
2. He want that change to be done by the original user
3. Or for some other personal reason. 

So I think resolve/accept/discard abilities should be given to author, moderator and admin. 

Thanks for your feedback and time. Please give any feedback as I'm very happy to know and correct my errors.
