Parth,

Good question. You might think that digital cameras were good examples of intelligent design, but they are more like living organisms which are cobbled together from the parts available in ancestral designs. The pixels that make up the blue channel are sensitive to blue light but not green or red. This is accomplished by putting a tiny blue filter over each individual pixel. It was too hard to find filter material that also blocked NIR, so a separate filter covers the entire sensor to block only NIR. When we remove that IR block filter, each pixel becomes sensitive to NIR as well as its primary color (R, G, or B). So the blue pixels record blue and NIR, but nothing else.

*Above: One example of the sensitivity of the three color channels in a camera from which the IR block filter has been removed. The blue channel (blue line) is sensitive to blue light (400 to 500 nm) and also NIR light (800 to 1000 nm). Each camera make and model may differ.*

When we then add a new red filter that blocks all blue and green, the blue pixels only receive NIR light. 

If digital cameras were built in a more straightforward and intelligent way, we would not be able to use them to analyze plant health.
