[@mathew](/profile/mathew) great comments and feedback, thanks. I totally agree, having the code in there is useful for some (probably few) but quite distracting for others (probably most). These notes were originally intended for just don and I (and me trying to teach don how to use R :). it wasn't until later that we started thinking about how to get them on PL for a larger audience. 

But moving forward, it will definitely take some work on my part to figure out this balance between code and other distracting details and the real meaning of the note (e.g. how well does the riffle track the USGS gage). 

I'm going to add a little button to my notes that will show/hide the code blocks for users who are interested (see [this example](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2013/04/27/comparison-of-nonparametric-and-parametric-approaches.html) with the show/hide button on the right of the page). I think I could do a similar type of thing where each section is collapse-able (code, text, figures, and all). So I think that will get us closer to finding the right balance here.
