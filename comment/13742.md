Oh my goodness, I realized that I have always assumed that fluorescence emission wavelength was relative to something inherent in the chemical structure, not based on the exitation wavelength! 

If that's true, then I totally agree, but that also means that we should consider:

1. how much data free of overlap do we need, and how might we measure or quantify that amount?
2. does the bandwidth of emission vary with exitation wavelength? If so, there could still be an advantage to careful selection of exitation wavelength
3. does *intensity* of emission vary with exitation wavelength?
