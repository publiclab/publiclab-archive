 Hi [@igniteeng000](/profile/igniteeng000) great work. First of all don't worry about the reviewal of the proposal. We will review it and suggest changes here at PL. We have ample of time till we have to decide the final selected students. So, you are not late. So, best of luck. We can plan out things in the comments. Apologies from my and [@warren](/profile/warren) side for not reviewing the proposal. 
Secondly, please upload your proposal on the Google Summer of Code website before the deadline. Do this at the earliest. Ignore it if already done.
