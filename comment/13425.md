Hi Parth,

There are a lot of options at infragram.org, so it's not easy to find the most sensible way to process a photo. I made the NDVI image below in the "standard" version, not the "legacy" or the "WebGL" version. I think you used the WebGL version, but the "fastie colormap" did not work for me in the WebGL version. The standard version did not display a color key. Instead of (B-R)/(B+R), I entered ((B-R)/(B+R))+0.09, then clicked run and selected the fastie colormap. The added 0.09 was needed because your photo is not exposed perfectly (few photos are).

*Above: Made at infragram.org. The color table used is the one in the image below.*

The NDVI image below was made with the [Photo Monitoring plugin for Fiji](https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/01-13-2016/packaged-photo-monitoring-plugins-available-on-the-github-repositoy). I used the defaults for a red filtered camera and the NDVI_VGYRM color table. Then I added 12 to the NDVI value in each pixel (Process/Math/Add).

Calibrating the process requires placing targets of known reflectance in your photos and using the process here: https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/07-22-2015/introducing-the-calibration-plugin-for-imagej-fiji
