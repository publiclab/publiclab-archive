Hi Parth,

There are a lot of options at infragram.org, so it's not easy to find the most sensible way to process a photo. I made the NDVI image below in the "standard" version, not the "legacy" or the "WebGL" version. I think you used the WebGL version, but the "fastie colormap" did not work for me in the WebGL version. The standard version did not display a color key. Instead of (B-R)/(B+R), I entered ((B-R)/(B+R))+0.09, then clicked run and selected the fastie colormap. The added 0.09 was needed because your photo is not exposed perfectly (few photos are).

The NDVI image below was made with the [Photo Monitoring plugin for Fiji](https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/01-13-2016/packaged-photo-monitoring-plugins-available-on-the-github-repositoy). I used the defaults for a red filtered camera and the NDVI_VGYRM color table. Then I added 12 to the NDVI value in each pixel (Process/Math/Add).

Calibrating the process requires placing targets of known reflectance in your photos and using the process here: https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/07-22-2015/introducing-the-calibration-plugin-for-imagej-fiji
