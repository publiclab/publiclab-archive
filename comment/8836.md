Sorry i was traveling last week! My bad. 

Whoa, cool - were you able to integrate it at all with the existing infragram-js code, like in a button that says "connect to remote camera"? Do you have a demo online and running?

You should join the plots-dev list if you haven't already and maybe the plots-infrared list ... lots of folks would be excited to see this there. http://publiclab.org/lists
