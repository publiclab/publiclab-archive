Hi folks that are on this thread. (Hello!) [@warren](/profile/warren) mentioned this convo and suggested I throw out a thing to get reactions: Mapping environmental lead exposure is an ongoing conversation happening out there; a number of people are doing it, mostly in silos (within their own city or state for example), and all trying to figure out the best variables. 

I wrote up a potential project idea here: https://publiclab.org/notes/read_holman/01-14-2019/seeking-gis-data-folks-help-us-create-a-nation-lead-exposure-risk-map?_=1547506494 

Would welcome thoughts, comments, etc (Should we actually have the conversation on that page?)
