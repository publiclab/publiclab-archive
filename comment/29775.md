The Mississippi River is important to me in various ways. The river is a vital source of hydroelectric energy, provides drinking water for millions of people, and supports many ecologically and commercially important fish species. The lower river directly supports 585,000 jobs and generates $151.7 billion. The river also supports about 1 million jobs. Pollution to the river would effect many of things. If the river was to be polluted, it would kill off plenty of marine life, which has an effect on our jobs and economy.
