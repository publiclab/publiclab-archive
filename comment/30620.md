Louisiana is losing coastline because of heavy storms, climate change, levees being built, and more human interference. This is dangerous because biotic life in Louisiana can lose their habitats. Even trying to restore it can lead to endangerment of certain fish species. It's like a domino effect. Levees lead to corrosion, humans trying to fix  it lead to a disturbance with the waters, that affects the fish, the change in fish can damage our economic issues in Louisiana.
