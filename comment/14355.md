Wow, "citizen scientist"! I have never thought about it that way. But you are right. I dived into PLab spectrometry by chance and found that it really sparks my interest in basic physics. How does a diffraction grating work (ask Mr. Feynman!), how does a webcam work, how can we make cheap spectrometry more stable? These are only some of the questions I asked myself during this ONE month of being here, of being part of the PLab community. And I am well aware that other guys here have other interests like hunting down oil polluters or doing bee science. I don't know any member here from the oil testing front personally but I do hope that some day someone here may find a solution to HIS research problems within one of MY thoughts about my research problems. We don't have to know each other, we don't have to work on the same problem, we just have to share what we find out. And thats so great about this community.
