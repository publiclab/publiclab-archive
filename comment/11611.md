Hi
I currently have a modified canon (IR block removed) with a wratten 25A Red filter.
My pictures are really nice looking but I have big problems with NDVI.
Here is a picture of mine with NIR on blue channel and Red on the red channel:
[![NIR1_Red3_b.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/829/medium/NIR1_Red3_b.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/829/original/NIR1_Red3_b.jpg)
I can, of course alter them, as mentioned on this post, and have the red on the blue channel and the NIR on the red channel, its like this:
[![NIR3_Red1_b.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/830/medium/NIR3_Red1_b.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/830/original/NIR3_Red1_b.jpg)
But when I calculate NDVI, if I only look at the image the values range from -0.83 to 0.14, but the pictures look nice, as soon as I change the range on the color ramp to -1; 1, because the values are extremely low, my NDVI turns like this:
[![ndvi.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/831/medium/ndvi.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/831/original/ndvi.jpg)
As if all vegetation were dead.

I have borrowed a MaxMax modified canon camera for NDVI II with great images, and made shure all parameters were the same in both cameras, and taken photos of the same object at the same time:
[![canon260.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/832/medium/canon260.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/832/original/canon260.jpg)
The NDVI on the MaxMax camera is great as you can see here:
[![canon_ndvi.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/833/medium/canon_ndvi.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/009/833/original/canon_ndvi.jpg)

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can calibrate my camera or post process my images to calibrate them, using the good camera?
I would really appreciate it.
Thanks again,
Rita
