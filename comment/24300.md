Hi Bronwen - I posted you the below question because it wasn't working but then after about half an hour the pi wifi connected!! So all good :) Despite your FYI I didn't realise it would be that long to connect! Thanks

I followed your link to the public lab pi builder site. I then followed the download link to GitHub https://github.com/publiclab/pi-builder/pull/53.

I followed jywarren's download instructions through to gitlab. (I have never used gitlab before so this is probably where I went wrong!)

I downloaded the artifacts zip entitled 'camera_web' which gave me a zip file and an img.zip.sha256 file.

I unzipped the other and used belenaEtcher to flash these onto my SD card.

I waited 10 mins from plugging in my raspi for the network but nothing showed.

I've attached screenshots of my process - any ideas where I've gone wrong?
