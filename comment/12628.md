I see that the 14 peaks you've chosen are sourced from the NIST data, not the Wikipedia/Ocean Optics data. 

OK, one last issue -- for intensities on the RMSE, I'm wondering if I can just use NISTs relative intensities, stretched to 0-255, or if enough of the peaks are **not** mercury, and so I should just use the intensities from the snowy sky spectrum. Thoughts?
