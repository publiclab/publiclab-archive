Ned, each "red" pixel in a 2x2 block typically has an intensity about 50% bigger than the either of the two "green" pixels in the same block. The *total* green intensity, i.e. the sum of the two green pixel intensities, is larger than the  intensity of the single red pixel though....in some sense the measure of the "green" light falling on a 2x2 block ought to be the average of the two green pixels.  That averaging improves the SNR by a factor of about 1.4, though, and the "green" spatial resolution is improved by having two pixels instead of one--some smart person should be able to figure out how to use that.
