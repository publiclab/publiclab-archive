Thanks [@hspencer22](/profile/hspencer22) , this list of easy-to-spot violations is helpful! 

I've been learning a lot from the posts by [@junior_walk1337](/profile/junior_walk1337) and the MMMP team, especially from their [series on observable permit violations](https://publiclab.org/wiki/the-mountains-and-mines-monitoring-project#Project+Outputs:+Learn+about+observable+permit+violations+for+coal+mining+with+the+materials+below).
