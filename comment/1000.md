i had packed them so that they were all grouped together in fours

sorry about those labels, those were my fault.  next time, will stick to painter's tape

there may be some other labels under the gaffe tape, but the tape tends to pull off the sticker

we know for sure that none of the ones with gaffe tape on the bottom are of the "open top" exposure method, so that may eliminate some...

but all of the ones you list would each have had one hole, and one hole made in the label--which is why i had to add a label.  so yes, the round labels are under the tape, but the tape will destroy the label...

hmm.
