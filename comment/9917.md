Who's talking about using a quad?  And who said anything about a platform that can fly 50 times? If I fly anything more than 50 times theres a very good chance it will have evolved into an entirely different craft by the time I reach flight [#50](/n/50).
 People seem to be passionate enough about this issue, which is strongly encouraged, but I strongly request commenters read the full post before posting any reactions.
