[@warren](/profile/warren) How do you start the timer?  I don't see a sensor for the start, only the end.  Another set of electrodes appear necessary.  Will that set of electrodes pop the bubble?

A bubble will have to be formed before air flow starts or you will blow bubbles thru the bubble juice which perhaps will be bad.. Unless the cylinder is kept very still (vertically) the bubble will not represent an accurate volume measurement.  

This configuration only works for blow and not suck.  An attachment for the tube would need to be fixed to the top where the hose would have to kept still during the measurement. 

I like the bubble management of the Buck.  Only a small rod to seal and the flow does not have to be interrupted to start a bubble.  Your gasket may have a problem with leaks

Can you add salt to a bubble solution to make it more conductive and still have good bubble forming characteristics?  Is it conductive enough (what ever that means) without adding salt?

The cylinder volume can be calibrated with water and a sensitive balance or accurate graduated cylinder.
