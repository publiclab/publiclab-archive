Yeah, [@warren](/profile/warren) I know its quite hard but at the same time, it is efficient as parallel work will be going on in plots2 repository. Conditionalized code would be there in many places and many files will be affected. But after we have successfully done the updating we can take time to remove these conditions. The removal of conditions can be done in 2 - 3 days. Also, we can keep it as a first-timer issue for the outreach programs. I will be updating these details in my proposal shortly. Thanks!!
