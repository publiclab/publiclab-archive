Hi, I think that would be great. I'm trying to do an install of `infragram` in one recipe here, and if that works, I may do the same for `image-sequencer`, and set it up to run automatically on all images taken. If you're interested in trying to open a PR for this, I'm happy to help get it moving! It'd be installing `image-sequencer` instead of `infragram`:
