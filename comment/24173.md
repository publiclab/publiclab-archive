 Wow! love the post [@sashadev-sky](/profile/sashadev-sky), its a really great post ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ (I think I have reread it like 3 times ðŸ˜ƒ ) and I really relate to everything you say.  [@warren](/profile/warren) I can't think of a better name, words that come to mind are "friendly", "involving", "welcoming", "open collaborative development". Love the "community-centric development" name really good.
