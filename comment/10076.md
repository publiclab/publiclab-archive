[@warren](/profile/warren) - Don't worry - the RIFFLE data visualization feature is a looooong way off.  To be honest, it's not likely that I'll get to it before the end of GSoC.  I'm focusing on integrating Vidun's and Anish's work right now, and eventually my own annotation plugin, and that is my top priority for the time being.

I was excited about [@mathew](/profile/mathew)'s suggestion to place RIFFLE data on the map and thought I would get the conversation started, even if I don't end up being the one who implements this functionality.
