Endangered species are animals that have a very low population throughout the world. Many things could cause a species to become endangered. Things such as low food and invasive species. One of the main reasons that could cause a species to become endangered is humans. Humans had cause endangerment and extiontion for years. Animals like the wooly mammoth has been killed off due to humans killing them for fur and meat. 

Humans aren't all that bad. There are people who try their all to help animals become nonendangered. They create laws such as no killing laws to help prevent people from killing them. They also capture animals and help them regain their population. One animal that was saved from dying off was the Panada.
