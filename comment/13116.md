Ah, great -- yes, that's what seems most sensible to me, too.  TMI:  By frequency I meant the "555 timer output frequency" for the conductivity reading ... for temperature the "raw" value would actually be a voltage measurement, given how we're measuring temperature (with a thermistor) currently.  But I've also modified our sensor board so that it can use a digital temperature probe, which would output Celsius units directly -- but would still (ideally) need to be corrected via calibration.  So sometimes a "raw, uncalibrated" can so far be a frequency (requiring conversation, including correction), voltage (requiring conversion, including correction) and degrees celsius (requiring correction).  Hah, isn't the world of sensors fun :)

It'll be nice to work out a consistent language for this ... or adopt one that's already in place ... maybe we just use "signal", as in "signal [#3](/n/3)" to refer to the third output in e.g. the CSV that the microcontroller records to microSD?  And then we can map conversion schemes onto signals.

I like the idea of *not* using units on the microcontroller directly, actually ... using something like "signal" gives folks / user the heads up that there is further interpretation / processing required if they want to assign meaning to that signal :)  But maybe there's a better word than signal?
