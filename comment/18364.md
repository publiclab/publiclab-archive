There has been a lot of information about measuring turbidity posted at Public Lab. Don Blair posted an [excellent review of the common approaches to making DIY turbidity sensors](https://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/08-25-2015/turbidity-001). His focus was to make sensors which could be attached to data loggers and deployed at a body of water, but the information is also applicable to a laboratory device for use with cuvettes of water samples.

Don found that the standard way to measure turbidity is to sense the light scattered by the water instead of the light transmitted through the water as you do with this design. So the sensor is placed 90° from the direction of the incoming light. Some turbidity sensors also measure the transmitted light because having both measurements can provide better information and maybe information about the size of the particles in the water.

Most of the designs discussed by Don use LEDs as the light source. The better devices also have a lens to focus the light into a beam. It might be that a laser works as well as an LED plus lens, but I'm not sure. 

Some turbidity sensors use visible light, but many use near infrared light. It's easy to find infrared LEDs and light sensors which detect near infrared. I don't know how critical the wavelength of the NIR emitter is.

Here is a potential BOM:

[Arduino Nano](https://www.ebay.com/itm/1-2-5-PCS-USB-Nano-V3-0-ATmega168-16M-5V-Mini-controller-CH340G-For-Arduino/263464866068) ...............$2.20  
[NIR LED](https://www.ebay.com/itm/20-5mm-940nm-IR-LED-Assorted-Infrared-Emitter-And-IR-Receiver-Diode-20pairs-5mm/332415142663) .......................$0.50  
[TSL2561 sensor](https://www.ebay.com/itm/TSL2561-Luminosity-Sensor-Breakout-infrared-Light-Sensor-integrating-sensor/272890567659).............$1.60

Total .............................$4.30

It's also easy to find [red lasers for under a dollar](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lot-of-10-Pcs-Mini-650nm-5V-6mm-5mW-Laser-Dot-Diode-Module-Red-Laser-Copper-Head/390565549526).
