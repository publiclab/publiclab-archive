On Ubuntu 18 via VirtualBox camera is visible to the OS and on spectralworkbench.org you get a request for permission to use the camera. However the state of the camera remains "Requesting camera access... ".

I then tried "guvcview" and I get this error:
V4L2_CORE: (get_v4l2_frame) video stream must be started first

I spent some time trying to resolve this issue, but I couldn't. I'll try older version of Ubuntu sometime later.
