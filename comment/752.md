From my standpoint I am a big fan of balloon mapping and all the work of PLOTS but as a layperson/out of context don't necessarily always understand what the produced maps are communicating (what is the brown thing? what was the map trying to measure/capture? who's involved and what is at stake?)

I wonder if it might make sense to try several of the lower-work methods (everything except building a standalone tool) around one or two maps and then compare results?

I'm a developer right now at Zeega and I'd be interested in working with someone using Zeega to see if it might work for annotating/storytelling around a particular map.

As a sidenote I'd love to learn how to make a Gigapan...
