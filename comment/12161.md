Hi Agustin - I have a feeling the problem with with the calibration targets you are using. The targets I sued for this note were scanned by a laboratory spectrometer so I know what the reflectance properties were. What I did before I had these targets was look for material that had reflectance properties published in spectral libraries. Look at my first calibration research note for more information and link to some libraries: http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/10-21-2013/calibrating-diy-nir-cameras-part-1

If you're doing calibration I suggest taking images in RAW format it possible. If that's not possible you need to remove the gamma correction (described above)  that was applied before the image is saved as a JPEG. The camera settings should make much of a difference as long as they are the same setting used when you took an image of the calibration targets. 

I did the correction on a photo that was acquired using a camera with a red filter. 

I hope that helps.
