I'm sorry but as usual the time difference kills me.
I could potentially listen in but at that time I cannot join the discussions (I'm too busy getting kids out of bed and into schools)

Could I request a recording of the discussions?
I'm particularly interested in the reasons people/communities might have to choose one sensor/platform over another and I'm sure that the discussion will continue beyond the event so it will be useful to have the recording as a reference.
