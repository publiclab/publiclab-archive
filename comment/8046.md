Thank you for this helpful advice!  This is exactly what I was hoping to hear!  I've edited the research note to include my most recent test results and a more detailed explanation of what I'm hoping to accomplish with the LED RGB lighting.  I'm well-aware that its a long shot, or at least a very long term project. But it seems like the emerging field of LED horticulture is ripe for the kind of disruption enabled by open hardware and citizen science.  Much remains to be learned in the science of Red/Blue spectra  and its effects on plant growth, but I could see a time when each plant comes with its own software profile on Github ;)  Want to grow tomatos?  Just grab the source code and apply the lighting configuration, ph/nutrient dosing and water flow timing to a Raspberry Pi/Beaglebone (or Arduino TRE if we're talking about the near future...)
