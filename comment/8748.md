Thanks Mathew and Chris! Chris, you were right that the soda bottle rig was hanging from a single line. It would be great to test out one of the Redstone Rig prototypes. Thank you for the offer! The group is considering another run at the beach, in addition to finding other NYC-based projects where we could kite- or balloon-map. Let me know how I can be in touch. Jennifer
