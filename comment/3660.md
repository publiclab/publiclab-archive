That would be very good news if the problem was lens distortion, because that can be corrected with a single click. I will look into that. The image of the diffraction pattern is centered in the photograph, and spans only a third of the photo's width. The lens is zoomed in to 9.64 mm from its widest focal length (6 mm).  So there should not be too much distortion. 

I fear that the flimsy grating film, which is not exactly flat, contributes to this issue.  One nice thing about a DVD grating is that it is stiff and flat. 

But it sure is nice to have a problem which can be solved with math. [#sleepwelltonight](/tag/sleepwelltonight)
