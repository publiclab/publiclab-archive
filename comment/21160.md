Hm. I wonder how close we are on a v4 upgrade. It'd add some chaos, but it's essentially "now or later" chaos. 

https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1716 is where we'd been discussing it. I'll pick that convo back up...

Did you want to try pasting everything into a demo wiki page as I had done on 'sandbox-3' and see how close we can get with minimal tweaks? Especially with the relatively narrower set of components that you've used in your welcome page design. 

Sorry about this, I hadn't noticed it was v4!
