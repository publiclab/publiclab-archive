I did this! A friend and I spent 4 hours working through this to make a 6ft wingspan delta. In the end the kite flew! But a minute after launch the spreader spar shattered, and thus ended the maiden flight.

I had a fair amount of trouble figuring out the dimensions. I think the spread sheet needs updating, several of the references seem off by one? I may take a crack at this, trying to have a sheet where you enter either the size you want or the size of the material that you have. I ended up using the ratios from [Dan Leigh's standard delta](http://www.deltakites.com/plan.html)

I also replaced the split ring+ tube for the spreader attachment with a 3D printed joint from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2166292
