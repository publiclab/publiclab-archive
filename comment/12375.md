HI Agustin - I put the images on my server here: https://resources.cbc.amnh.org/cbccloudstorage/public.php?service=files&t=12385a3a09a4879fcffc8da03052184f

The password is: filterTest

Please let me know if you have trouble accessing them. I put a readme file in the directory with information about the images and reference reflectance CSV files. If you do anything with these images please post your results here.
