This is great information. I don't know of any comparisons between DVD-R and DVD+R Do you think either will work for making a grating?

Some DVDs are double layer. The groove spacing should be the same, but they might be harder to split apart cleanly. Does anybody have any experience comparing single and double layer DVDs?

Below are some diagrams that helped me understand what we are doing. The lowermost layer (polycarbonate) is the part we need for a grating. The second layer from the bottom is the dye (recording layer) which must be the purplish stuff that has to be removed. The "reflective layer," or "Metal layer," or "Metal reflector" also has to be peeled away completely. The first image is a single layer DVD, the second is a double-sided DVD, and the third is a double layer DVD.
