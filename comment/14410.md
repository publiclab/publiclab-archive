[@viechdokter](/profile/viechdokter),

I would put in [@stoft](/profile/stoft) and [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)'s description as an additional process, which makes it immediately backwards compatible.

By "additional process", I mean that, wiki and research entries go in as usual.  Inside the database is a set of tables that hold the reviews for each entry.  An entry may have zero or more reviews.  If an entry/research note/data set has no entries, it is presented the same as everything is now on a search.

However, if an entry has one or more reviews, then a search that is sorted by "review rank" will place it appropriately, based on everything that is discussed.

Users who wish to focus on the peer-reviewed and -backed work will tend to look at the "review rank" sorting, while those who wish to see a wider view will have everything sorted differently.

That, at least, is my suggestion.  Most places make it one or the other, so you have Youtube (everybody puts up everything) vs. the online JAMA (where it takes a long time to get through the gate keepers...but it is certainly rigorous).
