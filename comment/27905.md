Besides get a lawyer who specializes in this information;

Look for Section 12 of the PSD.  

It contains the summary information for criteria pollutants.  

There's many things you can do with the summary information, but one of the immediate things you can do is plug those numbers into the  BENMAP-CE model, to get an estimate of the healthcare costs of the pollution.
