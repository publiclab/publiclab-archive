Yes, it did end up correlating.  I looked back over this article and realized I should probably post a follow up.  As expected, you start to get a graph that lines up with DO, but then shows bacterial activity once the DO is all used up by aerobic processes, and you start to get processes based on oxidizing Nitrite, which continue to cause the ORP to change.  I don't think I can make this next Open Call on Tuesday, but I'll try for the next one if you're interested.
