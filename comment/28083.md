Yes, Canada does have one. And it's a good one too.  Sorry, off the top, I can't pull the details to mind.  But the operation is similar.  
A "ham it up" up converter would work well for your nooelectric.  I tried some of the software fixes that would allow you to go lower in frequency.  They were not very good.  If you are doing meteor scatter, you can go down to 10 meters, but there are many other kinds of propagation .  I like a little higher than that.  Do you have your call yet?
