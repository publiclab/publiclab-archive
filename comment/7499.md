[@stoft](/profile/stoft) - the reference was just the UV laser. I didn't have an empty vial at the time but you're right that we should do that test. The sample is a very small amount of residue dissolved in mineral oil, which itself does not visibly fluoresce under UV laser illumination. You can see the preparation here: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/7-26-2012/oil-residue-preparation-spectroscopy

[@greggbone](/profile/greggbone) - great -- well, i think the first step is to begin scanning lots of oils with this technique -- to check for consistency and standardization. Questions:

* does the same oil scanned by 2 different UV laser setups generate very similar spectra?
* do two different brands generate distinct spectra?
* do two different bottles of the same brand generate similar spectra?
* does the type of sample container make a big difference? (i'm using these: )

All of the above would be good tests to run on crude oil samples as well, and on a variety of common petroleum pollutants, like motor oils. Interestingly, DTE Heavy oil (which we did test) did not fluoresce. I'll post that and a couple others soon, but I'll also have to dig out the "known samples" -- positive controls -- which I [ordered some months ago](/notes/warren/05-03-2013/crude-oil-samples-for-purchase-online)
