Hi [@Claytonb](/profile/Claytonb),

That's good to know. Did you compare the different channels to see if some showed any vignetting? A photo of an evenly lit solid field would be a rigorous test of this.

Do you know the thickness of the filters you installed internally? 
Have you examined the image quality (crispness) from edge to edge with the new filters in place? I have had trouble getting good focus when a glass filter 0.60 mm thick was installed internally ([see this note](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/01-19-2015/filters-in-focus)). I tested focus at the edges in photos of a subject far from the camera to mimic aerial photos.
