Hi! Public Lab recently put out a publication on Odor you can explores the articles [here](http://publiclab.org/forum). 

I'm not sure what people are usually spraying when they do this or if there are any regulations around this, so I've posted a couple other questions about it hopefully others can help with. You can find them all [here](http://publiclab.org/tag/question:crop-dusting). To get email updates when people post to those you can "like" the questions, or [follow the related tags](https://publiclab.org/tags) (crop-dusting, pesticides, agriculture, etc.)  

Also, are you available to join one of the Tuesday Open Call? It can be a good place to brainstorm with others- www.publiclab.org/open-call.
