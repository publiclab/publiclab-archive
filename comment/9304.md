RE: Mapknitter-
  I converted the images to JPGs and uploaded them again.  The export status dialog then reads (Status: Warping 1 of 6, 2 of 6 etc.) until it gets to 5 of 6 where it just hangs.  This is definitely an improvement over last time however wherein it showed no status at all.
  I did use DigiKam to convert the images to JPGs and I can't remember if I used it the first time.  I certainly hope the error doesn't trace back to DigiKam because it seems so well suited to the needs of batch editing.
