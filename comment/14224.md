Hmm, so it did a one hour wait, then started running on 4 minute cycle, without changing it from `countdown = 6`? 

Oh, i think there's a bug in the code. I'm making a new version, check out the same link. There's another spot where timing is set: https://gist.github.com/jywarren/4945996#file-periodic-js-L33

Can you try that? I also added a better note for how it should be configured.
