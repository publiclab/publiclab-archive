I noticed the same problem that jiteovien noticed but my solution was to use a popsicle stick under the Coroplast and placing the rubber band over that.  So there is a sandwich of a rubber band, a popsicle stick, and Coroplast.  I also don't use a rubber band on the back 2 bolts but do this on the front only.

Additionally, I cut an X in the Coroplast instead of a hole for the bolts.  It is then easy to keep the orientation in place with a minimum of hardware.  It just takes 3 bolts, 2 wing nuts, and 1 rubber band (plus the popsicle stick).  The only bolt hole that is not cut as an X is the one used for focusing and that one is just larger than the bolt.  This hole is sized best when there is little friction between the bolt and the Coroplast.
