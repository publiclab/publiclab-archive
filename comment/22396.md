The area of ground covered by an aerial photograph depends on both the height of the camera and the focal length of the lens. Lenses typically used for kite and balloon photography will cover a rectangular area with one dimension approximately equal to the height of the camera above the ground. So a Canon PowerShot with a focal length of 24mm (35mm equivalent) flown 300 feet high will capture a rectangle 300 feet by 450 feet. A Canon PowerShot with a focal length of 36mm (equiv) flown 300 feet high will capture a rectangle 200 feet by 300 feet. The PowerShot S100, S110, and S120 have an equivalent focal length of 24mm at the widest zoom. The PowerShot A495 has an equivalent focal length of 37mm at the widest zoom. Most point and shoot cameras are somewhere between these extremes.
