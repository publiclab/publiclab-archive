Hi [@liz](/profile/liz), as far as I can tell the Sentinel-5P spacecraft carrying the TROPOMI instrument transmits on the S and X-bands to the ESA ground station in Kiruna, Sweden. While this satellite is similar to NOAA sats in the sense that it is in low earth sun synchronous orbit at 824 km and it circles the earth every 101 minutes, it differs in its downlink frequency and quality, which has big implications for what kind of hardware / software one needs to receive a transmission. To compare, NOAA satellites transmit on the VHF part of the radio spectrum at 137 Mhz, but Sentinel-5P transmits on the microwave (2-4 Ghz) and 'super high frequency' (over 7 Ghz) part of the spectrum. From my understanding of these high frequencies, receiving such a transmission would require a completely different kind of antenna and set up to a turnstile or v-dipole which is what we use in the DIY Satellite Ground Station Guide. This is one kind of X-band antenna for example:

I need to do more research on this as I think there are other antenna options and some radio amateurs do communicate with Cubesats on the S band, I think. We would also need to figure out how to decode the data (it might be encrypted). Just some beginning thoughts. More soon!
