Another excellent lesson. But part of that lesson is that 25 mph winds are a problem that can be solved with money. A big soft kite like the Parafoil 10 (http://www.brooxes.com/newsite/BBKK/kitesales.html) or a sturdy delta like the nighthawk (https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/10-12-2015/pfk-nighthawk-debut-at-leaffest) can handle 25 mph winds if they are steady enough. You might also need 200-300 lb line and good gloves.
