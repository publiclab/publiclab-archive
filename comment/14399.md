Hmmm, my guess is that a realistic system for scientific material from such diverse sources cannot simply rely on a set of automated rules and search algorithms. At a minimum, such a system is inherently unstable under conditions which cannot be known apriori. Even just to prevent / cleanup the odd cases will require human oversight by 'PLab'. Even with game theory, it's extremely difficult to design a system which satisfies both technical standards and assures that everyone is motivated to 'play fair' WRT the same goal. It's not the creation of an 'elitist' class, it's to place common sense boundaries on a partially automated partially intractable problem.
