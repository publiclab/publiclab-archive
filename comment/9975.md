Very true, re: alignment -- is there any way to do a tiny tiny amount like a nanodrop while keeping the (possibly toxic) sample material sealed somehow? "micro cuvettes" or "ultra micro cuvetttes" narrow down to a slide-like width, but all square cuvettes seem to leak :-(

Here's an interesting one -- a round-topped, plastic, UV-friendly cuvette at $84 per hundred pack, $372 per 500: http://www.spectrecology.com/Disposable_Cuvettes.html or here on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/BrandTech-759230-UV-Transparent-Disposable-Ultra-Micro/dp/B003ULPARY

We'd need to buy really good sealing caps, of course.

It'd be too bad to use a specialty material, but we're already getting really particular about the jars, so they're not universally available either.
