On worldometer, we can see a close estimate of the world population. We are provided with numbers of deaths and births this year, and even today. Upon evaluation we concluded that births are nearly twice the amount of deaths each day.

Upon watching a video that projected Earthâ€™s population number and growth, we discovered that this estimation was over a billion off the actual numbers we are experiencing today.  

Our second video explained that every 15 years we are adding about a billion people to our population. It took 125 years to reach 2 billion for 1 billion, but since then the population has only increased exponentially. This is concerning because the bigger the population, the more scarce the resources will become. 

Today I also researched the migration patterns of particular species. Migration is a means of survival but also poses a threat by exposing the species to predators. Along with this research we discussed the three types of survivorship curves. I got to choose my own species to research and determine its survivorship curve.
