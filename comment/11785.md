To be a little more precise about "(potentially) remove the most expensive component, the flow control valve."  I have not priced them but an aquarium pump control valve or a hardware store needle valve should control the flow cheaply.  The problem is flowing 9 L of air thru the tube in roughly 30 minutes in an accurate, inexpensive, reliable, and easy manner.
