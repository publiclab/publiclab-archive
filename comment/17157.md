[@MadTinker](/profile/MadTinker), this is really exciting, and such important work for the promotion of community-collected data. Since the data streams you are discussing have such different temporal resolution, I think it makes sense to treat them separately and with unique confidence intervals for different precision, spatial and temporal resolution, and then see how they intersect. If there is reasonable agreement within confidence intervals, and low-cost community-collected data could serve baseline monitoring functions like USGS gauge stations, I would be *really* interested in discussing how to integrate data sets with different data quality in an easily communicated and visualized fashion. You have such an excited project!
