Ohh I get it now. Actually the data has 3 calibration  target, but i plan to increase it to 5 targets. I also wanted to know, how i can manually measure the pixel value through a rectangle selection in ImageJ. I tried using Analyze --> Measure, but all the calibration target that i measured through individual rectangle selection has similar range of mean values (250-255 range)
