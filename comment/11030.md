Ned, I have two question:

¿What do you think about using a field spectroradiometer for reflectance values of targets? Do you think that is necessary to repeat the measurements for each two hours during day? I thing that the effect of the sun azimuth and amount of light could be an issue but I'm not sure.

Thanks in advance.
