Holy Mackerel. SCIENCE!  This is a great use of the Public Lab spectrometer, and you are getting very good spectra with it. 

Does the RenekaBio assay kit come with a color card to compare with your samples? So you don't need a colorimeter (IORodeo) or a spectrometer to use the assay kit? If your goal was to see if there were subtle results that the eye might miss, did you have a reason to think that the chemical assay should have that much precision? Would the colorimeter work with LEDs of other colors? Why did you choose 415 nm? Am I asking too many questions?  I guess you are right that using a continuous spectrum bulb with the spectrometer will give you lots more information. It will be exciting and scary when you find a fruit in the unsafe zone. Then you can wash it to see if it gets safe again.

Very good stuff.
