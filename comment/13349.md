I just ran some new calculations looking at the curves from my existing data and found a possible correlation between oil density and the centroid of the fluorescence curve. I posed the results and plot in a new subsection above: "Spectral Curve Features". It may not be a linear relationship and there's questions from the dilution data but the results appear to be more than just chance.

Re: UV LEDs. I just did a quick DigiKey search for UV laser diodes. As one reference point, $15 will get you a 365nm, 1.5mW CW, 10% optical beam-width with a -6dB wavelength bandwidth of about 100nm. So, that 3X lower power than the pocket laser, a wide dispersion and wide bandwidth. LEDs do not present a simple solution.
