I also don't know if GPS altitude will be that useful when not at sea level -- since it's measured from sea level. We would have to do something like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1995998/android-get-altitude-by-longitude-and-latitude and that's too much at this point. Let's try to come up with some good defaults for starters?
