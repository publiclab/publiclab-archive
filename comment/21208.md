I found the information about the 640 nm wavelength lasers quite interesting, thank you. I have been in communication from people from Lane Regional Air Protection Agency in Oregon, and they believe that, since the sensors on the Purple Air monitor require air to be pulled up to the sensors, and that the flow is not high enough to get the PM10 particles to go through? What do you think about this, and also, if the air flow isn't high enough for PM10 particles to get into the sensors, why does the instrument tend to bias high with PM10 when the air flow may not be sufficient for it to capture PM10 particles? I'm very intrigued about all of this, so any help is greatly appreciated
