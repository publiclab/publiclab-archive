Hi! We just haven't had the manpower/time to do this completely, but there is plenty of documentation about setting it up yourself: https://github.com/jywarren/spectral-workbench/issues/206

and an installation guide: https://gist.github.com/YvesAD/5520784

There's also an "offline" version which lacks a lot of JavaScript debugging and isn't really working at this point: https://github.com/jywarren/spectral-workbench/tree/master/offline/

Finally, there's a very old and not well-supported Java version: https://github.com/jywarren/spectral-workbench/tree/master/spectrometry_kit
