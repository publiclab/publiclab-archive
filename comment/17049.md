Hm, so the PowerShot S100 actually fudges pixels to correct lens distortion? But you turned that off for this test picture? Or was this precorrected already? 

You can save a picture with a right click and `Save as...`  - but if you could upload a before/after pair here, so we can see the change, that'd be best. Thanks!
