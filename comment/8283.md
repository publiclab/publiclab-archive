Hi Liz, we asked ourselves that [same question](https://twitter.com/publiclabesp/status/423025890553905152) about the laboratoriopublico email list. Still unclear!

Now, people participating in the list are from Spain, but potentially (and in the past with Perú) it is for anyone speaking in Spanish. We'd love to see people from other regions. I guess we have to see how it develops and then decide its future. Your thoughts?
