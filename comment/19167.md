Thanks [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet) for your suggestions.
One thing I would to say, we should have symmetry with the providers. All providers should be able to be linked or unlinked to the profile or none of them. This will not leave the user in ambiguity. So, from my point of view all providers should be linked/unlinked via the edit profile.

Also, I agree the case of github, facebook and google. We could send them an email and ask them to change their passwords after they receive an email of username and password. But that way there would be three problems 

1) The username is some sort of random number so the user will have difficulty in remembering it. We cannot give the user the ability to change the username ,right!

2)A user is having different emails for different providers. So, that way the new user will sign up via different accounts and then he will have different accounts at PL. We will not have any way to merge the information of the different accounts. That will be a big mess. When the user would sign up through different providers, he will expect the same content.

3)Consider the case when user has an account with email address X on public lab traditionally and now he signs up through fb with email Y. So he will have two accounts. 

Making of the duplicate accounts is something which we need to deal, I guess so not giving the user the ability to directly sign up would be the best. He can link/unlink his different providers from his user account would be best.

Does it make sense?
What do you say [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet)??
