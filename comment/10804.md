I think so. Those tubes require one pump on the Draeger Tube proprietary pump. So if one were to rent their proprietary pump for a single day and attach a flow meter to it (preferably one of the higher end ones with a large monitoring range), then you see what the flow rate through the tube is and that could likely be replicated by an inexpensive pump-turned-vacuum. 

Their sampling seems to only take 55 seconds, so perhaps the flow rate is much higher than in the method above. If that is the case it, and a cheap aquarium pump could not muster that much pulling power then one could experiment to see if a longer sampling time with a equal total volume pulled through the tube would yield the same results. (when conversing the the lab that made the tubes I used, they were not positive that such a method change would yield precise results but it sounds worth some experimentation!) 

Yesterday I was at APHA and heard mention of H2S biomonitoring in urine (but I can't quite remember the metabolite that would be assayed) . Would be interesting if pH like test strips could be made for H2S biomonitoring.
