[@warren](/profile/warren) I was planning to do incremental update for rails 4.2 and rails 5.0. For that we would have to build a Gemfile which would support both 4.2 rails update and rails 5.0.1 updates. Also we would have to support tests for multiple versions in travis CI. I have started reading about it  and I would soon update you once I am ready to do it. Also I would like to add some tests that are compatible with rails 4.2 first and then rails 5.0

And for the rails 4.2 update I would definitely like to work on that PR.
