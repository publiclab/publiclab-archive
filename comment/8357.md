Hi Jeff,  I downloaded the eagle files that you can get to from the link that you reference and used the measurement tool in eagle to get the header spacing.  The holes line up exactly at 0.2" on the eagle file.  Do you have one of the Visualight devices in hand?  If so, you could check to see if it has the four holes as per the eagle files, or if it has five as per the Fritzing diagram.
Whether Don's plan is too complex depends on who is building it.  If you are sending it out to be fabricated, then no.  On the other hand, not many customers will want to put it together with a soldering iron. I don't know what the fab house will charge you to build these.  Whether is is worth it depends on the cost of the Visualight devices and how many you expect to sell.  You could put together a kit that has the pcb, sensor ($12.50), resistors, capacitor and header ($1.66).  The total should be under $16 and someone with minimal experience should be able to put  it together in a half hour.
Jack
