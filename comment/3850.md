Reposting a comment that somehow slipped through the cracks:
>Comment by kscottz: Hi Guys, I am one of the SimpleCV devs and I noticed your post. I think we work together to fix your issues and create a better library all around. Can you either toss a post up on our help forum (http://help.simplecv.org [1]) or file an issue github and we'll take care of it just as soon as we can.

Hi kscottz,
  We are trying to do image registration (affine alignment) with shots taken from slightly different viewpoints.  The issue I believe was already raised a while ago in [this thread on your help forum](http://help.simplecv.org/question/212/stitching-images-together-after-finding-keypointmatch/).
In the reply by "Rishi Mukherjee" he gives a link to a patch that he wrote which makes a change to the homography matrix of the method ```ImageClass.Image.findKeypointMatch``` in this [github pull request](https://github.com/ingenuitas/SimpleCV/pull/63/files).  I cannot vouch for the sanity of this patch, but I can confirm that the homography matrix that it exports is compatible with the function
```cv2.warpPerspective```; whereas, the method in the latest ```pip install SimpleCV``` (v1.3) exports a
homography matrix that gives an incorrect/incompatible transformation that is rotated and somewhat distorted.  I don't know that much about image manipulation, but maybe the problem has something to do with the different conventions used?
