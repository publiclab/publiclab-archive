Fabulous post, Scott. Thanks! For each of these situations, would the process be to try to convince Louisiana DEQ that there is oil and that the oil is not from consumer use/automobiles, and then DEQ would make the company clean up their act? For the landfill, if they are already operating without a permit, would there be anything to make them accountable? On Grand Isle, would discerning crude from refined oil be enough to warrant a response from the oil companies, or at least from DEQ to do further testing to try to identify a source?
