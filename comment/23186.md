On the landing view-port a user should be able to  know what Public lab is all about.
Maybe your tag line and short description about public lab should be on landing view-port.

Apart from the description on the view-port we should also have the call to action button like the sign up button
instead of it being down the page since you need more users signing up.

Your site should also have color themes.

These are some of the projects I've worked on https://podiihq.com  http://abhsound.com/  https://baselinkgroup.com/ https://academy.podiihq.com/
