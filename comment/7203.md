Ned,
Those orthomosaics are terrific. There sure were a lot of canoes on the river that day. 

Was the big one made using the GPS data in the EXIF header of the photos? Could Photoscan do it without any GPS data?

The S100 and S110 have good built-in manual control of ISO, shutter, focus, aperture, etc. What was the advantage of using a CHDK script, other than as an intervalometer?

Most importantly, are those channels to the marsh ponds in the second image maintained by otters?
