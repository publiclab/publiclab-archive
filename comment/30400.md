Over 1 million marines were affected by contaminated drinking water. Fuel had more than an impact but an adverse effect on the environment. The Clean Air Act (CAA) was created to purify the air for the people's safety. As well for the (CWA) Clean Water Act that was established in 1948 and (CSA) the Clean Soil Act. Testing found that drinking water sources of Camp Lejeune were contaminated with substances such as Benzene and (TCE) Tetrachloroethylene. Many people were carcinogenic indicating they were at risks of more than one cancer such as breast, leukemia, brain, bladder, cervical, liver, and more. After people found out what happened at Camp Lejeune the (CWA) became involved in the lawsuit of the Camp Lejeune. The lawsuit still goes on today due to its violation of clean water. In 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act (CWA) to remove toxic substances from water and to keep it clean.
