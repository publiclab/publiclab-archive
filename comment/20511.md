[@jiteovien](/profile/jiteovien) So cool to see that large testing equipment next to your little Dustduino! Anyway, your need for a waterproof set-up reminded me of work done by Shannon Hicks for the Mayfly Board at Stroud. You can check out the case she uses here https://www.envirodiy.org/mayfly/. I know with a setup she helped me with we had to drill a hole and use a connector with bladder to allow for the sensor we were using, but things remained waterproof. She also uses a special paste to prevent corrosion on solder joints. Sorry I don't know what the paste is called!
