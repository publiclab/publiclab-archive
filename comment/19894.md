Hi [@the_butler](/profile/the_butler), welcome to Public Lab! I see you've tagged the MACA Open Air Quality Monitor project. Your question is now appearing on their methods page: https://publiclab.org/wiki/maca . I see that there are links to some of their repositories on that page, but if the files you are looking for aren't there, perhaps [@nanocastro](/profile/nanocastro) can help you.
