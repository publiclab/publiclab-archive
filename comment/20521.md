That's very tempting, but I'm not sure I can add another thing to the plate this year. I still have several important new features to add to the core of the design and with this years intensive fieldwork schedule, and our academic collaborators asking for more units, I'm really fighting for scraps of time.  I also want to run those new features by another crop of Trish's undergrad students, as that always results in insights that make the loggers easier for beginners to build.

I feel bad to pass up this opportunity (...again...), because PublicLab is one of the best organizations in the entire citizen science movement. But I also know that everyone will want what I'm currently working on even more than what we've already done. There just is not enough time in life..
