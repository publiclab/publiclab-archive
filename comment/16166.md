Hi Liz, do any of the creators have public lab usernames? I'd love to learn more about the uploading process and whether other groups could use this tool for their own image sets. It look like perhaps you have to download the gigapan app or potentially pay for a gigapan membership?

This is such a great way to share a time-lapse and be able to browse it.
