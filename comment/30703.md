The largest concentration of nitrogen is likely to be found in soil. Animals need nitrogen to survive.  The transfer of chemical substance through living and non living substances: biogeochemical cycle. Weathering, absorption, decomposition, and sediments is apart of the phosphorous cycle. After decomposition it goes from organic to inorganic. Organic is when plants and animal excrete phosphorous.
