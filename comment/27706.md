It's important to do some of your own research about the landfill ahead of time.. what kind of contaminants are you concerned about? What was buried in the landfill?  It can be fairly expensive to test, so you will want to do as much research ahead of time as possible. Is there water involved? upstream vs downstream testing may be a good strategy..
