RQ, 

The white balance looks good. I think those are the settings used by Public Lab. But experimenting with similar numbers could produce better results for you.
The focus does not look very good. You should be able to get much crisper photos. But if your goal is NDVI, crisp focus does not matter.
Your photo produces a reasonable looking NDVI image.

You should be able to differentiate plants from non-plants most of the time.
