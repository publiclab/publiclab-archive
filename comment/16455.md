Dear Chris,
                  Thanks for sharing the publication. My main purpose is to test the potential of calculating NDVI using modified infrared mobius actioncam (factory modified). My objective includes the efficiently stitching the multiple images (~ 80 images) collected from DJI Phantom 3 Professional and running the algorithm for calculating NDVI. However, i have not quite focused on calibrating the NDVI images due to which my initial flight data didn't work good. So, i trying to figure out best way to calibrate the images for NDVI. 
I have mobius actioncam modified infrared with 87 mm Standard A lens fitted with red filter by public labs. But due to the wide angle lens i have huge distortion and fish eye effect so i plan to buy 6 mm modified infrared security lens from public labs. Which filter would you suggest me to add to my upcoming 6 mm security lens, as for now i have been suggested by Frank(a member of public labs to add the blue filter). I wanted to know your views before purchasing it.
Is the red filter from public lab infragram project similar to Wratten 15 filter as you mentioned above?
