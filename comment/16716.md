Some initial results using your white balance settings are impressive, however in this particular picture the roof of the house is showing high photosynthetic activity. The camera i have used is Mobius Modified Infrared Camera from Public Labs with red filter gel and wide angle lens , the photo was taken at a height of 150 feet. I think i should follow the procedure by Ned where he asked his friend to scan the spectroradiometer to create my own custom white balance.
Do you think i need the targets  of known spectral reflectivity in the same bands that will be used to compute NDVI or it can be tested with any materials as mentioned by Ned.

Also, do you have any idea how could i possibly validate my final end results of NDVI ? Do i need to take spectroradiometer measurements in the field as well to validate ? If you have validated it can you explain the process of validation.
