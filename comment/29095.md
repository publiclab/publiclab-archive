One additional note about algae formation.  It's not uncommon to have high algae formation even in untouched waters.  I have been backpacking in Colorado to lakes where there are no human settlements upstream and the entire bottom of the visible portion of the lake was algae biofilm, as well as the stream exiting the lakes for probably a half mile was also covered in biofilm anywhere the water was slow moving.  The area was only accessible by foot or horseback and was about five miles upstream from the nearest building or road.

I wondered how there could be enough nitrogen to support it, I can only assume that the percolation through the soil must carry sufficient nitrogen to supply the algae or that there are sufficient nitrogen fixing bacteria in the biofilm.
