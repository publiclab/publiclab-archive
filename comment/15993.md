Hi [@jeffalk](/profile/jeffalk)! Thanks for your help!</br>
That's not a basic question. That's in fact the kind of answer we've received from Shinyei, that every sensor has "different specification". We've asked a little bit more as we do not understand if they mean that the position of the potentiometers (as phisical screws) must be different depending on each sensor or that same resistor of different sensors will give different resistance. Our question is related to a multimeter measurement. Not precise, but yes aproximate. </br>
We've wrote also to Seeedstudio folks since Shinyei customer service has told us that SeeedStudio is not their distributor, so they doubt their source of the sensor...</br>
In relation to the conversion from counts to concentrations, since I'm not a techie maybe can help that we're doing the test using the Dustdino Serial code from Dustduino.org.</br>

PS: sorry but the links were empty. Data from those 48+48 hours are now availeable ;)
