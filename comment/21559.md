 Hello again [@warren](/profile/warren), [@liz](/profile/liz), [@roberts_ecofarm](/profile/roberts_ecofarm), [@read_holman](/profile/read_holman) (and everyone else!),

I've started working on the design of the dashboard. This is by no means a final design, so please keep your comments coming :)

You can find it here: https://edieblu.github.io/pl-dashboard/

Let me know what you think! 

Thanks!

Kind regards, 
Eva
