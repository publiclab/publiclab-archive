Very interesting that being ‘photo hobbyist’ and shooting only for  ‘aesthetic and recreational’ purposes” is not covered by the first amendment. 
I guess you should always claim that you are trying to tell the 'truth' through your photography to the world, so as to be defended. Telling the 'truth' is always a flexible concept, as we learned in Tim O'brien's "How to Tell a True War Story".
