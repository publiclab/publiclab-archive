Hi [@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro),
We started out using computer vision to analyze simple strip tests like you can get at your local hardware store for their ease of use, immediacy of results and low cost. However, after doing a controlled study comparing the strip tests to lab-tested samples (results published at AWWA ACE17 https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tWOEIZ0yhNs9g3sK5bJtTwx7ldODiI5RVTMbwwwxxHw/edit?usp=sharing) we concluded that these tests were insufficiently reliable. So we instead pivoted to utilize a rigorous early AM 1st & 2nd draw sampling with 1-2 minute flush protocol and processing the samples in a lab. By utilizing web-forms on the tester's smart phone, we're automatically capturing the time of day, duration of flush, geolocation, and camera images to assure a high level of data integrity and traceability. In the bigger picture, I see crowdsourced testing/mapping of our public resources as being somewhat independent of any one test type and can imagine it changing as new technologies develop. It may even be possible to think about a consortium of different test types being utilized to optimize resources so that faster/lower-cost tests could help more quickly identify issues in specific locations and points in time that could then be followed up with more detailed testing methods.
Hopefully that answers your question, but happy to discuss more.
Cheers, Sean
