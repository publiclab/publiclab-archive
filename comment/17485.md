<a href="https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/835/original/A_Pocket_Guide_to_Grassroots_Mapping.docx"><i class="fa fa-file"></i> A_Pocket_Guide_to_Grassroots_Mapping.docx</a>

<a href="https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/834/original/A_Pocket_Guide_to_Grassroots_Mapping.pdf"><i class="fa fa-file"></i> A_Pocket_Guide_to_Grassroots_Mapping.pdf</a>
