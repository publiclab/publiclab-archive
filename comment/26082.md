I haven't tried that Feather combination. I have also never seen a list of Feather-Featherwing combinations that are incompatible. So I assume it will work.

Depending on your goals, an ESP32 board could be a much cheaper solution. ESP32 has integrated Bluetooth and a board costs $6.00. It will cost a few dollars more to add data logging to SD card (RTC, uSD board, uSD card), but if the data are being sent to a mobile device in real time, the data could be logged on that device. That won't work unless the mobile device is always present, so another solution is to send the data via WiFi to the internet where it can be logged and viewed on mobile devices. That requires available WiFi but only a $3.00 ESP8266 ([like this](https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/01-10-2019/what-would-you-do-with-sensorship)).
