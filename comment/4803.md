NOOO!!!  that is terrible! I always thought of those spars as over-built, and have flown in higher winds...  Its telling that it happened right at the ferrule.  A stronger alternative would be to not use a ferrule on the spreader, or to use a three-part spreader with two ferrules, so the ferrule isn't right in the middle, where maximum stress concentrates.  

Bamboo has a much better strength to weight, and its flexibility is superior for a spreader.  A whole culm is problematic because it doesn't bend evenly, and ferrules can crush the hollow cylinder.  I'd try to match two culms and put their wider ends in the middle.  The bottom of the culm might be thick enough not to be crushed, but perhaps consider filling the culm with either a dowel or maybe epoxy before putting it in the ferrule.  Or maybe try a fiberglass spreader (ick!).
