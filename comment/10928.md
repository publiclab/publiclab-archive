Thanks Chris :) 

As far as I know, this seems to be the standard way to compare absorbance spectra...But modelling part may vary depending on the tools and their limitations. For example, automatic exposure control (which is disabled in the webcam comes with the desktop spectrometry kit - as far as I know - am I right? Jeff, Mathew ?) problem you have may be solved by looking into RGB channels and some ratios between those bands (similar to NVDI may be?) and defining that as a metric (which may be not affected by automatic exposure control) can be used to model the concentration variations. Mathematically speaking, as long as you decide the right modelling scheme (depending on the problem you have in your hand), you can come up with a way to measure whatever you want to measure...

And, I never discard my samples after I am done with data collection :)
