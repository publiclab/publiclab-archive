While the logger core is generic, surface deployments tend to use the 4" housing (which is easy to build) while the underwater deployments (~ half of the current fleet)  use the 2" body style. Usually those deployments are too deep to record with our little point & shoot camera, but we recently did an install in a coastal outflow that was shallow enough to capture a clip of the method we use to anchor the sensors in place. In this video we are placing the anchor in the faster flowing fresh water, with extension rods to move the actual sensor into the zone where saline water (the silty brown layer) in intruding into the system.
