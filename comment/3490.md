I see similar models for <$200 on ebay:

but of course that's because it's >30 years old and you have to read out the wavelengths one at a time by turning a dial :-)

Classy! On Ebay, you can also see the brand name change as the company was presumably acquired by different parent companies. I believe it eventually became part of ThermoFisher Scientific.
