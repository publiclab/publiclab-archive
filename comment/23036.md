Can you measure pure water? Probably so! While largely transparent in the visible water absorb in the 700-850nm range, note that to image in that range you will need an IR enabled camera as the IR blocking filter will block that range.
A great book with a short excerpt on this is [Optics in the Air](http://spie.org/publications/book/2263345?wt.mc_id=mspieprogbw&WT.mc_id=MSPIEPROGBW), it refers to two papers:
[Pure water](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/2258/0000/Optical-properties-of-pure-water/10.1117/12.190060.full) and The [color of the pools at the  Yellowstone National park](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-54-4-B128)
