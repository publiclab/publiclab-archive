My chia seeds are taking a while; I really like the idea of testing the camera out with sprouts, because

a) it's pretty neat to see in timelapse
b) it's a fast, low-risk way to test things out over 24 hours, and people may be more comfortable sharing sprouting pictures than environmental monitoring pics, esp. in sensitive areas -- but then can still help build out the documentation
c) you know something's going to happen, which isn't necessarily the case for in-the-field testing, so it's a good test run

I was hoping to capture a timelapse kind of like this one, via [BeatriceBiologist.com](http://www.beatricebiologist.com/2014/03/go-sprout-go/):

But my seeds haven't sprouted, so I'll give it a couple more days and also look around for mung beans and lentils!
