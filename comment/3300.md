Thanks for the thoughts Tom.
I got a 4" magnifying glass at the dollar store (2x magnification) and mounted it in a shoebox. I was able to determine the focal distance from the lens with a sheet of paper (11 1/2"). When aimed at a streetlight, I can focus the light's image on the spectrometer's aperture slit, but unfortunately have not had success at getting a reading. This set up is terrible for getting optimal alignment as everything has to be hand held at the moment. 
On the bright side, I can successfully run two 10 foot USB extension cords from my PC to the spectrometer.
Pictures are not posting for me, but here's what it looks like:
