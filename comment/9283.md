I can't tell if there's something it's choking on in your images (maybe 'cause they were screenshots from VLC?) or it's having trouble downloading them from Amazon s3 after up you upload them. It errors with:

`identify: magick/splay-tree.c:880: GetValueFromSplayTree: Assertion `splay_tree != (SplayTreeInfo *) ((void *)0)' failed.
Aborted`

but that's not very helpful, and could just be what happens when you call `identify` on a nonexistent image? But when i run identify on a truly non-existent file, i get `identify: unable to open image `sadjlfkads':  @ error/blob.c/OpenBlob/2489.` so maybe there's really something it can't deal with in the images...
