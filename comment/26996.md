Thank you [@liz](/profile/liz), I appreciate the support very much! I used 81 photos for this 3D model, which admittedly took a while to run on my laptop. 

I have learned more is not necessarily always better where 3D image reconstruction using structure from motion and choosing the location of where one takes the images, i.e. so that each section of the objects are encapsulated in a region where everything is captured but not taking too many multiple shots at the same spot.
