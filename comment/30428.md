There are many reasons why we should study environmental science. 
Environmental science will keep you informed about environmental problems. Some problems are global warning, climate change, depletion of Ozone layer etc.  By researching and investigating complex environmental issues, students develop and enhance essential skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and creative thinking. Environmental science is a degree with excellent career prospects, as well as opportunities for further study.
