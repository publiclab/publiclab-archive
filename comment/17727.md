What if we could start by compiling some examples of interpretation (Chris has posted some great ones), and try to note what were the "givens" that enabled the analysis to work. That way, people could look at an example similar to their own site of interest, and at least know what they have to do before they'll be able to do an analysis (i.e. troubleshooting or controlling specific variables like lighting conditions). 

I love Chris's list here: 

* poor photography
* poor processing
* presented without a color key
* limited context

Can we expand on these a bit to have a list of things to look out for? There are plenty of examples of people working through these issues through Q&A from the past few years, so maybe we can do better to list out and thoroughly answer peoples questions (if possible) on these subjects while providing more/better guidance on doing the analysis once they've gotten past these issues.
