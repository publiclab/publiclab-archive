Aanalyst (a model of atomic absorption spectrometer that we had)hollow cathode  lamps new are running for about $350.  So when there are hollow cathode lamps advertised on ebay for $20, there's probably something wrong.  It's usually that the hollow cathode lamp is nearly dead.  If they have a running time meter on the hollow cathode lamp, And it shows low running time,it might be worth the gamble. 
 Otherwise....
