Hi, just wanted to note that I left a comment about the recruiting and community coordinating portion of the project, which I like that you've begun to sketch out here -- just some ideas and thoughts you might like to read over as i noted on this other proposal! https://publiclab.org/notes/YogeshSharma01/04-04-2021/gsoc-proposal#c28481 

Thanks!
