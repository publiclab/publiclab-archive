Very cool! Where is this project located? I especially like the use of recycled/scavenged building materials, but am a little concerned that working with MDF, which is simply laminated paper, may be more trouble than it's worth if you're planning to use it in or near water... it my experience it distorts and dissolves pretty quickly in the presence of moisture, so you might find yourself spending more time on waterproofing/maintenance/replacement than you'd like, but I'm really excited to see where this goes. I'm also a fabricator, so I would love to hear more about your construction ideas and challenges, and am excited to see where this goes!
