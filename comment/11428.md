Multiple licensing is not a big problem, but can get a bit messy, as it's important to note the license under which other contributors add refinements. If all contributors use both, that's fine. But you could, if you like, note in the descriptions on Thingiverse that you are *NOT* using CC-BY-SA, and that it is only shown because Thingiverse does not enable people to choose the CERN OHL. 

Another note is that if you tag your wiki page with "tool" it will [show up on the tools page](/tools), which as of recently is sorted by what's been most recently updated. Hooray!
