Hi [@iresal](/profile/iresal),
The correct integration time is the 15 ms time.  I think that is the minimum time to read the data from the output pin. The 4 ms value in the code is not ever used. 
I took a look at the main.c file in the code you reference.  I am not sure that I understand how it works.  I did not see how you drive the clock (phi M).  It looks like you are using the main system clock at 80 MHz to run the SH and ICG pulses using PWM.  Is that correct?  It also looks like you are pulsing the SH pin at 400 microsecond intervals and the ICG pin at 40 ms intervals.  If this is true, then you are asking the pwm counter to count up to 3.2 x 10^6.  The reason I abandoned the pwm approach to pulsing the SH and ICG signals has to do with limitations on the counter in the pwm module (which I am using).  This module will count to 65535 (16 bits).  It looks like you are not using the pwm module.  Since the timers can be configured for 32 bits, so you may not have that as a limitation.  I do not know.
Have you been able to hook this up to an oscilloscope and see it work? 
Best,
Jack
