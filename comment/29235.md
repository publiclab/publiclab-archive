John Amos of Skytruth.org graciously looked this up on PlanetScope imagery, and got a before and after.  

"Although it seems highly unlikely, this spill was visible from space.  I highly doubt that satellite imagery will normally be this useful, though, as the nurdle spill is very hard to discern--it has no shape, although the size is roughly a rail car, the glare from the albedo of an all-white material gives it a large halo.  at a glance, it looks the same as a white-roofed building."  --John Amos, Skytruth.org
