your photographs are beautiful! Actually, you don't need a prism inside the spectrometer, that's what the DVD piece does, the slit only allows  a certain quantity of photons into the detector and as they hit the DVD grating they are diffracted into their constituent parts...hence, a spectrum!

The RGB channels make all colors, they are called the primary colors, secondary colors lie between the primary ones, a good example of this is here: http://icn2.umeche.maine.edu/newnav/Homepage/highschool/Primary_Colors/primarylect.htm

What's your dog's name? I ask because I just love animals, I have 3 cats.

have a good one my friend!
