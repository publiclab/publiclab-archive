 Hi! a couple updates that may offer some solutions here. First, organizationally, i've been starting to separate out activities into "build it" vs. "use it" -- and sometimes more. For example, the Community Microscope page now has separate listings for building the kit and using it:

https://publiclab.org/micro

Second, you may notice we have more grid types now, especially "thumbnail grids" which display images. This was a long time coming but a new contributor `@ValentinaTironi` (on GitHub) did a great job and we'll be rolling these out for other grid types too. There are also now note/wiki combined grids, and some other interesting variations you can read about at https://publiclab.org/wiki/advanced-grids. 

You can also now use grids in comments... 

[notes:grid:coqui]

(well, maybe not on questions pages? I'll figure this out.)
