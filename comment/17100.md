[@DavidMack](/profile/DavidMack), that's very true about the expense, but the lids are usually metal and so hard to clean. Depending on the analyte of interest, metal lids could be okay though. For sealing, are you thinking pressure sealing the jar (like when making jam) and then puncturing the lid to wire out sensor, or using for tools that wouldn't need a direct water contact sensor (like a turbidity sensor with the photodiode pressed up against the glass or a temperature sensor that could be corrected for offset from the water)? It's in interesting idea!
