Hi [@Bronwen](/profile/Bronwen) I'd love to make a connection at Newtown Creek Conservancy and the North Brooklyn Boat Club if you wouldn't mind putting me in touch. My email is sean [-at-] citizenspring [-dot-] org. Here's our main website https://www.citizenspring.org/ and the public lab research note (+comments) has a little more info for folks that have an appetite for citizen science nitty gritties https://publiclab.org/notes/smmontgom/09-08-2018/crowdsourcing-lead-testing-in-nyc-parks-and-playgrounds
Cheers, Sean
