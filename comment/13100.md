In a set, the beta program has people to post the "sets" in a research note. I smoothed the individual scans and compiled them as a set and posted them.

Looks like when you smooth a sample it doesn't save that way. Seems unnecessary for the beta testers to smooth the samples since they don't post the individual scans, and the smoothed version doesn't carry over to the set.
