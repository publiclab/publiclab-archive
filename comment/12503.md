This looks interesting!

From a simple spectrometer like the PublicLab spectrometer I would expect the intensity results to be lower than from a professional spectrometer; but the shapes of the graphs are what I think are interesting.
I do not know how to smooth the graphs from your PublicLab spectrometer. Perhaps Jeff at PublicLab can help with the smotthing.
