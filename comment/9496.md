Wow the photos are amazing. Was there a reason you mostly used the green? A blue laser will excite a broader range of colors, since light can only excite colors at wavelengths longer than itself. 

Your feedback on the alignment of the slit with the laser is really good. We're thinking of swapping in UV LEDs instead of a laser... what do you think?
