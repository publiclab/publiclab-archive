I just wanted to share my feedback here as well:

> Sushmitaâ€™s work ranged from database optimization to UI changes, and culminated in a deep dive project around data visualization with Cytoscape, where both kinds of expertise were needed. Sushmitaâ€™s ability to optimize and understand database complexity and to bridge that knowledge with a strong understanding of front-end JavaScript usability meant that Sushmitaâ€™s work was able to envision and bring to life powerful new features which draw upon large quantities of data, yet remain easy to navigate, understand, and put to use. Sushmita came into this project with an openness to cooperation and communication which really set up the project for success, and we have been happy and honored to have Sushmita leading this work for the summer.
