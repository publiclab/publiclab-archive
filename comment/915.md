Thanks, matthew - it does seem like Rhus could be adapted. The main features I've heard need for are:

* ability to click on a map and leave a text comment on the web (pretty easy)
* ability to record audio narration while panning around a map (i.e. 2 people might have an interview or "map storytelling" at a laptop; this is what we could easily try with a screencast posted to YouTube)
* ability to view a map, and see text or audio or video annotations people have left from the above interfaces, to learn more about why a map was made, what it depicts, and to invite people to ask questions and develop testable theories about what's shown. 
* maybe a way to "play" a series of annotations during an audio timeline
