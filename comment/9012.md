Thanks for the link. For my ghost hunting, I have been buying [PowerShot A590s for $20-$40](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_sacat=0&_from=R40&_nkw=canon+a+590), plus a [$5 filter tube that snaps on](http://www.dinodirect.com/52mm-lens-and-filter-adaptor-tube-for-canon-a570-is-b52-black.html), plus [an $8 IR filter](http://www.ebay.com/itm/52mm-52-mm-IR-850-nm-850nm-Infrared-Infra-Red-Filter-/380777452002?ssPageName=ADME:L:OC:US:3160). The A590 is a bit of a pain to convert, but results are pretty good. Here is a shot with that setup from today. There is one ghost turtle on the rock in the pond.
