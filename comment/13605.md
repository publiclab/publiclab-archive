The lamp pipe looks very close to an ideal solution, but... [lead is added to brass to make it more machinable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass#Lead_content).  If the brass isn't certified for use in Californian plumbing, its probably 1-3% lead with high lead motility in electrical grounding and water contact uses.  Both outcomes are likely in a long-term underwater or underground sensor installation. 

I was hoping that RoHS certified lamp components for the EU might be lead free. but copper alloys have an [exception under RoHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substances_Directive#Restriction_exemptions).

I think this same lead problem applies to the presta valves as well. 

I've only seen light steel as a replacement for brass in lamp pipe. I haven't seen stainless steel or other alternative non-corrosive material.  Light steel seems like a bad option because it corrodes readily, but painted steel has a good track record in marine uses.  I'd rather use a completely non-toxic material like light steel and coat it in a tough enamel paint, like nail polish.
