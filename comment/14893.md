Are you going to make me stand under a KAPtery rig with a Canon EOS M on it while you shake test it until it fails? Then you stand under a wooden dowel holding a Mobius ActionCam while I whack you in the head with it until it breaks.

All seriousness aside, I agree that the weak link is the human who puts the rig together. Structure can be compromised by poor drilling or failure to tighten the clamps. Safety might depend on clear instructions more than anything else.
