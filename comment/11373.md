Hi Jack, Two quick thoughts: (1) Have you degassed your sulfuric acid too?  For whatever reason, in my experience, H2SO4 takes longer to degas than a lot of other aqueous mixtures.  (2) Rather than drawing air via the aquarium pump, could you put it in line with a nitrogen tank to keep an inert atmosphere in that step?
