Just to clarify, the four points x1,x2,x3,x4 are the four points of the "aerial image" that is overlay, specifically in cartagen it is the pixel coordinates that we are using and not actual lat/long. So my work is mostly based on using pixel coordinates, so conversion from lat/long to pixels is done as required.
