Light is transmitted but it is diffusely scattered past a certain depth, which seems to be  ~7mm. The minimum thickness increases with the size of the target. A 15mm wide target could be 1.6mm thick whereas a 30mm wide target should be closer to 3.2mm thick. I have a 2mm thick teflon sheet that I found to be too thin to lay directly on the ground because absorption features of soil/vegetation seeped through. So, if you have a thin sheet (i.e. 1.6mm-3.2mm) you should elevate it so that there is a large air interface between the ground and the teflon. The teflon sheets for sale on Amazon don't seem to be as high quality as the stuff you can get from http://www.mcmaster.com/#sheets-%28made-with-teflon-ptfe%29/=pjtydw
