[@jywarren](/profile/jywarren) [@stevie](/profile/stevie) Updated the proposal with the external data that would be required and the location of each of the sample conversations. I would definitely love to move the interactions to multiple places closer to the actual work (eg: Questions and Github comments), but I think that chat is a more expressive and dynamic medium and it would be much easier to tinker with it (in the earlier phases of the bot atleast). Therefore, I would second [@stevie](/profile/stevie) and say that we should start out with the chatroom interface and add more interfaces later when the functionalities are better tested and more polished to avoid spamming both the Github repo and Publiclab website itself. (It is super easy to make a test chatroom and save everyone from the mess I would probably make while testing new features, and then push the more polished versions to the original chatroom + the github repo + the website)
