I think it might be possible to work on a simple calibration process that could be used to get decent NDVI values. I don't think there is much a user can modify with these cameras regarding settings and if that's the case we could come up with a formula tuned for the Mobius Action Cam. 

In the next couple weeks I hope to break out my cameras again to pick up calibration tests where I left off last year and would be happy to work with the Action Cam if someone has one they can send me for a week or two.
