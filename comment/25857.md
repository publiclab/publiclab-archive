HI. Can you give some details about the homemade radiation shield ?
Two plastic cans. One surrounded with aluminium paper and the other inside with holes. I can see on the pics, a funnel, and sensor datalogger inside.
Is it possible a brief explanation of these parts and the purpose?
thanks in adavance
