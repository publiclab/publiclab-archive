Hi, Matej - it also looks like some of your spectra are not calibrated, or perhaps not properly? I'm seeing some not aligned. 

But all of them seem suitable for calibration, as Ethan points out -- because the [calibration described here](/wiki/spectral-workbench-calibration) uses the 436nm and 543nm lines as references, and all of your spectra seem to show those (although Ethan is right, some are obscured by the smoothing you've applied).
