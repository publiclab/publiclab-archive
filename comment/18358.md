Limit of detection is dependent on instrument and method used. Desktop spectrometer works only with visible light, so for detection of substance you need selective reaction with another substance  that makes colour. Try searching: spectrophotometric determination of mercury. Common problems are big limit of detection, rare and expensive chemicals, influence of other substances. There are some interesting method using chemically modified carbon nanotubes...
