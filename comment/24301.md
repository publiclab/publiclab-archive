 Check the "baby legs" projects on microparticles. It will give some background.
My own experience was in medical plastics industry.  We routinely used FTIR, and variations, to ID plastics.  For example, we would use microscope FTIR, a variety of ATR methods, and all kinds of different preps( solvent cast, pyrolysis, hot press film, etc.).   Usually, this will ID the plastic, but occasionally we would have to rely on GPC, HPLC, EDXRF, or GC/MS.  The other methods would help identify fillers and antioxidants, as well.
