Hi natalie- it looks like the focus is a bit off... You actually don't have to remove the lens or anything to test this, you can just tape some red filter in front of the lens. 

Do you think you could photograph some live and dead plant material, like dead leaves and live leaves? The tree is just a bit blurry to infer much. 

Actually if you took the same photo with red and blue filters and also a regular photo that'd allow us to compare more thoroughly. Is that possible?
