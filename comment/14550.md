We'd have a lot more to work with if we knew which pixels were originally red vs green vs blue, and we could probably make more intelligent decisions about how to use each color channel. That said, I think [@stoft](/profile/stoft) is right and we could do some more with weighted formulas... pretty easy to do with the `transform` operation: https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectral-workbench-operations#transform (which works similarly to [Infragrammar](https://publiclab.org/wiki/infragrammar), actually)
