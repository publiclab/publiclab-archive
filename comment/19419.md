I tried CoolTerm and never got it to work. I tried for only a half hour, so my failure is not so surprising. If you have a working data logger (e.g., Mini Pearl, Nano Logger, or Riffle), CoolTerm does not necessarily provide any ease of use benefits. It's easy to set you up with a sketch which will log data onto the microSD card of an Arduino data logger. You already have a sketch which will test the operation of the sensor.

So you need a data logger and the cable to plug into the sensor (which you have to build). You also want an AC/DC converter (phone charger) and cable (mini USB or micro USB [Riffle]) to power the data logger from mains power. A Mini Pearl Logger needs an FTDI (UART) adapter. 

You will also need a few hours to tinker with the sensor and logger to get everything to work. Systems like this based on Arduino generally don't work the first time you turn them on.
