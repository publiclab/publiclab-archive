what would make a suitable pole and bracket for a DSLR (D610 with a 28-105mm zoom or an old Nikkor 35mm PC AI lens in my case): 
so 850 g + 455 g = 1305 g or 1.3 kg

I'd rather spend a bit more on the pole than buy a point and shoot I think. I have some point and shoots on the other side of the country I don't want another one but have an event coming up I'd like a pole for.
