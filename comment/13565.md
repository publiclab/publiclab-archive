Another update with the tuck-in flaps, slits, and the USB hole and the indexing hole for the potentiometer (although that may be premature). The design of the stack is going to be changed a lot, and the cuvette moved up against the window. The rest of the stuff above is resolved, and we need to do the electronics now, which [@cbreuer](/profile/cbreuer) has started to tackle.

Other than that, we're looking good; you can see the design also at https://publiclab.org/notes/cbreuer/02-06-2016/oil-testing-kit-initial-electronics
