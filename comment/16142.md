We just fired up a new collaborative project, and some of the academics from the other university suggested that our blog was something of a spaghetti monster, and that they had a hard time navigating through it all. So I whipped up a short summary page which summarizes all the latest build instructions:

[☀ How to Build an Arduino Data Logger ☀](https://edwardmallon.wordpress.com/how-to-build-an-arduino-data-logger/)

I've also posted a short video clip from one of our recent deployments on the  
[Year in review post](https://edwardmallon.wordpress.com/2017/01/07/the-2016-cave-pearl-project-year-in-review/) which might be of interest to others here working on underwater projects. It's worth noting that since the beginning of the project, we've accumulated more than 700 months of operational time with these little guys, and about half of that is in underwater. We have only had one housing failure, and that was from using bad epoxy.

Cheers!
