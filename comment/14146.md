I am so glad that you asked that question! I use 2 types of cuvettes, 1) Quartz - they have neutral UV absorption, so it passes right on through without any artifacts or problems.

2) I also use  semi-micro UV-transparent disposable Cuvettes, which are made of a plastic material that can be used with most polar solvents, very handy.

I have created my own "blanks" that I use to zero out the spectrometer, kind of a round about way of doing it, but it works, I usually subtract my reference, which usually is the solvent and then subtract the blank from that and it cleans up the signal pretty nicely.
