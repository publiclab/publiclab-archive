Hi [@read_holman](/profile/read_holman), I may have already shared this with you, but these are results we got with strips from Silver Lake Research (which is the OEM for WaterSafe and I believe for every other brand of 15ppb colorimetric lead test strip on the market) https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tWOEIZ0yhNs9g3sK5bJtTwx7ldODiI5RVTMbwwwxxHw/edit?usp=sharing
Unfortunately using a combination of atomic absorption spectroscopy, accurately lead-spiked tap water, and computer vision, our conclusion was that the strip to strip measurement variability was too high for us to use with https://www.citizenspring.org/. If one could use many strips on a single water sample and average the results, it might be improved sufficiently for some purposes, but it also becomes a more intensive and costly process (notably you would avoid a lab delay). This work isn't yet peer reviewed, but it does use rigorous scientific methods and was shown at the annual AWWA conference in 2017. There was a EPA funded SBIR grant in 2016 that was soliciting lead tests that were faster and more reliable, so that could be a thread to look at for updated solutions to the problem https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-05/documents/sbir_fact_sheet_2016.pdf 
Let us know if you find anything... I'd be super interested!
Cheers, Sean
