[@warren](/profile/warren):They would be low-noise green if you average them.   ;-)

[@stoft](/profile/stoft): BTW, I noticed that curves that were averaged over two or more channels look more rectanglish ("average" and "green"), whereas the single non-averaged curves ("red" and "blue")  look more "rounded" - so this, too, suggests that you are right about two green channels having been averaged here.
