Hi, I also have  exams Tuesday and will not be able to attend.   Happy to give a brief update:
--Attending high school in Virginia.   I live close to Washington DC!
--My project's goal is to build better software tools for different public lab science projects.   Right now I am trying to determine how to optimize camera settings, in the future I hope to work with computer vision tools to make measurements.
--My project may be different from the other GSOC projects in that it uses a raspberry pi computer connected to different types of optical measuring equipment.   The applications include a microscope, false color infrared imaging and spectroscopy.  One of the challenges is to get both the optical hardware and processing software to work together. 
-I hope to post  a new note soon with results of some NOIR (near infrared) camera observations.
