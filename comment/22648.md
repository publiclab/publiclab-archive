We did the [metal flame test demo](https://publiclab.org/notes/kgradow1/10-19-2015/pyrotechnics-101-flame-testing-metal-salts) last year using the PLOTS spectrometer.  I *thought* we had tested aluminum, but it doesn't look like we photographed it for the write-up.  My memory is that it glows red and starts to melt.   

Flame tests are typically looking for emission spectrum, which you would look for with a spectrometer and which are temperature independent. Aluminum has very faint spectral lines, so you probably wouldn't be able to see it with a spectrometer  (we looked but didn't see anything).  You will be able to see blackbody ("red" hot, "white" hot, "blue" hot) depending on temperature.  For instance, a magnesium strip burns bright white but steel wool burns red -- that's because magnesium burns hotter.   

Here's a [video of aluminum burning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M0sjPg_ii0), which should give you an idea of what to look for.
