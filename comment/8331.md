Great progress Pat.  The Wratten 25 photos are really sharp. They should allow very good NDVI images. Also, nice car.

The blemish looks a lot like lens flare. It is weird lens flare, so it is probably being influenced by the new internal filter. I have never noticed that type of lens flare with my converted cameras. It should not be a problem with mapping photos, and an improvised lens hood might eliminate the problem. My to do list includes designing a lens hood to 3D print for protecting the lens from impact and direct sun.
