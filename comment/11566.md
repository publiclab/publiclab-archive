One of my favorite Public Lab memories is when [@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) and I did a balloon mapping demo at Swamp Stomp, and annual educational field day for Louisiana public school students. The kids were SO EXCITED. Every 20 minutes we'd get a new group of 20-40 students, and they had so many questions about what we were doing with our big red balloon, and everyone wanted a chance to fly it. It was great to interact with them and show them photos we'd taken throughout the day, and the final paper maps from the oil spill. It was also hilarious watching them chase the balloon around and pull funny faces at it. For me, our time at Swamp Stomp really highlighted the emphasis we put on asking questions and having a sense of adventure!
