This would fit in well with the Commotion Wireless project (https://commotionwireless.net/) which is based on OpenWRT and includes an App Portal.  We've been thinking about setting up a Commotion Mesh for the school and local town offices while setting up dedicated application portals for things like environmental monitoring and vehicle tracking.  The Commotion team has even set up a few networks to run off of solar power so they can be used for back-up communications in an emergency.
