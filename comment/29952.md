Hi [@warren](/profile/warren)! Yes, 0.1-1 g/L is a useful range at least in rivers in this part of the world, in fact for [this river test](https://publiclab.org/notes/alejobonifacio/04-07-2022/using-coqui-in-a-the-suquia-river-for-conductivity-measurements) it worked well. I still have to try the configuration of resistors and capacitors suggested by [@donblair](/profile/donblair)
