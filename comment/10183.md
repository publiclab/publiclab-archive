Having an inexpensive mobile monitor would be wonderful.  In fact, having an inexpensive stationary monitor would be wonderful. But one needs credible evidence that they are doing what is expected. Accuracy, precision, and calibration must be attended to in comparison to a reference monitor. The original Dust Duino description questions the ability to monitor at time intervals less than an hour.  That would make mobile monitoring  problematic. Has any work been done to characterize these instruments?
