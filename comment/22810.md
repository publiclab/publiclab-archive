Maybe.  It depends on the chromophores present, the assay method used, and a bunch of other factors.  And that's before you talk about the instrument.

Refractometers are usually used to measure sugar ( often present in the % range).
If you nutrients fall in this range, a refractometer is an option.  

It's not well known, but blood analyzers were basically single beam spectrometers, but with lots of bells and whistles added. Heck, maybe some still are.
