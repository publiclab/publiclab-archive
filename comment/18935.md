Hi, folks! One thing I wanted to suggest was also including an outreach plan in your proposals -- it doesn't need to be too long, but just some ideas for how you might welcome newcomers in to helping you do your projects! 

Many of you have already done this kind of thing, and can help each other out with how to be friendly to newcomers, but also how to break off small pieces of your work and encourage others to take them up and become part of the team. I hope each fellow this summer will be able to engage a few other people to pitch in on their projects. 

You can read a bit about this at [#software-outreach](/tag/software-outreach) -- thanks!
