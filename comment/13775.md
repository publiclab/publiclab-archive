Hi [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) :)  

I'd never really testing it very thoroughly, and I haven't done sufficient background research to know if the 555 approach I was using would be particularly robust in the field.  Could be a fun project for folks to look into with us -- if it works well enough for a someone's particular use case, it'd be a pretty inexpensive way of getting water depth ...
