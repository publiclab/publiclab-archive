The topic is kind of overwhelming when you think of all the possibilities but maybe one model would be to start compiling how different METHODS were used successfully and which instruments/tools were utilized. 

There could be various qualitative scales for accuracy, portability, response time, and even difficulty level.  I think a method/application based score is more appropriate since  instruments/tools can be used in multiple ways.  For example, the formaldehyde test kit is a compilation of components and the accuracy will vary depending on your tube manufacturer, flow meter, and multitude of conditions, like sample flow and volume.  If it were in a database format (or even wiki linked) a user could also cross reference and see all the methods in which any one tool is utilized.

Some elements to consider reporting:

* Method Name
* Equipment used (multiple pick lists for cross reference)
* Media (pick list for cross reference: air, water, soil, etc.)
* Accuracy: Scale of 1 (ball park figure) to 10 (best known method)
* Response time: Scale of 1 (lab analysis required) to 10 (<1 sec frequency)
* Level of difficulty: Scale of 1 (turn on and use) to 10 (elaborate setup)
* Portability: Scale of 1 (only with a forklift) to 10 (carry in your pocket)
* Project citations: e.g. published paper, project, or "lab test by [name]"
* And then you could be more specific in a narrative format, like "Achieved 5% of range accuracy..."

As for a process to create, a "product review" format might be appropriate to build content quickest and then an average of multiple opinions are initially reported but a user could still read individual opinions.

Newer instruments would fit into this model too.  Like if there was a new PM monitoring device just developed and there was no field experiences yet, then someone could do a lab test and use those results to assess the instrument.
