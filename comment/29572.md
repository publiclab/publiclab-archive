That's very cool. If the summit you're referring to at Wiley's was a mountain justice camp then I was totally there.

I actually just shot a video today of the Edwight permit/Shumate slurry dam which is indeed the area that y'all mapped. Here it is - https://publiclab.org/notes/junior_walk1337/01-06-2022/edwight-shumate-1-6-22

I'm honestly pretty conservative about what all I do with the drone, as I've only got one, they're fairly expensive, and I destroyed one before when I was still learning how they work. That said, the idea probably would work, but there are regulations around how high you're really allowed to go with them.

Thank you! I appreciate that you've done some work around the issue as well!
