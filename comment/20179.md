####"People who use these tools do not need to understand research protocols or statistics in order to create scientifically-valid arguments."

I am concerned that this goal might be rather difficult to achieve. I cannot think of an example of a tool which would allow someone to make valid scientific arguments without first understanding what scientists do and how those tasks allow them to create new knowledge. This project also seems to encourage the presentation of a scientific argument without having the background to understand why it is a valid argument and therefore without the ability to defend the argument. This has the potential to be dangerously counterproductive.
