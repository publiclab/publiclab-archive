In the past, this company was using PVC ( polyvinylchloride).  If this is still being used, the most major issue from  PVC degradation is HCl (hydrochloric acid).  It is easily produced by excessive thermal degradation.  

There are many other chemicals that could be produced, depending on the additives in the PVC.  

Other plastics produce other chemicals.  Can the other plastics be identified?
