I think NDVI videos have the potential to be effective instructional vehicles and possibly important scientific records. The Kickstarter Infragram cameras will probably all be webcams and capable of capturing video, so many of the backers might find uses for NDVI (or NRG, NBG or NIR) video. The web app that Don and Craig are working on might have some of these capabilities, but an offline version might be more robust for higher resolution, longer clips, more options, multiple color tables, etc.
