I presume you will use a chain to connect this to a weight.
Does this design have enough buoyancy to carry the chain wieght?
The PVC design looks good, keep the price down.

Out of safety concern. 
Where are you going to put this.
If it will be put where other people can reach it. It needs to be bigger and a bright color. It need to be visible.
You do not want to go over it with a boat and mess up your propeller with a couple of meter of chain.
Same issue for night time. You may need to put a flashing light on top of it so it is visible.
