Yes, I guess I just kind of assumed that a 2x4 piece of treated wood would be less likely to stand out ( I wrote a fictional name on the post,too...."property of.... with MY own cell phone # on it to give it the appearance of a simple deer hunter's trail-cam in the event that it was discovered, also thinking that this would deter theft). The green fence post's flat face made it easy to attach the trail-cam using the zip-ties AFTER driving the post into the ground. It "works"!
