After receivingg tens of thousands of complaint letters, the Bayou Bridge Pipeline was modified to avoid 160 acres of wetlands, mostly wetland forest, and about 8 lakes, although many other complaints, filed by Basinkeeper to the Army Corps, have been mostly ignored, although we know the Corps has been forcing them to clean up some of the problems, because they are still out in the Basin constructing the pipeline. The Maurepas Pipeline received over 280 complaints by Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, and one major complaint from Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, and they were mandated to correct these blockages to the flow of water. HealthyGulf and Basinkeeper complained about illegal logging in Brown Bayou in 2018, and the unmarked logging trucks have not returned. St James Parish residents filed 9 complaints against odors and Mosaic before LDEQ inspected the facility--hopefully leading to fixes.
