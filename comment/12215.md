[@ajawitz](/profile/ajawitz) I'm not sure if you have seen the (lengthy) discussion on Markdown in various places, but I can link to at least one part of the longer conversation: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/151

Very likely we'll be putting a user interface that users can use without knowing or caring how the actual markup text looks. Buttons and that, like word processors that most users are already familiar with. In the backend, we will likely continue storing the markup information as Markdown, which would still support exporting markdown for various other uses. The difference is whether the user must use the markdown directly or use pretty buttons and pretty rendering which hides the Markdown.

There might be a "raw" button that lets advanced users edit the markdown directly if they feel comfortable with it.

I think that's a suitable summary of the current discussion.
