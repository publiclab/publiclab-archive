Unfortunately the cameras had been giving us a lot of trouble, and have not yet been deployed. The good news is that I was able to figure out how to use the motion sensor on both cameras, and I will be deploying them this coming Friday. The team will be deploying more equipment on the roof, including a dichotomous sampler!
