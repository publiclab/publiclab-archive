> 1. when I opened all the Images /videos post mapping, the Date sequence for each file is not the same as the current Date/Time Zone. It showed me 2018.10.10 for the images or videos.

I believe this is because the Raspberry Pi, without an onboard battery or external internet connection, just doesn't have a way to record the date. Perhaps we could think of an easy way to set the date in the start menu of [#pi-builder](/tag/pi-builder)?
