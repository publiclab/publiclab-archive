 Just noting for [@rexagod](/profile/rexagod), [@sashadev-sky](/profile/sashadev-sky), [@stefannibrasil](/profile/stefannibrasil) re: MapKnitter UI input! Thanks [@silentsairam](/profile/silentsairam)!

> 1. when I opened all the Images /videos post mapping, the Date sequence for each file is not the same as the current Date/Time Zone. It showed me 2018.10.10 for the images or videos.

I believe this is because the Raspberry Pi, without an onboard battery or external internet connection, just doesn't have a way to record the date. Perhaps we could think of an easy way to set the date in the start menu of [#pi-builder](/tag/pi-builder)?
