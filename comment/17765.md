Thanks so much, Jeff! I think we know that there are many many pain points. Here we have collected some of them https://github.com/publiclab/SmART-Form/issues/8 and so I think [#2](/n/2) is what we are looking for--understanding how the UI would work ideally as I worry that if we fix pain point by pain point we might end up with a total redesign but through a much longer process.  We are working on putting in a tour for first timers, that should be done by monday-ish :)
