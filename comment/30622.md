Today we learned about environmental population of specie who were endangered but now reproduce rapidly to last for the next 100 years. The species in the image are gulf killifish, sheepshead minnows, oyster killifish, diamond killifish, brown shrimp, and white shrimp. Restoring Louisiana lost coast, marsh land and barrier island can cause an ecological succession. The fresh water from the river with sediments will be flush out to the gulf to restore the barrier island. This can cause an allogenic succession where saltwater fish will be replaced with freshwater fish species. The coastal marsh restoration plan causes environmental succession this is an attempt at allogenic succession which is a new term that we have recently learned which is the succession of an ecosystem by the succession of the environment abiotic factors. The barrier island playâ€™s a crucial role for the safety of Louisiana from hurricanes but restoring these barrier islands can have a negative impact on the fishing industries.
