Muki's recent post on the European Citizen Science Association workshop explores web tools for collaborative science writing, references Public Lab's research notes, and attempts listing the roles available to people in a collaborative writing project: "authoring text, fact checking, reference checking, chart and graph design, map design, translation, checking for comprehension, proofreading, reviewing, checking the statistics for mistakes and possibly more." The workshop came up with roles for science communicators and contemplated stages of collaboration -- a development-mode of collaboration and a final document prep mode.

Overleaf is a proprietary interface based on [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) that has added realtime collaboration, document templates, and pop-up help that's specific to specific document sections. Examples of document templates include: "project / lab report" "academic journal" "bibliography".
