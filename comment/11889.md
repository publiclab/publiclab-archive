hmmm.... the level of the rotameter goes and stays at .3L/m when I hold it down to the table at a level point.  the vibration of the pump and levelness seem very crucial to an accurate reading.  in terms of a DIY kit, I'm inclined to think that the rotameter is more likely to introduce calibration issues.
