Wow i wasn't familiar with PID sensors. I skimmed the Wikiepedia page here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoionization_detector

And also found this pretty readable post about limitations or possible issues with them: https://www.levitt-safety.com/blog/the-problem-with-pids/

Do we know how much they cost? I'm guessing a lot? Google Shopping suggests maybe $500-5000: https://www.google.com/search?tbm=shop&q=pid+sensor+gas

As to detection, Wikipedia says down to parts per billion? `from sub parts per billion to 10 000 parts per million (ppm)` 

The one in the article above was $3000-4000 -- https://www.google.com/search?tbm=shop&q=tiger+voc#spd=857929050906658907

It says it is sensitive down to 1 part per billion: `A robust VOC detector Tiger provides a dynamic detection range of 0 to 20,000 parts per million (ppm) with a minimum sensitivity of 0.001ppm (1 ppb), offering the widest measurement range of any other VOC detector on the market. `

But they seem to have a pretty tough calibration procedure involving some kind of calibration machine. 

I did see some available for rent, so maybe they'd come precalibrated?
