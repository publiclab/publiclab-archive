HAH!  We can absolutely *not* confirm the statement in that sentence.  That assessment (guess) was made late at night, after much whiskey.  If you've been clipping it off and things have been working fine, then our assessment is likely wrong :)  In fact, I shall revise the post to include a more tentative statement about the nature of that dangling bit.

Thanks so much re: the developed film!  I'll rummage about here to see if I can find any (was also thinking I might ask CVS in case they discard it regularly and wouldn't mind giving some to me) -- but if I somehow can't find any, and it's easy to mail it along, then that'd be cool!
