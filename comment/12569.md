Hi All,
Tampons shouldn't contain brighteners--we tested several different types, from the "all natural and organic" types, to plain old Tampax, to fancy "pearl" and pocket ones, and none had brighteners, irrespective of material type. 
Cotton balls probably do have brighteners, as they are present in most fabrics/cottons to make them appear whiter.  
Thing is, tampons are cheap and ubiquitous, and frankly have  a handy string to tie them to things to dip them in the water--they work well, so I don't think cotton balls would be an improvement, anyway. 
Also, as far as what detergents have brighteners--certainly do the testing, it is pretty fascinating, and labeling as "natural" or "free" doesn't necessarily mean that they're free of brighteners.  
Still trying to find a time to field test this technique...
