1- Fat soluble, toxic pollutants can adsorb to microplastics. When these plastics are consumed, toxic pollutants can accrue in fat and become biomagnified

2- The Gulf of Mexico is critically impaired due to microplastic.

3- The volume of microplastics directly correlates to distance of the river.
