 NREL's SAM has access to NREL AWS Truepower files, you may be able to access and incorporate some of that data if you're looking to measure wind energy potential. There is also similar information on solar potential if that's a direction you're thinking of going in. 

I did a little bit of digging, [this dataset](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/eastern-wind-data.html) looks pretty out of date, but I'm sure there's more available somewhere on NREL's site.
