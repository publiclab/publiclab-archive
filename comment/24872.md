> Once plastics have been in the water for a while, they've both attracted new industrial chemicals (like the flame retardants, pesticides, heavy metals, mentioned in the video) and leeched out some of their original chemicals. This usually makes them a challenge to recycle if they're large enough. If they're microplastics then it's nearly impossible since their polymer types can only be identified by a spectrometer... rather pricey, even for labs. In our lab, we tend to keep what we collect to compare them between areas and over time, so we build up an archive. We also give some of those samples away to schools, environmental NGOs and others who use them for education. Short of that, throwing them in a landfill is the only other option. This is why we try to use monitoring to look up the pipe to industry and where the plastics are coming from, rather than focusing on the end of pipe-- there's no good end of pipe option!
