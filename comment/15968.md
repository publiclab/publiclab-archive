Hi, great discussion. Probably the best thing here would be for us to build our own custom board including a high speed interface for capturing streams. I'll be looking for the new MLX90640 this fall (32x24) in which case we could build an 8x8 sensor array (128x96) and have something like the Lepton Camera from FLIR albeit double the resolution and half the price.
