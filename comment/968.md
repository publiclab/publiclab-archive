I am interested in repeating this H2S measuring procedure with some modifications.  Hydrothermal vents have been suggested as point sources, but I've noticed that this experiment takes place in a marsh.  I'm assuming from my reading that this experiment is measuring H2S produced by anaerobic degradation of plant material by bacteria.  What is a good set of criteria for identifying a wetland that will produce high amounts of H2S?   Can you point me to any papers on this subject?  I live in the San Francisco bay area, so there may be many opportunities if brackish marshes can exhibit this behavior.
