In my opinion, the reasons you chose those two locations we're very 
important reasons. The location in the kitchen is a good place to put 
the air quality egg because the kitchen is where you cook and eat and 
so it is important to know what kind of air your food is around and what
you breath. Also, placing the air quality egg in your room is also a 
smart place because that is where your mostly at, you sleep there 
8 hours or more a day. What I would have done differently is place the
egg in the living room like Stephanie said because of the traffic that 
goes on daily. However, the air quality egg locations we're clever 
places to locate the eggs.
