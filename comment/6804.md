I guess the WB introduces a big unknown about the relative *amounts* of NIR vs visible light. One way the NIR and VIS might mix in blue is that perhaps the visible light is far stronger than the NIR in that range, and the channel adjusts (i.e. white balances) to a dynamic range which shows mostly visible light and little NIR. But potentially the sensitivity of the red channel is unaffected under that white balance setting.

Do you think this shows promise for the use of cameras which leak blue in the IR?
