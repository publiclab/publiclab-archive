Hey, [@justinmanley](/profile/justinmanley)! Thank you so much for looking at my proposal, and while I did have a glance at your comment a bit earlier, I was actually quite a bit occupied in a ton of college activities, and even though I could've written back to you just then, I really wanted to take by time to reply on this brilliant and insightful feedback of yours.

First off, I'd like to ensure the fact that (agreeing with [@warren](/profile/warren)) any functionality that we believe could be better implemented in a modularized fashion, will definitely get extracted out into it's own module, for eg., ORB stats will reside in one module, while ORB UI renderer that works on those stats in the other, etc., with our main aim of improving the testing functionality, an easier bisection to locate bugs, and obviously, enhanced reuse-ability in the future as well.

> Ideally, your code shouldn't need any special rendering code at all: if it outputs data in the format that Leaflet.DistortableImage can understand (e.g. image + the coordinates of the warped corners, in a common coordinate space), then you may be able to use Leaflet.DistortableImage to handle the rendering altogether.

Exactly! I suppose the rendering part, as suggested by [@warren](/profile/warren), could be completely done using the Leaflet APIs themselves, while ORB.js, or AS.js, would resort to a _headless approach_ and only _pass_ the useful statistical data into the UI space where I can utilize that data to perform general manipulations, as per the user's requirements.

> One thing I don't see covered in this proposal is how the uploaded images will be aligned to the base map once they been automatically stitched together.

That's probably due to the fact that I was initially unclear of the plans regarding the [EXIF functionality](https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/pull/169#issuecomment-486689262), but now since it's really close to getting merged, I believe that whenever AS will rubber-sheet and stitch to different images, with the assumption that those two images actually form a bigger overlay of the same area (thus close EXIF coordinates), aligning the larger image according to anyone of those two (based on their EXIF metadata) would automatically align to the other one too!

> Separately, I wonder about the performance of these computer vision operations in the browser. Do you have a sense of how computing keypoints / matches / homography perform in the browser? These operations are all extremely compute-intensive (especially on the GPU), and I have found that JS libraries for numerical computation are not always as robust or performant as their server-side counterparts (e.g. OpenCV). Have we considered the tradeoffs of doing these computations in the browser vs. on the server?

Okay so I profiled the ORB implementation in my demo above for ~7 minutes. Below are the results.

**GPU Evaluation: The overall site used negligible resources after the first minute. As is visible from the gif below too, the amount of GPU memory needed to process the website could easily be provided by older generation chipsets (~14mb, checkout the top-left corner of the gif below), let alone the newer graphic cards. Below that is the GPU memory usage, that was actually needed for a very short amount of time (~1 sec in the active span of 1 minute, checkout the "summary" tab).**

**Current Performance Bottlenecks: Most of our performance issues were caused by [JS scripting events (`Timer fired` and `Animation Frame Fired` to be precise)](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/performance-reference#scripting_events). Some improvements over such scripting practices can be made by using `requestAnimationFrame` instead of `setInterval` and `setTimeout`, which was the only reason that caused the red triangles to appear in my performance evaluation, meaning we should be good to go after these particular methods that implement the same are refactored.**

**The image below depicts the `Timer Fired` event (performance critical, notice the red triangle on the corner) that was fired using a `setTimeout` on `orb.js:26` which can be fixed easily by moving the `tick` and `demoapp` renders inside a `requestAnimationFrame` param.**

**The one above was easy, but it was the one below that took the prize (check the number of red triangles). Now I do want to bring it to your notice that as of now ORB does not take up that much resources, due to it's specificity, i.e., unlike OpenCV or any other library, it is (a) tailored for only and only this particular use and (b) will be greatly reduced in terms of events and complexities in the future for an even better performance. Now considering the current stable state of this module, the performance boost we'd be getting by removing all these red flags would be unbelievable, since the scripting processes would be reduced to near-null, which currently make up for the better part of the summary chart, and we just might be able to shift this to the client-side, thus reducing the load on our servers! But this would ultimately imply that we "cut" support for all browsers that do not support the `requestAnimationFrame` method, [which shouldn't cause any problems or reduction in the user count](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame#Browser_compatibility), whatsoever.**

I'd like to hear your thoughts and insight on any/all of this, and again, thank you so much for the kind words and energy, really appreciate it!
