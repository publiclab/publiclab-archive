Interestingly enough, I did just now find this $889 turf grass color meter which does, indeed, use NDVI!

http://www.specmeters.com/nutrient-management/chlorophyll-meters/ndvi/tcm500/

Unfortunately, for me it's a non-starter, because I can instead buy/make and deploy a bunch of wireless soil moisture sensors for that amount of money.  i.e. NDVI is only a win for me if it's inexpensive.

So, is there any hope for getting the $55 Public Labs NDVI Plant Health web cam to do the same?  If so, how to do it?

To sum up: if color can be measured by the public labs NDVI (as the above find suggests maybe it can), then we have a proxy for measuring turf water stress over time.  i.e. in principal, the objective should be achievable.

Can anyone here corroborate?  If it's an uphill battle or a fools errand, I'd rather save myself the effort and find an easier way to do the remote sensing, or possibly conclude it's too difficult or expensive and just skip it altogether.

I welcome any further advice/suggestions/recommendations.
