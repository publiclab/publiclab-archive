Chris,

I really don't know the actual time but assuming 800usec (nice for the math) to sleep and wake up it would be 800 / 8,000,000 or 0.01%  which seems fine to me. This is another of the functions we should instrument and evaluate. I suspect users would appreciate knowing the typical usable battery life with known loads such as the demo data logging sketch.

BTW, there is still some current drawn in sleep mode.
