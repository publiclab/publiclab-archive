This is awesome. I actually found this website because I recently moved into an apartment with new paint and new carpet, and the off gassing is intolerable. The smell has dissipated, but I can only assume that VOC's are still being released because my lungs hurt when ever I am there. I actually started thinking about bacteria to 'purify' the air because I wanted to make some sauerkraut. But I figured the kraut would would probably interact with what ever is in the air, and that it probably wouldn't be good to eat. I have been desperately searching for solutions, and I am pretty sure I will get no support from my landlords unless I had some sort of proof that my space is a toxic soup. Testing is expensive. So far I have acquired 11 house plants...which must not be enough. And I have been cutting up onions and setting out vinegar ( common suggestions from google). There has got to be a way to address this problem. Melissa, you said you used the EM to freshen the air?
