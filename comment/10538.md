I think that small commercial spectrometers typically use a collimating lens to get light coming through the slit parallel prior to going through the grating (Ben used this approach here: http://publiclab.org/notes/bhickman/08-27-2014/3d-printed-ccd-spectrometer-wheetrometer-3-0).  If you go to a 3d printed housing, then having a lens holder integrated into the design should be fairly easy and that might help cut down on the stray light without losing all your intensity.
