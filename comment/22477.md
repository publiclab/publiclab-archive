As Mathew and David pointed out, there aren't readily available low-cost techniques for distinguishing among potential sources of particulate matter. Many atmospheric chemists will use Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to discern likely sources, and this approach involves a variety of chemical analysis (generally non-metals, alkali, alkali earth, and transition metals; sometimes organic compounds too) and significant modeling of source inputs and atmospheric transformations. Interpreting the PCA results often involves meteorological back trajectories (which David noted) too. It's a powerful tool. 

For more accessible methods that could indicate some plausibility of a source of particulate matter, the upwind/downwind and receptor timing strategies David mentioned are key. Here is a wiki with more information about very basic study design for those different questions: [https://publiclab.org/wiki/general-environmental-monitoring-study-strategies](https://publiclab.org/wiki/general-environmental-monitoring-study-strategies). The sections of interest for this question are probably "influence of specific mine" and "influence of specific process."
