In order to measure particles in sand mine areas of  W. Wisconsin/ SE Minn., I noticed from a google/NASA map today that average wind speed in this area is 6-7 m/s, at 80 m. Reference:

As this is more than the 5m/s above, how difficult is it to compensate for higher windspeed?
[I have no idea whether average means mean, median or mode, but I'm guessing mean]
Does Tom Peters have a technique, seeing that he's working in windy Iowa?

also, I'm wondering about the design of the flat plate used for collection-the photo reminded me of some of the old techniques used to keep a candle burning in windy conditions. The most effective one I ever saw was one that surrounded the candle in a tin cylinder that had lots of small holes punched away from the candle. The candle got plenty of air, but couldn't be extinguished, even with fireplace bellows. The candle wasn't affected in the windiest conditions, and no dripping indicating drafts or uneven airflow. The question, of course is whether this would impede the particles that you want to get.
 I'm imagining a plate with the surface of a very fine grater. Memory says these were called the "? betty". Illustration below is the only one I could find.
This is a very long shot, I know. ( Trying to light a camp stove at high altitude in the wind above tree line when backpacking made me think of this a lot.)
