I want to know more! It seems like there are areas around the canoe which have similar appearance in the gray scale are these water chestnut areas too? Is the water chestnut the black areas in the gray scale image and there are just different densities of water chestnut? Very cool. Would love to hear more. Thanks for sharing. Is this the Warner Lake where the images are from:
