Hi all-
My update for this week, I have been trying to work with a stepper motor and hooking it up to a raspberry pi. I might also try using the arduino with it too to test it out. My current method of learning is through the web, I have found some sites that show how to attach the device to a breadboard and the code for it but still trying to find the best way to carry out this task. The aim is to find a code that will move my camera a certain distance and stop to take a picture while continuing on its path. Once I have the code mastered, once I am able to buy parts and get my prototype started I will already have some code to work with! Looking forward to learning more about coding!
