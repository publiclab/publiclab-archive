I'd suggest it is always good practice when testing to make use of original data, in the case of purple air that would mean the logged concentrations. Below is a graph using the recorded concentrations that I downloaded. There is certainly a drop in concentrations but it is not to zero. Sorry I don't understand how to put an image here.
