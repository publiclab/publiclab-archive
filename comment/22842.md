Hi [@JSummers](/profile/JSummers), We have checked the connections and they seem fine. I downloaded Energia. Tiva C card was selected on the board list, but we run into this error message : Energia: 1.6.10E18 (Windows 7), Carte : "LaunchPad (Tiva C) w/ tm4c123 (80MHz)"

C:\Users\herzog\Documents\Nancy-CNRS\Collaboration\Yusri Yusup USM\Wheestat\MicrocontrollerSourceCode\WheeStat6_c\WheeStat6_c.ino:19:101: fatal error: altSPI.h: No such file or directory

 [#include](/tag/include) <altSPI.h>           // alternative SPI library must be in "libraries" folder in sketchbook

                                                                                                  ^

compilation terminated.

exit status 1
Compialtion error for card LaunchPad (Tiva C) w/ tm4c123 (80MHz)

Where is the altSPI.h file? 

Thanks for your help!
