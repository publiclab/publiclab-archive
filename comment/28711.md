I think it's good to be cautious about timelines. My ideal is to put the most urgent issues first, unless that disturbs some important sequencing. For example, [@noi5e](/profile/noi5e) would perhaps have had an easier time doing a React project first, because it replaces a lot of code. But, we knew ahead of time that it would be the "riskiest" and most experimental -- and also least urgent -- part of the project. So we worked together to place it last, and did testing and bugfixing first, followed by a deeper structural rewrite. Finally, React happened last.

I like what you're saying about Cytoscape and i think your instinct is right to put it towards the end!
