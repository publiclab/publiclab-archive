US out of helium within a decade, according to the video? Yikes! Safe hydrogen generators for balloons, kites, UAS (drones) for our photomapping? Interesting. In Stewart Long's comments about Shannon Dosemagen's <a href="http://flic.kr/p/cYLsUL">photo of New Orleans Public Lab space</a>, he writes, "... If you have a big enough doorway you could leave balloons inflated... " 

I recall, in searching for helium recovery/recycle systems, seeing European advertising balloon folks describing their trailers for their big balloons and how  they top them off. Similar to the dirigible approach.
