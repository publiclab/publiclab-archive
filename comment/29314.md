Hi Ag8n, thanks for your question! we haven't tried SDR++ yet but we are intrigued. We've run into some issues with CubicSDR in the past so this could be another solution (we really need a cross platform, open source programme for the work we are trying to do). thanks for mentioning!

Also, would you like to participate in the open-weather 'nowcast' coming up on 31st October? If so feel free to get in touch over email (openweathercommunity@gmail.com).
