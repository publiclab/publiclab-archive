Thank you Juan,
yes, that would be possible, but it would be easiest to use the rectangle, the scale bar, as a north arrow. If you always point it north-south, with the code on the left (or right) consistently, it should work like that.
I could upload a pdf of say the first 30 codes in A3 format if anyone is interested.
