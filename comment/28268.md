THANK YOU!!! We just found out that the permit is up for review and comment. We are going to ask for an extension but we know we have 30 days. All of Chevron's public records were not available when recently asked to review them. We were told they were being copied/scanned for digital access. I have to find out where they are on this process. We may be able to get access online. 

I would love to workshop together. Please let me know what you have in mind and when works best for you and other. Please email at citizensbuyout@gmail.com.
