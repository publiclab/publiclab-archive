Prepping the DVD is a **HUGE** pain.  

Tried:
Xacto knives
Duct tape ( works but leaves residue )
Sticking it in the freezer
Super glue doesn't work.

The best bet is to split the DVD down the seam ( so that you'd end up with 2 DVD shaped pieces )  and hope that the metallic film stays attached to the top ( the side thats printed on).

The bottom side is what you want.

STILL. An ENORMOUS pain.
