Hi [@shubhangi_student_eee20](/profile/shubhangi_student_eee20) thank you for your proposal, it's excellent and detailed! I especially appreciate how you've used a responsive layout to really make a lot of space for things to fit without feeling crowded. The Help popup looks great, too, although i wonder what it will look like with a full table of questions in it. It might be good to test out or think about whether it's enough horizontal space. Maybe the Q&A should be a full sidebar, to make for more space? 

Also, it's a small thing but i think in the "editing" interface on Infragram, we can probably drop the footer, so it can go full height with no scrolling. That way some tools or items could be stuck to the bottom of the screen as well! Does that make sense?

Thank you!
