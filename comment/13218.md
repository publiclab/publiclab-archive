Hi Chris,
I am using the v3 Spectrometer kit, I have tried different light sources, the one i am currently using is a white LED, i have tried with an incandescent light also. 
the video is the help video on the website where instructions on how to subtract light sources are explained... at the moment I can capture spectra and save them but I have not been able to remove the backlight source from them.
thanks so much for your help!
