So, the time has come to get ready to move this from the bench to the real world.  

Thus far...

* Started with a new plated through-hole half size proto board which makes component mounting a lot easier.
* Switched to XBee Series 2 for communications.
* Switch to 3.6V, 1200mAh NiMh battery from standard 3.7V 700mAh battery
* Raspberry Pi Perl code now uses  Device::XBee::API to get data from XBee on Pro Trinket.
* Added hot glue to protect connections on some solder joints as the wires are 25Ga and prone to break.  Will order some PCB mountable RJ11 jacks and use phone plugs for connections later.
* Tested code on Pro Trinket - seems solid, reliable, and fast.
* Currently profiling Perl code on Raspberry Pi to ensure it is efficient.  Seems to work fine now that I have made a few mods.
* Am now using a USB to FTDI converter on the RPi instead of the GPIO pins.  I have found it to be much more reliable and stable.

Left to do...

* Need to add as MOSFET or Schottky diode between the charge controller and the Solar Panel to prevent back-feed when the panel is shaded or in the dark.
* Add a voltage regulator on the output of the charge controller, as it will output whatever is available, ~7V when the solar panel is in play, or 5V if plugged into USB, or 3.7 volts if sourcing the battery.  Not good.  need 3.3 to 3.7 volts consistently for Pro Trinket and XBees.
* Test range of XBees.  Should be able to get 300 feet line of sight out doors.  ~100 feet indoors.
* Add the light sensor to the Trinket, modify code to send that data to the RPi along with the rest, modify DB schema to store light sensor values.
* Build up the web interface for viewing data on the RPi.

This image show the RPi to the back of the post, the charge controller and 6V, 2 Watt solar panel to the left, and the protoboard to the right... all running at the time the photo was taken.

Overall setup (and my messy workbench).  The tipping bucket rain gauge is behind the pole.  There is a DS18B20 weather proof temp gauge just showing in front of the pole in front of the top bracket which hold the rain gage.  Testing/calibration of the sensors has been done and is reliable. (except the light sensor which has yet to be incorporated.

I think I will have this done by spring and be able to gather data for the summer, fall and winter of 2016 and beyond...
