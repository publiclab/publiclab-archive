 First, using a spectrometer in the visible range ,by itself, normally isn't possible.  You normally have to add chelating agents to make the metals visible and adjust the ph .  Chromium might be an exception to this, depending on the detection limits.  

There are standard methods for detecting metals in liquids.  Check with the epa for the specific method.  But they are rarely continuous.  Usually, they require sampling the water and adding reagents for testing.  Many also require moderately expensive equipment.
