following up on our discussion about trying to calibrate the pump without the flow meter-- could we calibrate the pump at our office, and then have it run on a timer?  that would probably make the test easier-- we could do automatic shutoff.  I think that makes the process even easier.

While regular wall switch timers are affordable, I can't find one with one-minute accuracy that isn't a wall plate-- so we'd have to wire our own electrical box, which I don't want to do. They're usually in 15 minute increments, which won't be precise enough:

I think the best interface is an analog dial. I have two darkroom timers here, and  [vintage timers are 10-40 bucks on ebay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=timeolite&_from=R40|R40&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR2.TRC1.A0.H0.Xtime-o-lite.TRS1&_nkw=time-o-lite&_sacat=0), but new timers are too expensive.  Dunno if we want to deal with the headache of sourcing a bunch of different things.
