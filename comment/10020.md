Hi [warren](/profile/warren) , I realized too that tab2 overlaps with another page, still looking at why this is so. I am also currently working on implementing the GPS/Compass indicator and the lat lon tags on the photo (might be due to wrong formatting of received values). Will update next how this is coming along.
Yes it is possible to use an Intent to open the SkyCamFolder while still inside the app, this will be available in my next code update.
