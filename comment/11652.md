[@danbeavers](/profile/danbeavers) hmm... the variability in the break and its effect on flow could be quantified with a more accurate flow meter.  I wonder how variable it would be-- they provide that little bauble of glass on the end to try to make it break in the same place. 

[@davidmack](/profile/davidmack) suggested the graduated cylinder method in the first comment of this note.

[@nshapiro](/profile/nshapiro) I wouldn't feel comfortable with a stepped, DIY bore to an air meter- I'd seriously doubt its accuracy.
On making the system tamper-proof- we could use a "time delay relay" which is a standard piece of automation/security/HVAC equipment ($8-25).  We could then set the timer before the pump leaves our office, and the user would just hit a push button to start the process.  Time delay relays generally reset the counter with every button press though-- so we'd probably want to get a two-channel relay and use the second relay for turning off the button as soon as the timer starts EDIT-- a quick search reveals there are also "self-locking" time-delay relays.   Someone would have to take the whole monitor apart to reset the pump timing.
