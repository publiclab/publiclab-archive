We were in an medical environment, usually class 100,000.  These instruments are different from the ones used by public lab, but based on the same principles.  Normally, the instruments would get about 10 minutes warm up time.  Then we would do a "sanity check".  We'd put a 0.25 micron air filter on the air input and see what the instrument read.  It should read zero.  If not, there was a calibration problem.  Now there are differences between the instruments we used and the instruments used here.  In the medical field, the instruments normally have pumps that pull the air through.  Also, calibration was required every six months to guarantee the particles were sized correctly.  This is not cheap.  Hope this helps answer the question.  Regards!
