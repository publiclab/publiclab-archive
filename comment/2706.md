That's a challenge if smartphone cameras are not very sensitive to low light.  More tests are called for, but I think the cheap diffraction grating film that I used transmitted about five times more light than the DVD-R.  So upgrading to a [$4.50 piece of grating film](http://www.amazon.com/Diffraction-Grating-Slides-Linear-1000-Line/dp/B0088AQFE4/) might be smart for smartphone spectrometer users. A [half square foot of it](http://www.amazon.com/Diffraction-Grating-sheet-Linear-Inches/dp/B007G0J1RU/) costs < $10.
