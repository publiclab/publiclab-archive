Mmmm, weird!
The one I lasercut is 23.5cm long, as it should. I just measured it. 

However, all the files I am looking now in inkscape (the ones I just downloaded from github and the files I modified and sent for print) are around 19cm long. I'll keep looking to see what I am missing.

If you can, try to open the file (https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/018/857/original/spec-cut-clean-plainF_archivo-final-corte.ai) they used for lasercut and see its lenght!
