Hi abaker. Currently I'm using a third order polynomial to calibrate the spectrometer. I simply take a spectrum of a fluorescent light and save the output, then I match up as many peaks as possible with [Wikipedia's fluorescent spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_lamp) and fit the pixel number to wavelength using Excel. The you can go into the wavelength_on_pda_element.csv file and update the wavelengths with the calibrated ones. I should also mention that when you save the data using the GUI, it saves two rows of data, the current run is the first row and the previous blank is the second.  Let me know if you need more help. I know the GUI still needs some work, so if you run into more bugs let me know.
