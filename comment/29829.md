In class today we watched a video called "Microplastic Ingestion By Humans and Fish". They told us about how fish have a lot of microplastics inside their stomachs mostly catfishes and many other "deep water" fishes that are in the oceans/lakes/rivers. People throw their trash into these waters and the fish eat it thinking that its food and eventually start getting sick because of all the microplastics that's in their stomachs.
