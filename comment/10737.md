Hi Patrick,

To do this in GIMP you will need to work with indexed images and upload a GIMP palette file (.gpl) which follows the Fastie colormap.

My advice would be up upload Chris' NDVI_VGYRM.lut file and then using a text editor, compare it to the .gpl file to see how you can convert the files from one format to another. Once you have loaded the new .gpl then you can try it on your mobius imagery.

Jeff
