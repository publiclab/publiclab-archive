There has never been a sulfide mine that has not produced terrible environmental damage and acid runoff.
My experience with mining companies in Wisconsin is that they routinely lie.
The Sierra Club has a lot of good info on sulfide mining. Brief quote here:
"1) No metallic sulfide mine has ever been demonstrated to operate in the long term without damaging the environment in the United States or Canada. In fact, metallic sulfide mines harm nearly all aspects of our environment â€” destroying our land, polluting our air, and poisoning our water. In fact, a study in 2012 found that, out of the 14 copper sulfide mines responsible for nearly all the copper production in the United States, every single one of them spilled toxic waste materials into the environment, and 92 percent failed to contain seepage.

Many metallic sulfide mines are open pit mines, meaning companies kill forests and vegetation by bulldozing expansive swaths of land, before digging large craters to excavate the minerals. In fact, more than 80 percent of copper operations in the United States use open pit mining. Because it involves clearing vast natural areas, it reduces biodiversity, contributes to deforestation, and devastates entire ecosystems."
