Tom, The Jobin Yvon tutorial describes reflection gratings, and I don't know enough to apply those rules to our transmission grating setups. The manual for the "Advanced Spectrometer" mentions that the scope for viewing the spectra should be focused at infinity. That spectrometer has a lens between the slit and the grating to collimate the light. Maybe if the light is collimated, then its like the image is infinitely far away, and focusing on infinity is required. My system does not have a collimating lens, but a long path length tends to collimate the light. Maybe that is why I can focus on the spectrum with my naked eye. But cameras do not form sharp images of spectra when focused at infinity. It's still inscrutable.

Dan, I think I need a diagram.
