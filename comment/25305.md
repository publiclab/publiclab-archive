Hi, 
-One option would be to use near infrared LED strip lights  similar to what was done here: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6Vz6sSnXhY&feature=youtu.be.  The Raspberry Pi can also control strip light timing(with an op amp or relay). 
- Most NIR  LED strips come in around 830-850 nm.   They  may have a slight red tail edge that is visible(if your eye is dark adapted).   You can purchase 910nm options which have no visible emissions but this is also getting near the edge of pi camera sensitivity.    So 910nm images will work, just  more grainy pictures than 850nm.
