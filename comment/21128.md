This is a great proposal, thanks!

I appreciate your attention to detail on things like redirects from old paths -- great thought!

for `Week 4: Select js chart library and add "No. of subscribers per tag" chart.` - I do wonder if this could get the project bogged down a bit, since there have been several chart lib changes and there might be a lot of refactoring. I am slightly in favor of leaving this until later in the project, and making due with simpler charts that are possible with the current libraries, until the relatively complex back-end work is more developed. But I could be persuaded! :-)

> Week 1 and 2: Create backend GET APIs for requesting JSON/CSV data for all graphs along with unit tests.

This sounds great, esp. the unit tests. I did want to ask if you thought the API (grape/swagger) was the right place to implement this -- i think it may be, just want to think through it! Would that make integration with, for example, GrimoireLab easier, because Grape/Swagger is so standardized? Does Grape/Swagger have standard ways to generate CSV? Do you prefer this to making additional formats available in the `stats_controller`, and why? This is an interesting point so I just wanted to dig into it a bit and hear your thoughts, thanks!

Your idea for a secondary read-only helper database (let's avoid the term slave [as other software projects have done, happily](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8x7akv/masterslave-terminology-was-removed-from-python-programming-language)) is pretty interesting -- do you have any links or resources related to doing this in Rails? Thanks!

I like all the thinking you're putting into optimization. I think actually a lot of optimization can come from what the UI defaults are -- for example, if we offer monthly stats, and they're for specific calendar months instead of just 30-day ranges, people will tend to use those over and over, making caching more effective. We don't have to forbid other types of queries, but the defaults will be much more heavily used. But all these approaches will be useful, no doubt. Great details here!

Thanks a lot for both this detailed proposal and for your excellent energy in taking on features and problems across the codebase! And for helping other newcomers by breaking out and documenting issues. 

The only thing I'd finish with is to say that you should be sure to pace yourself -- don't exhaust yourself, and find a pacing which you can sustain, and have fun! Thanks again!
