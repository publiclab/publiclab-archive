The audio jack seems like a decent stop-gap. Long term, however, I would highly suggest trying to work with the likes of Mozilla to get some kind of browser USB access (and maybe Bluetooth as well) codified. Mozilla is doing a good bit of related work already for Firefox OS, and most new phones should be able to play host to USB devices thanks to USB OTG. There will come a time when high-speed data transfer to scientific web applications will be invaluable, so I say let's get started on it now.
