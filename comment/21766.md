Hi [@rexagod](/profile/rexagod) ! Very nice ideas! Complete react migration seems quite ambitious, but having developed apps using react and react native I can say that the advantages you highlight are true, and the platform is easy to maintain and scale like few others. If we decide for the migration, you can count on me for any help that you might need developing it my friend!
