You know what, I believe this was because there's a "(" in the title. 

Yes -- I was able to upload and calibrate a version which I'd renamed without "(" or "_" characters -- just "20161024_131831.jpg" -- https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/89557

Hope that helps! I believe we have a bug report for that issue but I'll check.
