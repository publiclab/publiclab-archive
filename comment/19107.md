Thanks so much [@warren](/profile/warren) ! 

Ok so i tried hosting using the `gh-pages` branch . The link to Webpage is : 

https://sagarpreet-chadha.github.io/Leaflet_learning/

However i have changed the `cdn` links to the actual links and not to the one's locally stored in `node_modules` folder in index.html file , i think `node_modules` folder is very large and hence not uploaded to github server or maybe it is still uploading ?

If the node_modules folder is still uploading , then this webpage should work after some time , https://sagarpreet-chadha.github.io/Leaflet_learning/example/example1.html , right ?

What do you think ?

 And will try to update my proposal today . Thanks !
