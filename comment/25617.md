I'm interested in how data can be presented in very visual ways for advocacy work - like these kinds of images for air pollution:

But also, overlaying visual data on a map (just a still image, not an interactive map), kind of like how people did in this post on [#h2s](/tag/h2s) by [@ewilder](/profile/ewilder):

Images like these can be really powerful ways to communicate without getting into jargon, and they can be great ways to present even official data sources that's more legible.
