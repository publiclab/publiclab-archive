First, see  somagen.com/products/biolumix/  The instrument was quite interesting.  It used transmitted light and cylinders, not plates.  My friend used it to dramatically shorten testing time for some micro testing.  Don't think it would be usable for this app.  This type of work requires reflected light, not transmitted.  By the way, something on the page that got my attention was "no moving parts".  Good luck.
