I tried this camera https://www.aliexpress.com/item/HD-Surveillance-camera-1080p-Full-Hd-MJPEG-30fps-High-Speed-CMOS-OV2710-Mini-CCTV-Android/32811887520.html , but it have a bug with manual exposure setting. The exposure is set to a drastically lower value (picture is dark), so for spectrometer is useless.

These is my 1st Beta Spectrometer with borrowed industrial camera, "written" in LabView

On a screen is a spectrum of two white along with two 660nm LEDs
