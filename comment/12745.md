This is a sketch of new version, with rectangular base. This would prevent the nose slopping around. Still tapers to a width equal to the webcam. Also, slightliy steeper pitch to the back, to allow it to be scooched up to the back of the box to get proper distance from the slit.

This is just sketch of the final shape, obviously. needs to be exploded out into cut file.
