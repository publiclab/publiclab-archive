Yes, please do share and let us know how your week of aerial mapping goes: that sounds like a great project! When we get helium in NYC we go to a place that supplies industrial gasses (think welding-supply and big hardware stores): you just put a deposit on a tank and return it after-- if you go this way you *may* need to also rent or buy a regulator nozzle (like this: https://www.amazon.com/Helium-Regulator-Filler-Valve-Balloons/dp/B001T9HBMG). Otherwise any local florist or party store should be able to help you out!
