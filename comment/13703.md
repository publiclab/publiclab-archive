Great work. We'd discussed at the barnraising, the possibility (as you mention) of measuring the opacity using absorption spectroscopy, or even a printed opacity chart. If opacity changes linearly with dilution, the hope is that we could correct for the effects of dilution by only comparing different oils at a fixed opacity. Have you had an opportunity to try this?
