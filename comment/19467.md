Hello, [@warren](/profile/warren)! 

I'm at a startup, qri (https://qri.io/), where we're building an open source dataset version control tool. I've been working with Liz Barry to identify a Public Lab project where that might particularly helpful, so I wanted to reach out. 

If you'd be interested, I'd be happy to explain where we are in developing the tool and whether / how it might be useful to you. Here are a few ways to learn more about what we're building in the meantime:

github: https://github.com/qri-io

Let me know if you'd like to discuss in more detail. Thanks!
