Thank you for the reply.  The new page is much better.  As for quartz cuvettes, I used them for 28 years in UV/vis instruments.  That was part of the confusion.  I didn't know they made PTFE cuvettes.  Most of the "cells" we made were out of polystyrene or ABS and had a cutoff of about 325 nm.  (300 nm. If you pushed it).  As for the sampling of water, the plant used an ISCO sampler with quart glass jars.  The samples would have pH, temp, as well as name of sampler, date and time pulled, and were then acidified before being put in the refridgerator.  The thermometers had to go through the whole calibration procedure to make sure they were accurate, as did the pH meter. Plenty more details....But you get the idea.
