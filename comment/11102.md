The notes on the directions are super helpful! there are some real commonalities between your troubles with the directions and [@stoft](/profile/stoft)'s, I'll get on those revisions.

I also need to run through an oil testing tutorial, but I've had pretty good results with oil fluorescence with this model, I'll email you about that trouble.  We'll also make an add-on for holding the laser shortly. 

I want to add a few design notes:

The lid ripping off is a problem with the laser-scored fold that shouldn't be an issue when we switch to a die cutting process becuase it will be a crushed fold spot, not a score.  We may have to put a piece of re-enforcing tape on the hinge, but this definitely won't be an issue in the final.

The slit cards will have a printed line for lining up the collimation slit, there's just no printing on this version.

I will throw trademark caution into the wind and label all the off-brand hook and loop fasteners Velcroâ„¢.

the smush factor: I spent much of the last month roughly stuffing a prototype of this spectrometer in a duffle bag or backpack and it has done fine.  It also fits snuggly inside the box it shipped in, along with other spectrometry supplies.  I'd keep it in that box.
