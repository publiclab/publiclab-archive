Hi [@icarto](/profile/icarto),
How about having resque as the queuing backend (required for activejobs). We could use [Capistrano Resque](https://github.com/sshingler/capistrano-resque) in association with [resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) in production. 
Resque provides a really nice interface to monitor all the background jobs as shown below:-

Your thoughts on this??
