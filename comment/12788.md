Very good summary and really good ideas for revisions. The concern about not only humidity but also oil contact makes a plastic housing version something to investigate. I like the idea of adding similar double-wall construction to the cuvette frame, too.

The laser around kids is a real concern, as it is not a laser pointer you'd want to play with, as it is in the UV range that can injure eyes! I still want to review the safety issues around this, and suggest we actually seal the laser in a way that you have to read the warnings before opening it, not just including warnings in the printed matter.

I prefer to not even call it a pointer at all, and I want to make sure that word isn't included in our documentation. It's the "eye injuring stick" when I ask for it.

thanks for the great note on assembly!
