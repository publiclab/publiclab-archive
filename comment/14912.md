With some rig/camera combinations and with certain wind conditions any of these techniques could work. I might use any of them if I assembled the rig myself and inspected it before the flight. For a commercial product which could be used by anyone with various cameras in lots of different wind conditions, an eventual failure is likely. 

I would not recommend using wooden dowels for any load bearing component of an aerial camera rig. Fiberglas and carbon fiber rods and tubes do not add that much to the material costs and provide a substantially greater strength per weight ratio. The stronger material allows much simpler locking solutions like a single small pin through the shaft. A pin is much easier for an inexperienced user to assemble correctly so the chance of failure decreases. 

People who are flying $100 cameras are probably willing to pay more than $15 for a smart, safe, and easy to use system for attaching the camera to the flying line.
