It's a good point -- esp. always to be sure that the scope of the test is clear. The idea here was more exploratory, but in general this kind of conductivity test is not a test of drinkability or safety -- just an indicator of comparative change. 

I've seen some DIY PCR work -- have you done any of that kind of thing? What's your interest in tapwater research?

Thanks!
