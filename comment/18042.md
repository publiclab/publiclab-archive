I am not clear of which instrument you are suggesting about ? i have mentioned my own work (still will write and share more about it, which i hope will be useful for others), as well as other projects like RAMANPI.

There is a class of spectrometers that work based on Fourier Transform - FT spectrometers which basically collecting interferograms by setting up interference using interferometers (ex: michelson interferometer using moving plates + beamsplitter mechanism). Those are awesome too. Nowadays with SOC's avaialble with inbuilt FT & math abilities can perform them efficiently. 

However, the one i worked does not provide a interferogram, instead provide rapid access to any particular spectral response (a or a few particular wavelengths) from direct absorption/emission/reflection spectrum using a grating/pgp/vpg/aotf/lctf diffraction mediums.
