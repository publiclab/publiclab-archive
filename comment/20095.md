If you are trying a direct comparison ( apples to apples), see how the analytical lab is testing your samples.  Probably, they will be using an advanced ( read expensive) method. 

If there is a choice, see if you can find a base colorimetric or spectrometric method for your tests.  The spectrometer works well with this variety of tests.  

Having said that, spectrometers are built into many other instruments.  Its just the cost of modifying the instrument.

Good luck
