This white balance stuff got me thinking. I don't think the white balance actually changes the amount of light recorded by the sensor but instead modifies what is recorded by the sensor using the assumption that whatever was used as a white balance target has an even color response across all wavelengths recorded by the camera. That's why you get great blue band separation using a blue white balance target as you describe here: http://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/09-11-2013/infrared-behavior-of-a810. In effect the custom white balance an on-board Infragram snadbox (http://infragram.org/static/sandbox/). I wonder if you recorded using RAW to actually know what is being recorded by the sensor you would be able to predict the response to different white balance targets. In other words would you be able to simulate algorithms from the Infragram sandbox simply by using custom white balance. It seems straightforward to me but things usually do until I actually try it.
