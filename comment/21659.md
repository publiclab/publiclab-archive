[@liz](/profile/liz) you are right, "Publish" doesn't sound right, I changed it to "Add New" (so there's still a definite call to action).  I believe everything will be clear to the user once they click on the button (as the text box will expand and they will have to fill in the title and state whether it's a research note or a question).

Thank you for the sitemap - bookmarked! It's going to come in handy :)
