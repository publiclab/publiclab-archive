[@warren](/profile/warren) raman scattering is usually a very weak effect, and not easily seen. The stokes and anti stokes lines are very small compared to the main fluorescence peak since very few molecules are in excited states at room temperature. 

I'm not sure what causes the 405 nm laser light to spread out in the ghostly effects like it is in cuvette 2. Could that be bloom from overloading the CCD/CMOS photon detectors in the webcam? I think I remember hearing that if one area of the sensor is overloaded, that can bleed over to adjacent wells in the sensor and appear as signals in neighboring wavelengths...?
