[@marlokeno](/profile/marlokeno) material and charge probably matter quite a bit.  There are several research projects using the charge of certain particles for detection. One such passive monitor (for detecting nitrates and sulfates) is :

These charge effects on deposition are something we have to test 's something we have to control for in the passive monitors.  We have made several prototypes from plastics (much easier fabrication) and are going to compare to aluminum prototypes. I'm still getting the housings cut but I brought one to WI to show.

[@philrosenberg](/profile/philrosenberg), Thanks for linking to UFL's primer! I wish I'd seen it before. real nice.  I'd love to see your thoughts on the page I illustrated trying to explain the issue of droplet mode particles and humidity:
https://publiclab.org/wiki/pm#Droplets

The problems to control for on these electronic sensors are significant, from inlet efficiency, lack of impactors, variation in flow issues and calibration issues from 'wet particle counts.  I linked to a few reviews of these systems in my wiki page version of this note:
