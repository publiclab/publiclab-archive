I have another question.  Would this kit be good for testing and measuring LED lights (wavelength, lumens, etc)? The first objective would be to validate claims made by companies that sell grow lights.  The second would be to measure LED lights where specificatipns are not given.  I want to build LED grow lights in a custom configuration.  However I want to buy some sample LEDs and test them before committing to a larger purchase.
