Egads!  Mat, thanks for pointing this out!  I totally flubbed that one:  in the 555 approach, the signal that is passing through the water is indeed DC, as you say; it's the oscillatory signal coming out of the 555 (and not going through the water) that we're measuring.  I think in my head I was conflating several discussions with Ben around more than one method, as well as some discussions l'd had with Julian Tyson about potentiostats (also only vaguely understood). 

Good point on the 2cm apart figure for the electrode spacing -- I'm now playing with a metal screw configuration that places the screws 1 cm apart -- and they could like be placed .5 cm apart without any extra tricks ... I made a dumb little circuit board that holds the pressure / temp sensor we'd selected, and has some holes that are suitable (i think) for m3 screws: https://github.com/p-v-o-s/riffle-ito/blob/master/riffleito-CTD-REVA-board.png -- if it works, the closer spacing would be around 4 mm apart ...

Yeah, the capacitor method seems cheapest / simplest / lower power -- and if the power issues are the same as with the 555, then why not ... I should ping the better Ben brains on this one ...
