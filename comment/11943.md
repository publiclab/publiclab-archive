Hi Pat

Thanks for your suggestion on the Forum address

I bought a Canon A1200 just like you, and two filters from Cris, one of them the Wratten25, which are on their way.

Regarding your A1200 conversion;  after doing it and before putting in the Wratten 25 filter, did you have problems with focusing ? I ask because if the focus on the camera is based on the image or light passing through a filter you are taking out, maybe the focusing gets altered

How about the focusing after placing in the Wratten filter ? 

Thank you
