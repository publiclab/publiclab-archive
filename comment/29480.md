Another approach is to look at the elevation shown for the cursor location in Google Earth Pro, as in this example (it is small, hard to see in the preview, but 3' appears after the lat lon values, in the bottom left of the window. A Google search for "How accurate is the Google Earth Pro elevation data for New York City?" provides perspectives on the accuracy of the elevation data. However, typically better than the elevation via handheld gps on your phone.
