It's absolutely a priority -- so much so, that throughout this note, I've treated it as a given that we're implementing it.

Let me try again on what I mean in that paragraph: 

* we spent [lots of effort](https://github.com/jywarren/plots/issues/53) to strip down the research note form and simplify it
* both Markdown and our shorter, smaller form are especially bad at long-form work
* we are implementing a WYSIWYG editor to address the Markdown problem
* I hope that in all these efforts, we keep ensuring that our interfaces are simple and clear
* I think a move towards longer form has value but has to be balanced against the advantages of a shorter form

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to just skip over our nearer-term plans here; I'm just looking ahead to what'll come after that. So when I want us to account for selection bias, I mean with regard to longer vs. shorter notes and other issues we'll be facing after the WYSIWYG project. I hope that addresses your concerns!
