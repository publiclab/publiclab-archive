A five minute epa threshold is 35 * 12 = 420 ug/m3. If a measurement hits this high, we know within 5 minutes that it has exceeded an hourly threshold
8:33
A ten minute epa threshold is 35 * 6 = 210 ug/ m3
8:34
The purple air / woodsmoke basically takes a reading every two minutes. That threshold is 950, which is crazy. All of these are pretty high

but we have seen readings over 400
