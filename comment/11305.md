I find that picking up a cheap used cannon camera and loading CHDK works a lot better then having to remove the distortion from a "fisheye" lens (with hundreds of photos)...and if your post processing software can handle the fisheye, it typically takes a lot longer to process. If you do put another camera on it, I would suggest isolating the vibrations to the camera. There are multiple way of doing this, most gimbals use rubber dampers. Ive also seen thick gage wire and ear plugs used. Maybe you can use what is on the Phantom and pull the camera part off. If you cant isolate the vibrations, make sure your props are balanced.  If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me and I can go into more depth.
