That is a good question.  I'm not sure what assay you could do at home, or whether it would distinguish BPA that got in the water from epoxy coatings of old town water pipes from that that leached in from your own piping.
Sweden has the longest history of BPA research and regulation, I'd look at their research:

Conjecturally, I would expect to find BPA (if found at all) in PVC piping, but not in PEX, since phtalates are used as plasticizers in PVC but rarely a part of polypropylene or polyethylene plastics.
