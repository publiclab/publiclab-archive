Is there a chance to beta-test the SkyShield out with a custom rig?  I'd be happy to do all the soldering if necessary.  Or I'll patiently wait for the full release :)  

I really like the form factor, the mode switch (should be standard on all arduino boards IMO), and that you're doing a cooperative Arduino auto-KAP project.  Many people have gone down the road without documenting very well what they have done.  For the most part it's been a lot of people starting from scratch and working fairly hard to get to the similar points.  I think you have a good start on something people can add on to and modify in useful ways.  Leaving some input and output pins available leaves quite a few options for sensors and cameras.
