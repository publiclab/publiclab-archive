Hi [@warren](/profile/warren), good point and I agree. 

Thinking about it, I think it's likely that the visitors to the page will be interested in either a specific cause or looking to get involved locally. The third one would be the DIY tools, which link to both the causes and the local projects. I've changed the first section (the one after the sign-up button) to feature a Find a project near me button. 

Let me know what you think. 

As always here: https://edieblu.github.io/pl-welcome.io/ :)
