I like the bulge. It might be more forward than it has to be (it blocks screwdriver access to the front screws) and not out to the sides as much as it could. Below is a model with a crude blob I stuck on one side to suggest where the bulge should be to thicken the side wall of the leg tube.

Ignore the shape of my bulge, only the general location is relevant. I haven't learned Fusion 360 well enough to edit your excellent models, so I just glommed a shape onto the side in Sketchup. Below you can see that the bulge extends back over the screw hole. The idea is to beef up the volume on the outer sides of the leg holes.

I guess I need to start watching Fusion 360 videos.
