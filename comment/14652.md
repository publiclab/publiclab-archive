i'm talking out of my depth here-- I know basic electronics and am not an electrical engineer by any stretch-- but a quick 1.9v dip sounds to me like one fo two things:
a capacitor charging up in the system, which would explain why adding the battery improves the situation because it charges faster.

or you're overcoming the forward voltage drop of the schottky diodes and adding the battery helps because its on the other side of half the schottkys.
