Those photos look good. I used the [Photo monitoring plugin](https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/01-13-2016/packaged-photo-monitoring-plugins-available-on-the-github-repositoy) to make the NDVI image below. I used the blue channels from both photos because these provided good separation between the NIR and VIS channels. The color scale is from -1.0 (left) to +1.0 (right).

A lot of the difference between your NDVI image and mine is the color gradient used.
