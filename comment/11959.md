Anyway, tomorrow if I have time I am going to upload a new research note on chromatography that i think it will be really interesting for detecting and isolating compounds,and coming back to the metal detection i have carried out an specific quantitative analysis of metallic cations in solution some time ago and as i have told you before i would suggest you to use them, they are very simple chemical reactions but at the same time very precise, and not only for metal cations but there are also well-Known specific reactions to detect the presence of specific groups such as phenols , that produce a color change in the visible range that would allow us to determine not only the presence but also the amount of analyte in solution.
