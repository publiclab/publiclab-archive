[@Ned](/profile/Ned), do you already have a spectral sensitivity curve for the canon A2200, with its ir block filter removed (similar to the Nikon curve above)? If you do, is there any way you could post that here, or send it to me?

Also, is there a good method I can use to create that sensitivity curve for myself? 

Thanks!
