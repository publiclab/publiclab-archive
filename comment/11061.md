Chris,
you're definitely right about the long thin piping, it is designed to be completely "potted," or filled with some sealant or epoxy.  Its the best way I can think of to encapsulate wires and get them out of an enclosure. I'm less certain that a seal is needed between the tube and the bung.  As you said:
"the bung can probably be made to seal well because it can be permanently gooped and/or because the bung will exert inward pressure if it is jammed into a hole."
exactly. it has 2.5cm of vertical contact area in the bung, the top 1 cm of which is under significant compression.  Look at this comparison:

I don't think the bottle neck is the week link. PET bottle necks are amazingly strong.  The body of the bottle is the weak link, especially when a water bottle is chosen, since many water bottles aren't designed to take pressure and are much thinner than pop bottles.  I think PET bottles are up to the job, having worked with them as floats when I was a life guard. With the caps sealed they would last several seasons, often getting tossed on shore with cinder blocks. 
What usually breaks on a PET bottle is the cap.  The bigger the cap, the bigger the problem.  A juice bottle, dropped cap down, will often shatter open. Pop bottles have a smaller cap and are a little stronger, but still an issue.   [There are reusable caps](http://www.amazon.com/LiquidBread-Liquid-Bread-Carbonater/dp/B0067MZMW6/) made for home carbonation that are thicker and stronger.  Also, if the electronics are small, PET blanks, called "preforms" or "soda bottle preforms" [can be purchased](http://www.hometrainingtools.com/assorted-giant-test-tubes/p/wo-gtestube/) and are incredibly thick and strong (but only 5" long).

I'd like to keep the housing reparable and replacible though, I like having the housing be a bottle-- that said, it might be worth distributing some more durable components, especially caps.
