OK, while we're tackling some of the discussion of gain correction in https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/02-25-2015/plab-spectrometer-gain-correction#c13258, I wanted to confirm that this is the right product here, Dave:

How important is the power source for consistency? Something like this? http://www.amazon.com/LET-60-Class-Electronic-Transformer-Lightech/dp/B002RSOULS/

One other question; is there a way to reproduce this method with an edison screw-type bulb, to simplify/cheapen the setup? I guess I'm not finding much... http://www.bulbs.com/Halogen_Bulbs/Medium_(E26)-Base/results.aspx Just thinking of how to make this process easier for folks. On the other hand, if we can test a bunch of the webcams against one another, a standard correction for a webcam type is a good start, anyways.
