It looks like the Coqui is a pretty well designed instrument.  But, some of the pharmaceutical instruments would send the tone through a bridge.  The top two legs of the bridge were just resistors.  The bottom leg on one side sent the tone through a calibrated cell ( the constant varied depending on the purity of the water).  The other side went to a calibrated set of resistors.  Between the two legs of the bridge was a meter(-,0,+).  The idea was to put the cell in the solution and adjust the resistance until the meter read zero.  Its rather old school.  But maybe the bridge part would help out?
