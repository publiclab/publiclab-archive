_The Pothole Report is a citizen sourced, community driven campaign to address the blight, transportation and development challenges that continue to affect the citizens and neighborhoods of the Greater New Orleans Metro Area. The Pothole Report listens to talk radio, reads the paper, and has ears and eyes in the street. We are looking for a handful of innovative, energetic and motivated individuals who are committed to supporting the success of a community-based development project._

It's not clear if they're active or if the project got off of the ground, but here is their twitter page: https://twitter.com/pothole_report?lang=en
