Hi Scott -- what kind of light are you using?

When i've done this, i've let it settle in a clear container so I can see that all the muck has really settled to the bottom, and I'm only eyedropping yellowish, but transparent, completely dissolved material, into the sample jars. Then not as much light is needed. I also think the [green laser technique](/notes/warren/05-14-2013/laser-oil-fluorescence-proof-of-concept) tends to be the most sensitive.
