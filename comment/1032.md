We've been talking about using a digital H2S sensor to get another measure of H2S to compare to. I think they can be bought online for like $100, though sensitivity may not be much more than 5ppm, since they're for safety more than for research. Any interest in getting one? I think if several of us chipped in we could buy one and ship it around with the strips, or to different test sites...
