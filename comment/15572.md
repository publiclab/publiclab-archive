All three Bayer filters (R,G,B) transmit some near IR light.

*Above: Spectral response of a Canon PowerShot A2200 before  (top) and after (bottom) the IR cut filter was removed.*

With the IR cut filter removed and a red filter blocking all blue light, the blue channel will capture NIR and maybe some green or UV depending on the filters.
