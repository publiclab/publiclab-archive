 With a quick search I found this (http://www.epa.gov/ttnemc01/methods/VECourse.pdf) and on page 3-6 it talks about visible gases being nitrogen dioxide which will have a yellowish brown color.  I was hunting a bit on google maps and the four stacks are a power plant(http://www.uspowergen.com/).  Couldnt find anything about the two-stack plant.  +1 for tag watchdog!
