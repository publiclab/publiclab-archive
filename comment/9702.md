Good tips. Did you figure out which settings caused your balloon flight photos to be overexposed?   
It looked like some of your photos were exposed well, while others were overexposed. Were any underexposed?  
It's harder to explain variable exposure like that.
The white balance and focus mode would not cause poor exposure. Over exposure could have been because ISO was set very high or exposure compensation was set to a positive number. I think exposure compensation is what your refer to in your number 4 (the square icon with +/-). 
Another possibility is that the camera was set to manual mode and the exposure was set wrong, but not all cameras have manual mode.
What kind of camera did you use?  
For a bright day, typical settings might be:  

- ISO at the lowest (80 or 100),  
- White balance on sunny or cloudy,  
- Focus mode on infinity,  
- Exposure compensation on 0 or -2/3.

How did you trigger the shutter? If you used a rubber band, that could explain everything.
