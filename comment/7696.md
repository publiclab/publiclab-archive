Would the LED have to be placed outside the entrance slit? Otherwise the grating would form an image of the entire bulb.  Standard single color LEDs do not have narrow peaks, so even outside of the slit they would form a broad band. The advertised bandwidths of 2 to 10 nm ignore the wide tails which typically seem to cover 30-40 nm. So they are maybe not so useful for wavelength calibration. For intensity calibration I guess the battery current would have to be constant across multiple uses. Depending on the brightness of the sample spectrum, the LED spectrum would influence exposure, for better or worse.
