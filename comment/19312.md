[@sekjal](/profile/sekjal). I was amazed by the use of Lego. I wanted to ask you if it was possible to make a wall riding car similar to one shown by [@Mathew](/profile/Mathew) or this slim version of the <a title="wall climbing car" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKGzwa5lV20">wall climbing car</a> using Arduino alone?
This one uses a quick charging module. I am not interested in that. However, in future I would like to take this project to a new level where I can integrate a miniature solar panel on the car ceiling. Is that an overkill?
Any thoughts on that?
