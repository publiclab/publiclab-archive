Try to monitor the amount the company is polluting and also, what the exact chemicals are.  For example, while chloroprene is off gassed, there are probably other related chemicals discharged, as well.  These could be solvents used in manufacturing.  Some could be listed in EPA documents.  

But testing might also need to be done.  And doing testing will cost money.  Just so you are aware.  Everyone is looking for inexpensive, accurate tests that anyone can do.  These do exist, but often with interferences, or other problems. 

Usually, for the testing to be accepted in court, you may have to go to approved labs, which adds to cost.  That doesn't mean all the testing needs to be done at the high cost labs, but some probably will.  

It's a challenge.  But you can do it!
