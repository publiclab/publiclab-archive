OK, thanks for the tips. I adjusted the white balance so the images are more orangey. However, now the blue channel image generated does not look like a normal black and white photo. It's darker and grainier. The red channel looks correct because it's unnaturally bright, although it might also be a bit grainy. I would think that near infrared light has "leaked", as is mentioned on the description, but I didn't have this problem until I adjusted the white balance, and it's not the result that describes the leakage. Is there anything you know of that might cause this? Thanks. Here are my results I'm talking about: http://infrapix.pvos.org/show/schoolpath.jpg
