Cool Matthew! One of the things we were worried about was light leaks and how much that would disturb the paper which is light sensitive. We put holes in the bottom of the canister so that sunlight couldn't directly hit the holes- could you do the same rubberband process with the holes on the bottom? 

A broader question for others... have we just tested the strips to see what they do when they are exposed to light and no H2S is present? I didn't see a note for this after a quick look.
