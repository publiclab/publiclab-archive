quick question -- are "primary tags" the most interconnected tags, or would there be a manual step of choosing them?

Glad to see there is a way to get started on this. While I appreciate the computational need for "recent," it is also true that i find it nervewracking to meet my responsibility to helping people find the topics they are interested in when everything is calculated by recently modified. After we get this first step done, i might have a suggestion that we lean on prior work done by [@bsugar](/profile/bsugar) that shows these clusters, and potentially also include some that are not recently modified.
