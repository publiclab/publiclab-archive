Hi Mercy - Thanks for the update. It's great to read about the progress. I tried to run Sky Cam on my Samsung Tab 2.0 and after the app starts I get an error "Unfortunately, Sky Cam has stopped". Is there anything I can do to help debug this problem? My tablet does not have phone access. Could that be a problem? I checked the GPS and it seems to be working ok. I'm running Android 4.2.2

Is the guide only available using the app? I wasn't sure where to look for the "Homepage >> 'Guide' menu >> Sky cam guide" menu items. 

It would be great to see if other people are able to get the app working. I'm not very familiar with Android app so it's possible I'm  doing something wrong.
