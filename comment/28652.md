> changing the url to https://publiclab.org/contributors/tagname

Here, i like the idea. I worry that the topic title itself doesn't look clickable and we do want MOST traffic going to the lead tag/topic page of /tag/TAGNAME, so i'm interested to hear ideas on how to ensure that is the primary destination from this whole card. Does an underline on the title look bad? Another idea? Thanks!

> Share your work button

Here, i hear you -- and appreciate the thoughts. The big advantage to pushing people to post /into/ a topic is that you can skip explaining what tags are. The "Share your work" button is just posting without a topic, so it's something we may want to try to think of another way around. 

We already try to recognize when there aren't many topics being followed and encourage people to follow more. Is there some way we can either show people that you have to follow more to take part in discussions (including posting) or to... offer a chance to post but ask them to find a topic to post into? I'm not sure. But that was the reasoning behind moving all posting into specific topics rather than providing a high-visibility button that posts into no topic. We really want people to be thinking in terms of topic groups!

Thanks for all your thought on this!!!
