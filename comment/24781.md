 [@stoft](/profile/stoft) I tried reading about the raw RGB ouput on the picamera documentation but I did not find the description to have too much information, but maybe I just need to read more. To me it seems like a black box right now and hopefully by reading we can gain more confidence about how to control the camera consistently. That link [@warren](/profile/warren) posted seems like it has quite bit of good info that is not found on the pi documentation.
