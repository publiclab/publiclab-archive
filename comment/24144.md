Hey [@Skorex](/profile/Skorex)!

Sorry for the delay.  I'm not sure if you're looking for a measurement of the actual spectrometer that you have photographed, or if you are looking for a measurement of a particular spectrum that you created in spectral workbench (SW).

If it's a spectrum from SW, see this question that was recently asked [here](https://publiclab.org/questions/janajockovic47/05-05-2019/can-you-give-me-mesure-for-spectrum-thank-you).

Feel free to comment over there if you'd like more help since it will notify all of the people already in that thread.
