Isn't that what research notes are for? Aren't research notes how we keep up with each others' activities? If research notes fail to accomplish this, it might be due to:

1. People doing Public Labish things fail to post research notes about them, or
2. There aren't many people doing Public Labish things.

If number 1 is true, then a solution might be related to:

1. Making it easier to post research notes, or 
2. Making it more rewarding to post research notes. 

Lots of thought and energy has been devoted to both of these things, but there is probably much more that could be done.
