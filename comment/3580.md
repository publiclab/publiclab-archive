Gerhard,
The exposure on that spectrum is almost perfect.  There was a little too much light at 336 nm, and that peak is flattened a bit. The channel that was overexposed was the green one, which makes sense since it is a peak of green light.  The other two channels are also sort of flat at that peak because that peak is a double peak.  With a narrower slit and good focus, you should be able to resolve the double peaks which are actually at 543 and 546 nm.
