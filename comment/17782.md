Great suggestions, Chris. Also:

This is more or less the idea behind a stable API -- you don't have to know how it works inside the box, as long as you can rely on it working the same way. If you were relying on a library in this way, and the author changed what it did, they'd be breaking the API, rendering your "downstream" code useless. 

Some of the best comments can clearly delineate what a block of code does as it's "external interface" without having to go through explaining every line. Then anything inside that block could be changed, as long as it fulfills that external promise.
