Excellent. A really clear detailed explanation of how to get started. Some years ago I built a dedicated kit receiver for recording WX pictures. Unfortunately it is no longer supported and the software program in it became out of date as earlier satellites became silent and new ones were launched.  I have installed all the relevant software you listed on my MacBook and dusted off my old home made QFH. Now just waiting for the SDR dongle to arrive so I can try it out.

One problem I found - downloading the WXtoImg dmg from the link you have resulted in a corrupt file which couldn't be run. I had to get it from a different site.
