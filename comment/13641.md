Hi Chris,

I replaced IR filter with rosco fire filter#19 in OV5642 camera module to replicate infragram‘s point & shoot camera.I captured images for check the plant health. So,I converted these images into NDVI images using python script.

[![white_balance_edited.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/014/355/medium/white_balance_edited.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/014/355/original/white_balance_edited.jpg)

OV5642 camera module 's captured image

Using python script's converted NDVI image

Queries,
1) What are the point i have to take care when i capture the image?
2) Please suggest me some point which are helpful to make NDVI index and NDVI image better.

Please let me know if you need more information from my side.

Regards,
Parth
