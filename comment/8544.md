Hey just bumping this back up -- using Infragram.org Mathew L and I did a quick re-try on this, using the expression `((R-B)/(R+B))*-1` in the Hue for HSV:

It looks OK, so we tried just doing a monochrome diff between B and R; boosting it threefold `1-3*(B-R)` :

There's a false positive on the pavilion roof but it seems like there is measurable and fairly low-noise differentiation between R and B channels. We would of course be REALLY HAPPY if we could use a Mobius for the Point and Shoot Infragram... Chris, can you help battle-test this idea? Is our methodology flawed? Does this merit more tests?
