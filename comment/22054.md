 Thanks a lot [@IgorWilbert](/profile/IgorWilbert) Yes I think you are right, we can explore more on this. When I saw PL Editor's code, it was very well written however a lot of it involved using plots2, so I thought that we could make good use of plots2 here, by putting the load on the server. But I am very open to exploring the client side strategy as well, since there are some good CSV parsing JS libraries as well!
