Thanks Matthew, that's good to know. I suppose the IR response might be better if both the lens filter and the dye on the grating weren't present. My second test plot shows more than double the amplitude for the 570 to 630nm yttrium oxide(?) red phosphor peak from the fluorescent lamp. Which might mean that there is a healthy response even lower down.
