Nice mosaics. Where are you flying from? The street? I don't see any park nearby. 

Which mode were you using? it looks like there might not be enough overlap among photos in the upper rows. The A495 does not have a very wide angle lens. It is 37mm (eq.) compared to 28mm for typical small PowerShots. I think we need another mode for lenses like that. The current modes probably will not produce enough overlap in the upper rows. That's a really important thing to learn.

Does Photomerge allow different projections of the stitched panorama? ICE has 10 different projections that can be applied after the panorama is stitched. 

Thanks Pat.
