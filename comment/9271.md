We generally prefer the manual ["yo-yo" reels](http://store.publiclab.org/collections/mapping/products/balloon-mapping-reel) because of their durability.  Those little winders you're using definitely break at high loads.  I have [one of these](http://www.emmakites.com/11-28cm-strong-stainless-kite-line-reel-winder-lock-5-roller-brakes-control_p166.html) as well, its a little tricky and the string can jam up the brake if I'm not careful. its nice for flying alone, but when two or more people are with me I go to the yo-yo reels-- they're easier to learn on and simple enough not to cause much trouble.  On my own the yo yo isn't bad either, but if I have to rapidly pull in a lot of string I'll have to drop the reel and make a mess.
