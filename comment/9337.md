On Monday last week (06/23) the Concerned Citizens of Cherokee in Pascagoula held a meeting where Howard Page (of the Steps Coalition) Wes Smith (production manager at Mississippi Phosphates) and Barbara Weckesser (of Cherokee Concerned Citizens) each spoke. The purpose was to discuss the problem and to define steps that Mississippi Phosphates will take to clean up their act. Prior to the meeting Mississippi Phosphates offered the neighborhood group an air quality monitor (according to the Mississippi DEQ) but I've not been able to find any more details. I'm curious to know what was offered or what the plan for monitoring is. If the company itself is directing the effort, I'm not over confident in the interpretation of results, which should be made public.
