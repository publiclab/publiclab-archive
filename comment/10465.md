Hi
I have problems get it working correctly. I tried your code with an Arduino MEGA 2560 (with changing the Pins in your code to mine). on the first run with using the Serial Monitor  it seems to get valid values. Next run always get full 5V signal from all diodes. Anyone an idea why?

It also didn't accepts the values I type in Serial Monitor. Here is what I get when entering 50ms for Integration Time:

Mode (1:Absorbance, 2:Transmitance, 3:Series)

3

Intergration Time (ms)

-24288

Run Interval (sec)
