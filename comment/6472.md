Chris -- I'm looking into generating the color table you're using -- it does indeed nicely distinguish above- and below-zero NDVI values -- and I'll hope to be able to edit it such that (max, min) values to produce (black, white) in the image, respectively. 

And re: the great, suggested diagnostic for NIR leakage into the blue channel:  I added a grayscale rendering of only the blue channel.  An example, using the image in this research note, is [here](http://infrapix.pvos.org/show/sat2.png).
