Very nice!

I'm curious how fast the gilder moves through the water.  I'm currently working on [making temperature sensing boards](http://publiclab.org/notes/lperovich/07-07-2015/thermal-fishing-bob-faster-waterproofed-temperature-sensors) to use with the Riffle.  The thermistors initially used for the thermal fishing bob didn't seem to be fast enough for quicker moving systems (i.e. kayak, sailboat....this?).

By the way, the amazon link to the temperature sensor in the BOM seems to be broken.  Here's what I think they're recommending: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11931

I think this is in the same ballpark of the sensor I'm currently using.  I'm wondering if you (or anyone else) has characterized the response time of this sensor?  Especially under various methods of waterproofing?
