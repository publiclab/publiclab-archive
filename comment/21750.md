Combining these into one map should be pretty straightforward with Leaflet Environmental Layers -- a project we've developed with [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet)! 

https://publiclab.org/notes/sagarpreet/06-06-2018/leaflet-environmental-layer-library

You can read more at [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet)'s profile, and we should discuss opening an issue on the LEL github project for these layers. 

A couple quick queries - first, are the layers above publicly usable? I'd assume so, with attribution?

Second, do any of the layers listed on LEL (currently) seem useful to the subject of lead?
