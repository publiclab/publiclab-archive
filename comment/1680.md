This is incredible.

Quick thoughts:

-- Can't get more "open hardware" than a cardboard box.  Truly awesome.
-- This suggests to me using an R-Pi as a general purpose sensor platform, with plug & play sensors, an optional LCD ...
-- This also suggests combining an R-Pi as a base computer that interacts with e.g. Arduino/microcontroller sensors ... the R-Pi does the heavy processing / analysis, the Arduinos do the reliable sensing (microprocessor timing would be more reliable and consistent than having multi-thread Linux system running); R-Pi + Arduino scientific sensing / analysis platform ... can do everything you'd want to do in a science lab, for super cheap
