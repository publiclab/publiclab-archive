Hello, I met Brian at a recent 'geek day' event where he was talking about your design which sparked my curiosity in attempting to build one. Do you have a list of parts and sources? He said that it could be built for under $100. I assume that this does a better 'job' than the PL kit? I've never played with a spectroscope before (that I can recall) so it might be fun. I want to check for toxins in water. thx
