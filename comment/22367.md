Hi, I think the spectrum comparisons would be relatively straightforward -- but keep in mind that the kit requires a calibrated reference light to infer absolute measurements of brightness or intensity-calibrated spectra (#intensity-calibration), so lacking that, your comparison would be of lights relative to one another. 

To compare absolute brightness overall is a harder question, but I'd suggest that you divide the "view" of the device in two so you could measure two bulbs at once, on either side of a divider. 

If your bulbs are powered from the same source, and are identically aligned with the spectrometer (some kind of diffuser may be necessary, or perhaps scanning the light reflecting off a white surface, to ensure this), then scanning both at once in the same shot would ensure that the exposure compensation of the webcams is equal. Does that make sense? 

Open to other ideas, and [@stoft](/profile/stoft) has done a lot of potentially relevant work here.
