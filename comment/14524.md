There is a discussion of common materials with spectral data in the comments here:  https://publiclab.org/notes/LaPa/03-31-2016/raspberry-noir-cam-sensors-to-detect-water-stress-of-the-plants-during-their-growing

The sensors used in consumer cameras are sensitive to NIR, but not really very sensitive. Public Lab spectrometers use consumer digital cameras, and most use a webcam. If you know exactly how sensitive the camera is to NIR compared to red, you can use that camera to photograph the diffraction pattern of light reflected from a potential calibration target. Then you can apply a correction factor based on the known camera sensitivity in the red and NIR bands. I have seen very few spectral curves for small cameras that include the NIR region after the IR block filter has been removed, but here is one for a common Canon PowerShot used by some Public Lab folks.

*Above: The upper panel is the spectral sensitivity of a PowerShot A2200. The lower panel is the same camera's sensitivity after the IR block filter was removed.*

Typically, spectral scans of potential targets are made with a light source of precisely known spectral characteristics, which presents another potential obstacle. It might be possible to use the sun for the light source. But I'm not sure about that.
