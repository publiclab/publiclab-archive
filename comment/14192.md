A few questions!

1. Ah, is sodium bicarbonate just baking soda?
2. Cool -- what's the purpose of a gain medium, i.e. what's the purpose of the baking soda? 
3. Where do you get fluorescein? 
4. Are you using fluorescein in combination with baking soda as your reagent, or do they play different roles?
5. how did you choose to use baking soda?
6. If I understand, you're hoping the reagent will bind with oils so that they fluoresce more strongly, right?
7. But this might destroy information about the type of oil, at the benefit of making a test for *any* oil more sensitive, correct?
8. How do we know that the reagent is binding with oil pollutants -- what else does it bind with? 

Can you share any background research which led you to try these techniques? 

Thanks Dave! Very interesting, just a lot to process, and I need help understanding the big picture here.
