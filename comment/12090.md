Even though you have it in the refrigerator I suspect that it is the result of time and perhaps humidity.  I have left my used tube lying around in the living room.  The indication color is all the way to the end of the measurement area.  Any chemist want to comment on the reaction? HCHO+(NH2OH)3.H3PO4->H3PO4+HCN=NOH+H2O
