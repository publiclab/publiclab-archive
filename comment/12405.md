Yes, I have noticed that mature habitats have lower spectral diversity than disturbed habitats.  

Here is a recent Diversidad analysis of a 3D image from GoogleEarth of Yosemite Valley, CA.  Note that there is no development at all in this image.  The Diversidad hotspots are trained on "edges" or ecotones.

When I have conducted biological surveys on Diversidad hotspots they almost always support higher species diversity than non hotspot areas - especially for birds and mammals.  Insect diversity does not correlate as well probably because they sample the environment in a much more "fine grained" way than do birds and mammals.  In other words, for Diversidad to work on insect diversity we would need super high resolution that is sub meter in resolution.

If you want to send me an image, I would be happy to run a Diversidad Analysis for you.  just email me a high res jpeg image.
