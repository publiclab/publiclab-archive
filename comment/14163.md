There are lots of examples of DIY spectrometers based on linear CCD detectors which are just single rows of pixels with no color filters over them. Here are a couple of notes at Public Lab:

The linear CCDs cost less than US$10 now. This design completely eliminates the variable sensitivity with wavelength caused by the consumer camera dependence on color filter arrays (Bayer filters). If you want to compare the intensities of different wavelengths in a spectrum, that is a much better approach than using a consumer camera.

Detecting Fraunhofer lines just requires good wavelength resolution. Using a narrow slit and a point and shoot camera instead of a webcam makes a few of the Fraunhofer lines pretty conspicuous:

If it is well adjusted, a webcam spectrometer can also detect some Fraunhofer lines. They show up in some sky spectra at Spectral Workbench.
