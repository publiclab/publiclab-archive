Here's an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1YXQMWMR1YL36?&sort=default">amazon list</a> of materials, including a different laser level that i think will be less of a hassle

I have the craftsman version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Distance-BEVA-Function-Measuring-Pythagorean/dp/B0744FLYJW/ref=sr_1_24_sspa?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1547427435&sr=1-24-spons&keywords=craftsman+laser+-socket&psc=1">this</a>, except all it does is distance
