Hi! A few of us tested out a <$100 trail cam which worked really well -- it has a lot of the features you might need:

https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/09-20-2016/zero-dark-thirsty-capturing-replenishing-nighttime-rain-events-with-a-trail-camera

We've tried to list out some of the considerations in choosing a camera here: https://publiclab.org/questions/stevie/09-06-2016/question-has-anyone-used-a-timelapse-camera-in-stream-monitoring

We're also trying to come up with a list of specs we want any camera to meet when doing this kind of work -- the fogging issue is a big one we didn't think of, but I guess the timelapse camera we found is designed for that, as it ran all night in a rain storm without trouble. Someone had originally posted these requirements:

* should be waterproof, able to survive inclimate weather.
* should be able to record photos at 10 minute intervals for minimum of 30 days without recharge.
* should be able to have data removed and battery replaced/recharged in the field by a non-technical user.
* should be able to be mounted to a variety of bases, in urban and natural environments.
* should be of a minimum of 8MP resolution.
* should have total BOM cost of less than $100.
* should provide accurate time stamp or ability to determine time/date for every photo

Can we send this to you for testing? Would you say that your setup has similar requirements, or different ones? Thanks for sharing!
