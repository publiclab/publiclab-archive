nice work Dave, very impressive. Some excellent diagrams and graphs.

I think that a lot of work that we might do with the spectroscope will be working with relative intensities, It is a huge task to get an absolute intensity reference that everyone can use, given the variety of lamps out there.

auto exposure is a pain !

In some recent work I did on absorbance and concentration, as you pointed out, my data were very noisy. I reckon I was seeing the CFL spectra underneath the halogen incandescent source despite pointing the 'scope directly at the halogen and away from the overhead flouros. 

I've been searching for a BW cmos camera without much success. Mostly very expensive.

thanks for the excellent research note
