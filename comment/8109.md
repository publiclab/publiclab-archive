The main reason your results differ from mine is that you did not have the home-made color lookup table I used. That lookup table is [now available here (at the bottom)](http://publiclab.org/wiki/photo-monitoring-plugin).
Here is the dialog box for processing the single (pink) displayed infrablue photo into NDVI and NRG:  

[![FijisingleBox.JPG](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/002/686/medium/FijisingleBox.JPG)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/002/686/original/FijisingleBox.JPG)  

Here is the dialog box for processing VIS/NIR image pairs into NDVI and NRG:  

[![FijiDualBox.JPG](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/002/687/medium/FijiDualBox.JPG)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/002/687/original/FijiDualBox.JPG)  
  
Changing some of the parameters in the dialog boxes can have dramatic effects on the results.

When you click OK in the box above, you will be asked for a text file of the image pairs. That file should be in this format:  

L:\Infra\TestPhotos\Andresc4\NIR\IMG_0093b.JPG, L:\Infra\TestPhotos\Andresc4\VIS\IMG_0093a.JPG
L:\Infra\TestPhotos\Andresc4\NIR\IMG_0152.JPG, L:\Infra\TestPhotos\Andresc4\VIS\IMG_0152a.JPG

One of the options of the plugin allows you to create a text file by inputting directory locations and other things. Sometimes I can figure out how to make that work.
