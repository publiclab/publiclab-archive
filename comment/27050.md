[@Markos](/profile/Markos) Thanks so much for finding and sharing this paper on aquatic foam!

The paper helped me better understand that surface water foams can contain a combination of naturally-occurring and artificial compounds. So, declaring that it's either natural OR artificial would probably be a challenge. But, foams are a place where polluting chemicals (like pesticides or heavy metals) can build up. So maybe the question is more, “Are polluting chemicals present and how much is there?”

Another interesting highlight from the article is that even foams produced by natural sources can indicate a problem. For instance, excess fertilizer use can lead to algae blooms, which can create lots of foam. The foam itself might be from natural sources, but the natural sources are responding to an artificial, polluting situation.
