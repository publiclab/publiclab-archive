Hi, I'm here again! I shoot a set of pictures by NoIR modulo cam and blue filter. I tryed finally different white balance.  The photo that I post is one of that set. I shoot it with the command line "raspistill awb off awbg 1.28,0.57 test128057.jpg". This photo of 3 plants in the sunny lihgt has, in leaves, the red and blue channel well separated in the histogram and the leaves seem as orange as in the photo that Cfastie posted as model. Could this photo have a meaning in NDVI?
