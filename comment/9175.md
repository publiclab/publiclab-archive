Oh right, Picasa. Picasa was once my primary photo organizer. Then Google started to link it up with Google+ so it became a front end to storing your photos online with Google. It got really confusing, and it seemed like the default action was uploading my photos to Google+ even if I didn't want them there. Picasa (Google+) and Flickr are great ways to store photos online, but kite mappers probably have too many photos to make that efficient or economical. I think Picasa is free and should be a good solution as long as you learn how to keep the photos only on your hard drive.
