Also, apart from integrating with React or any other frontend framework, I guess we can also plan towards making plots2 a PWA, although I see it is not a very big project but can be coupled along with React integration, if we are planning on taking this one up.

Also the idea for using React Native for a native mobile app by [@IgorWilbert](/profile/IgorWilbert) sounds pretty cool, integration of Google Analytics with React Native is quite simple and essentially, with so many packages for React Native, I guess we will be able to prototype a nice native app for both the platforms(iOS and Android).
