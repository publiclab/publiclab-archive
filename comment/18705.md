>* a row of small links or buttons under each item like "follow tagname" "ask a question" to encourage engagement
* a row of tiny bio pic thumbnails next to some of the "leading topics" for the digest time period, to show the different people involved?

I would definitely include follow tag and bio thumbnail, I am also thinking to include views or likes

>Reply by email is going to be a big one. That can also be broken up, maybe --
 * what about posting a new topic? Maybe each email also has a link that says "post to this thread" or "ask a question" and leads to a post page pre-populated with the relevant tags like https://publiclab.org/post?tags=tagname or https://publiclab.org/questions/new?tags=tagname

As the addition of "Ask a question","Post to this thread" deals with emails we already send, we can think of including these buttons to the email UI now. How about that?

>The digest could say "12 items posted on 4 tags you follow" -- and then offer "related topics" to follow as well, so people can expand their subscriptions.

Hmm.. "12 items posted on 4 tags you follow" needs improvisation as digest usually show short headings, we can discuss on this after the template is final.Addition of relevant topics is already on my list.

>One final thing -- a big one, perhaps towards the end if you have time -- what about using ActiveJob to fetch tweet responses and enable "reply by tweet" as well? Not sure how this would work, but then maybe you'd see a twitter icon instead of a comment balloon, and it'd link to the tweet that was copied in?

If I am getting it right, a feature like- if someone replies to any tweet on publicLab's handle, then that reply would be added as a comment to that node and would show a tweet icon with it (for highlighting). It's great idea !!!. I would certainly think about this after completing documentation of first 3 parts.

Thanks, [@warren](/profile/warren) for the feedback !!!
