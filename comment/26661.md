Thanks, Bronwen! I think its also for the filtering masks too, no? like this CDC facial hair mask from the CDC has been circulating and not related to respirator types  https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/FacialHairWmask11282017-508.pdf

I think either people donating masks that accommodate beards--Muslim men have achieved freedom of religion victories in prisons in recent years to allow religious specific items to be donated and homemade masks have also been cleared in some states if they go through the right groups. So either handmade outside or potentially made inside. 

I think guys on the inside just want the best barrier they can get as they can basically control zero aspects of their exposure other than their mask and their own hand washing when they have soap.  Like I've spoken to people that have a cell mates that refuse to wash hands or wear a mask and who have jobs that put them into contact w/ hundreds of people so really any level of improvement would be great. Its so strange to me that there is no resources on this (that I've been able to find)!
