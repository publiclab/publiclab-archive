 Just realize, these methods are far from being implemented.  The mercury one is " proof of concept", which means it still needs troubleshot, validated, etc. to be a standard method.  It also uses a mix of methods.  SPE( solid phase extraction ) either takes a robot or a person to do. The work and can be touchy, depending on the test done. Usually, the sample is spiked and recovery calculated.

The e. Coli method is based on a detector that is liquid nitrogen cooled.  Not your run of the mill instrument.  They tend to be much more expensive than a homemade type ftir.

Keep up the research!
