Can you tell me  whats the red filter used for....just taking off the infrared filter and getting R G B IR channels and separating those channels later would work the same right? .The channel separation can be easily done in Fiji App. I am also wondering in your case in RGB spectrum, the Red would be Near Infrared, Green would be Red and Blue would be Green right after adding red filter.Correct me if i am  wrong.
Can't a normal RGB camera take 4 spectrum after removing IR filter?

Look forward to your response.
