Also, Dave -- a question: if people work to reproduce this, what are (in your opinion) the tolerances here? Could people make this with a different width square dowel than you've shown? Must it be the same dimensions -- to the, say, 1/16 of an inch? Or does it not matter, and how would you make that judgement? Thanks again!
