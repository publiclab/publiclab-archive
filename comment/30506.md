There is such concern for the Burmese python introduction into the Florida Everglades because invasive species have been the cause of several animal extinctions. The python is now the apex predator of the Everglades. Invasive species have been a nuisance to the biodiversity of their non-native ecosystems. Other regions that have the potential of having the Burmese python explode in the population disrupting the ecosystem is Louisiana, Texas, and Southern California, etc. Mostly the southern United States. These regions are suitable for the python to thrive because of similar climates. Thanks to organizations like Public Lab, everyday citizens can become educated on environmental dangers such as the Burmese python.
