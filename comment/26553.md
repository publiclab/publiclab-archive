Hi, I would do the inline grids first -- the table-style ones, like `[notes:____]` and `[activities:_____]` and `[questions:_____]`. Then you'll be well situated to do a more complex one like maps. 

I would love to see some mockups, even wireframes (not too much detail) on how people would select the type of insert they want to make, and how they might input parameters like which type of content (i.e. which tag) they want it to display. For example, if the desired output Markdown is `[notes:water-quality]`, how do we best prompt them to select the `notes` type of display, and the tag `water-quality`? 

To this last question, perhaps a row of icons would work, and once you choose one, you could input text for the tag. In a later version, we might make that input auto-complete the tagnames, like on https://publiclab.org/tags:
