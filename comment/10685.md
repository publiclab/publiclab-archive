Nice work!  Looks like a clean and well-designed module.  
FYI, you can find some more open-source info at http://mobilesensingtechnology.com/ with some layouts for low-noise potentiostats, with integrated 18bit (mcp3424) ADCs that can be easily hacked and implemented in any arduino/raspberryPI/beagleboard, etc... environment.  I can't recall if files made it into the repo for download; but they are still publicly availabe upon request. Cheers!
