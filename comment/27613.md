[@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) "I do think there's a limit to how many pellets you can pick up in 10 minutes, so I also recorded the distance as a measure of density."

Do you have a datasheet you used for this activity you can share? What was your method for measuring the distance? UW COASST Marine Beach Debris Monitoring has a pacing measurement for example with instructions. 

And holy smokes! Thanks for sharing the Slater Museum at University of Puget Sound resource -- they're in my area! I didn't realize they're doing a Nurdle Project. Checking it out now.
