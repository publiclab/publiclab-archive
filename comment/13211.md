Thanks to Chris for some lucid suggestions. 
I have some questions, and ideas for improvements after reading your post.

Question: I don't understand why it is necessary to circulate the volume of all the room air every hour, if formaldehyde can be remediated with a bubbler/plant.
I'm wondering whether the flow of the room's volume of air every hour is enough
to create air currents that change things. 
Probably it doesn't matter in a house with cooking and vacuuming activities, as [@martenskram](/profile/martenskram) wrote.

Your point that the bubbler alone may be sufficient to mitigate dusts is something
that needs to be included. So a first experiment without the diatoms will improve the experiment.

In the interests of brevity, I didn't include all the information that I have. Silica dust has been well-documented outside the residence. I quote from part of the report: 
"There was indeed a presence of respirable (<4 um) and fine (<2.5 um) crystalline silica particles, as seen in a phase-contrast microscope analysis ..."
That is from a report from a local university laboratory.
Respirable silica dust outside gets inside.
Documenting silica indoors is important; at present, the best solution that I can think of is to measure dust indoors and outdoors.
I will measure dust quantities of all dusts, inside and out with the Dylos.
Concerning diatoms, part of this trial will be to see if diatoms will grow under artificial lighting. As diatoms do grow in indoor aquaria, I'm hopeful.
Fortunately, it is well-established in biology that silica is a necessary nutrient for diatoms.

Filtering air to the control aquarium and simultaneously using a bubbler could help add rigor. I'm not sure how to do that; presumably the intake air to the bubbler would need to be filtered first ?
My plan for now is to use a control aquarium at a site where there is less silica in the air.
Maybe the experiment at both sites should be repeated at both sites with a commercial HEPA air filter.
