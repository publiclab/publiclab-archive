iframe does work with SSL so long as both the site and the iframe site have proper SSL certs. iframes have had a number of security vulnerabilities in the past. For now, I'm not aware of any. Web browsers are getting less and less good at working with cross-site content. XSS (cross-site scripting) is a common vulnerability that browsers are learning to avoid. In some innocent cases, browser chooses to block the sites as "suspicious". I suspect cross-site content is not far away from having the same thing happening. Linked content isn't necessarily just DOM content, but JS can be tossed in anywhere. Once javascript appears in a linked iframe, the web browser developers are in a heaping world of worms from a can. In these cases, the browser developers try to support conservative, best-safety measures.

ultimately iframes are a hack to support what you want. They don't address the issue that is being raised, which is a trusted content distribution platform.
