The Arduino snow depth gauge seems to produce good data. It is an ESP8266 and laser rangefinder I2C sensor ($9 total cost). As expected data collected during the day is useless noise, but data collected at night is very good. There is still noise at night, but it limits precision by only about 1 cm.

The graph below records a two-day snow storm which increased snow depth by 20 cm. During the subsequent two days the snow pack settled and depth decreased.
