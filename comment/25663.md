Nice kit!

Main constructive feedback I would offer is that the cable that came ahead of the "Make" livestream event would have been hard to breadboard. I separated the wires (easy) and tinned them with some solder. That soldering step might be a barrier for some but made hookup *much* easier.

For a quick fun demo we've been lighting matches and candles and then blowing them out. It's surprising how long the area stays red/orange afterwards!
