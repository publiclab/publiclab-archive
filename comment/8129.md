Thanks Chris, I'll try to tick through your points, so the discussion is available for all.

Got it on E-bay for $9.99. Yes, I do have lots left for other conversions. As I cut it with scissors, trying to avoid fingerprints, I also realized I don't have a feel for how vulnerable the material is to scratches and handling problems. I'd be more comfortable with it mounted internally, to avoid handling scuffs.

Based on your experience with both, would you go with this Wratten 25 over the Schott glass filter you got us, to convert an A1200 with internal filter?

For a Rasberry Pi noir camera, I recall Mathew Lippincott posted a glue technique he's used. I need to check that. Some of the trimmed pieces may be large enough for that purpose.

How do you get the histogram you show? In PS, I see a number of other views, but not that one.

Another remedial question: Yes, I guess I just processed the Wratten image like an infrablue image using Ned's tool. What is the workflow you use to to use  the blue channel for NIR and red for red? Does it scale to a directory of images. I've had trouble, and see others have too, with PS actions on multiple images.

For infragram.org, I've missed some calls. Is an easy way to process Wratten 25 (SuperRed?) photos a topic under discussion?

Thanks for all your work in this area!
