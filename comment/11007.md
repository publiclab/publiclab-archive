Thanks Mathew,

The linearity in the sensor is a problem however it should be exponential so it can be removed. 

I am imagining the measurements of the standards done at the same time as the samples as everything will have changed since the last measurement including the battery voltage (therefore the LED intensity) and the temperature which will effect the sensors accuracy. Another option is to use an arduino to provide a steady voltage and a temperature sensor to adjust the resistor value.

The measurement of oil using LEDs is already done in industry so this should be relatively easy to implement I will give it a go when I get back into the lab.

I added the photo they have in this paper for the detection.

I have some more papers I will dig up that use LEDs as detectors as well.
