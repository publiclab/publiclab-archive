Hi Chris,

I'm not sure what you mean exactly by "finding a more elegant way to produce a KML file from this sort of data" but I expect GIS software would do the trick. QGIS is an open source GIS package and it can create a KML file from a CSV file (easy to create from a spreadsheet or fusion table) with coordinates and any attributes you want to tie to the coordinates. I'm happy to help with that if you want to give it a try. 

Did you get the data from the accelerometer too? An accelerometer doesn't actually give x, y, and z coordinates (at least not directly) but it can provide useful data for evaluation rig stability which is an application I hope to play with if I ever get around to building a pendulum.
