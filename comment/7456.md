Thanks for suffering through this. I just converted two A2200s, and they are quite straightforward compared to your experience. As far as I can see, there is not much difference between the A2200 and A2400 that would influence aerial or infrared photography: same sensor size and Digic 4 processor, and similar battery.  The A2400 has 16 MP instead of 14 MP, but I consider that to be a liability. The A2400 has 5x instead of 4x zoom, but that is mostly irrelevant (the widest focal length is the same). So the choice between the two is clear if you want to convert one.

I am curious about your plan to fly an unmodified and infrablue camera and sync the shutters. If you fly a pure infrared camera (Wratten 87 instead of infrablue) you will have a more pure NIR channel for making NDVI or NRG, although you would have to align the photos from the two cameras. Another way to get a pure NIR channel is to use a red filter (Wratten 25A) instead of blue. But I do not want to suggest that you take that camera apart again!
