The spectrum of most common halogen lamps is neither smooth nor flat and generally do not have published spectral data. You might consider the Solux 4700K (only the 4700K) which has relatively broad, and smooth, spectrum and has published data. The following links might be helpful: [https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/03-02-2015/plab-3-spectrometer-upgrade-prototype](https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/03-02-2015/plab-3-spectrometer-upgrade-prototype)  [https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/03-06-2015/plab-3-gain-correction](https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/03-06-2015/plab-3-gain-correction) . 

As for measuring petrochemicals, that is likely an extremely difficult task using only visible light. You might find the following links helpful.
