The BIG advantage of the Raspberry Pi is the use of the Sony IMX298 sensor whose spectral bandwidth is known and is 16 megapixel sensor. Much like the bandwidth of the solux 35003 light source bandwidth.
I am awaiting the arrival of a webcam which uses the Sony IMC179 sensor 8 megapixel camera. The current camera is capable of 8 megapixel resolution but only 640 are used.. The solution may be to upgrade SW to selectively switch camera resolution as needed.
I look forward to your success with the rasp Pi.
