Got some good feedback from [@maxliboiron](/profile/maxliboiron) from Newfoundland and http://civiclaboratory.nl --

> [@maxliboirox](/profile/maxliboirox): You can't. Not with any accuracy. A few folks have been working in this for years. Nothing yet (or maybe ever).

> [@maxliboirox](/profile/maxliboirox): [@publiclab](/profile/publiclab) Yep-- the microplastics CS project on zooniverse is about ID-ing plastics in photos. They know/outline the limitations pretty well (only large plastics, which accounts for only 7% of all marine plastics), films are hard to see, etc. They've been working in an algorithm to ID large plastics from drone footage, since the other limitation is the resolution and number of photos you'd need to make any count useful.
