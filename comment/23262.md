They're the same as the older paper spectrometer templates, yeah! But cut down a little more to fit nicely. You can find the outline to print here:

It looks like this:

We cut it down like this:

Does that make sense? but it's really just a black piece of paper that folds into a 1 inch square tube, pretty much.

Great question!
