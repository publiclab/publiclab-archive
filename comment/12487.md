New data: I posted about the [SkyShield at the KAP forum](http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/kap/discuss/index.php?p=/discussion/5585/skyshield-autokap-controller) and got two orders in 24 hours, *both for the solder-yourself kit!* So disregard everything I said above (as if you didn't already). I'm taking the evening off because I don't have to solder two PCBs tonight.
