This is a very informative proposal [@aliciapaz](/profile/aliciapaz), I hope you have submitted it or are planning to submit it in the final proposal for Outreachy on their website before the deadline on Monday 4pm UTC.

I love the tool you have shared to visualize the database, it's pretty good. I also like the in-depth research you have done in each section.

I haven't seen what kind of tests you plan on writing? Unit, feature, system? 

It is also good to think about what aspects of your tasks can be improved for user accessibility.

For mapping the tags using a checkbox, is there a reason a checkbox is better than say maybe a drop-down? Is a checkbox what is used on displaying sub-items in a list of items?

Also, this is something just to think about, for the deletion of tags by banned users, I like the method you have shared, but what about the ones already existing in the system, how can we address that?

Thank you, and all the best in your application!
