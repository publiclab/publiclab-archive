I created a directory in my root and put everything there, then opened Fiji and registered the plugins manually:
 
Plugins -> Install Plugin -> 'file'. 

The files are Photo_Monitoring.jar, metadata-extractor-2.6.2.jar, and xmpcore.jar.  I registered each separately. I guess someday I should figure out where the installer puts everything.
