Yes, [@gautami_gg](/profile/gautami_gg) and [@lekhidugtal](/profile/lekhidugtal) I had the same view.
But the original footer had such long sentences and in order to accommodate this, I found this the possible way.
Maybe we could think of adding some new content in the footer that is smaller in words and does not take a lot of space. 
We could reconsider the contents placed on the footer.

And regarding the fossasia open event project, the footer with height difference is not looking so good, according to me.
