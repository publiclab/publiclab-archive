Hi [@pdhixenbaugh](/profile/pdhixenbaugh) thanks for your question. In my basic understanding, you can 'place an order' for NOAA images and datasets through their data stewardship system. The specific NOAA satellites we are engaging with in the [#open-weather](/tag/open-weather) project (NOAA-15, NOAA-18 and NOAA-19) collect data through the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument. You can access data from the AVHRR on board NOAA-18, NOAA-19 and NOAA-15 and 'place an order' for your chosen dataset here: 
https://www.bou.class.noaa.gov/saa/products/search?datatype_family=AVHRR
Having never placed an order for these datasets I cannot speak to how they are sent to individuals nor whether there are limit to the amount of data one can 'order'. Hope this helps in a small way!
