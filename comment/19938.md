Ok, here is the averaging:

And here is where the image data is being extracted from the image file:

What do you think? We can try to reproduce this in a JavaScript test to see how it's affecting the output and if we're losing precision past where we should. 

Thanks for the careful look at this! Which spectrometer design are you using?
