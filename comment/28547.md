It's much more complicated than it seems.  It isn't whether something is sand or silica.  Because, by definition, they are the same thing.  Sand is made of silica.  

The question is what form are they in?  If they are in a crystalline form, they will cause damage when inhaled.  If they are in an amorphous form, a much higher amount can be inhaled with little damage.
