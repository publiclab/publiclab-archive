VOC just tells you the amount of volatile organic carbon, not the specific molecule.  If the voc is all octane, that's a totally different situation than if the voc is all benzene.

Then the question is how do you identify each individual voc?  The typical answer is chromatography.  But then the only way you can match is based on retention time.  There are situations where different molecules can elute at the same time.  Look at court cases, for examples.  So an extra form of identification is needed.  This form of ID is usually mass spectrometry(MS).

It doesn't mean all samples need to be run by MS, but if they need to hold up in court, MS is probably needed.
