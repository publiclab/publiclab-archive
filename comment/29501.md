Update for week fifteen- our last week for the semester until the spring! I am making some progress on my literature review, completed the modification of materials for my list, and am almost done working with coding for the Raspberry Pi and Arduino to regulate the lights in my prototype! I am planning on completing at least half of my literature review over the winter and am excited to dive back into my project again come spring! I will continue to work on planning for the construction of my prototype so that when the spring semester begins, I will be all set to jump right into building!
