Sorry, yes, the upper right is the solar panel. In relation to the battery needed I really don't know. As we turn it off for 57 minutes every hour, energy consumption is minimum and a 4000mah lipo is enough (or at least has been) during summer. 

There's a comparison of energy consumption in the following link. Says basically around 170mah watching at 1080p and 230mah recording at 1080p for a RPI zero W. I assume motion software is watching all the time and recording everytime an event triggers the camera so testing is mandatory ;D â†’ https://raspi.tv/2017/how-much-power-does-pi-zero-w-use
