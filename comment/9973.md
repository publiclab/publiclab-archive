if we're locking in alignment for the laser, and settling on mineral oil for a solvent, I don't actually think a container-less cuvette is a crazy idea.  I linked to a few expired patents on the issue in [@gaudi](/profile/gaudi)'s [nanodrop research note.](/notes/gaudi/04-03-2014/diy-micro-volume-spectrophotometer)

This one is just a cone with a hole in the bottom that holds a droplet:

this one makes the perpendicular orientation difficult, but its dead simple.  just a hole in a plate that is matched to the surface tension of the liquid.
