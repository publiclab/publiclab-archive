hi matthew: thanks for the tip -- we're trying out new kite designs as we find them online. the standard kite designs (the X frame or H frame) that the students use in Haquira, are the ones we started with - and the H frame has yeilded the best camera lift results so far. if you have other tips on design esp., they'd be welcome!
