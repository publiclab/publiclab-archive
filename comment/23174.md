What contaminants exactly you are talking about? There is photometer reagents for many different chemicals.
For example this shop has many different kinds you can look at.

In description there reads method that that reagent uses. Just google method and you will find articles about it.

I am going to test hydroponics water with reagents like these and spectrometer for nutrient level analysis when I have build my Lego spectrometer. I will share my experience later.

Here is example of using commercial colorimeter to measure aluminum concentration in water.

I hope this is helpful.
