 Hey Everyone,
This is Lekhika Dugtal.
I tried to create some designs which is possible to implement too. 
As being a designer and a developer, I usually came across easier designs than done on technical aspect. Its not that designing is easy , rather it needs a lot of work in thinking and analytical process. But A design which is possible to implement. Considering the timeline given to person for three months. 
I tried to keep it a simple as it is. And to make the UI user friendly.  
I didn't go for some out of reach fancy UIs.
Rather I tried to improve the design than redesigning it completely.

Considering the coding part, The code won't change much. Most of the work will be in css and html. The requests given are still the same. 

Main part would be toggle, where if clicked on one icon, one group of items will be displayed and others will be hidden. And vica versa for others.

The Rest of the part will be almost same as only css will be worked on.

Thanks a ton to those who gave it a read.

The suggestions are welcome whether its technical or design XD
