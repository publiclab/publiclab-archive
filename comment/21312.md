Hi, folks -- as you may know, we've accepted Cess to be our Outreachy intern this session (congratulations, Cess!). I wanted to write to thank everyone for their incredible work over the past several weeks. If we had the capacity, we would have loved to accept more people. Our community is growing and perhaps this will be possible in the future.

I want to wish everyone the best whether you were accepted for another project, or if you have other projects of your own coming up in your life, and to make sure you all know you are always welcome here in our community. You're all amazing and I'm confident you all have amazing things in store in the future!!

THANK YOU for everything!!! üéâ ‚ù§Ô∏è
