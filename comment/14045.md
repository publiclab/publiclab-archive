Hi, this sounds well thought out and is an exciting project. A student named Bittu did some research I linked to from the ideas page that indicated that modem.js might not be the same encoding as SoftModem. SoftModem is FSK, but modem.js seems to be something called Bell or something... Sorry, you'll have to look at the original email they sent. Just a heads up. 

I agree that while the low bitrate is something we could hope to improve on, it's plenty for polling a 0-255 value every second or so, which is probably a high data rate for many environmental sensors. So I agree that a slow initial implementation that works is a good first step, and speed later. 

Finally, as there are different encodings to think about, it's a good idea to think about developing this in a very modular way which could swap out modem.js for something else, for example. In general, this project might benefit from being broken into several smaller self-contained modules, too. 

Thanks for your proposal!
