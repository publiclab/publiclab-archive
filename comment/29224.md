I'm the plant I worked at,Zinc was an issue.  So for a long time, we were doing frequent sampling at a number of stormwater sites and frequent testing by AA.  After all issues were settled, testing became much less frequent and at only two sites.  It went to monthly and then to quarterly.  That's not to say zinc was the only issue.   There were spikes in things like oil and grease that led to much additional testing, as an example.  And other issues came up from time to time.  But the routine was, pull the sample with the isco, measure the pH, acidify, and send for testing.  The lab that did the testing had to be certified.  If it was an emergency where a problem had to be traced, we did the testing internally( i.e. Used it for tracing only).
