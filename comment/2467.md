Wow, brad, that looks great. With the paper ones, we've been making the upper and left edges rest against the side of the phone (for an iPhone). Maybe we could make a modified baseplate for the iPhone for people who want that. Have you taken images through it?

Indeed, Mfarmer, your design looks great. I'd also love to see a model!
