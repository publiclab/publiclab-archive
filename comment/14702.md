Well, it's been a week now since posting this proposal up and no responses except from Warren. Disappointing, so I am going to discuss some observations from pre-testing that I have already done on the 365nm LED and the 385nm LED from Mouser electronics. Number one is, from the picture above you can see the perspective size ratio looking at the penny in relation to the LED, this is a very difficult LED to work with, and its luminous intensity is insufficient to illuminate ANY sample at the appropriate right angle for fluorescence, even adjusting the LED flush with the sample cuvette will not produce the necessary illumination of the sample.

Since I haven't received any feedback on this proposal yet from the "community," I am strongly considering NOT using these two LEDs, and looking for an alternative. 

On the point of a "community," this is another interesting point of contention, a very interesting definition of this word is:  "an assemblage of interacting populations occupying a given area."
Notice the operand word; "interacting," if there is any real interacting, it certainly isn't here in this area of cyber-space. There just seems to be no leadership or real direction, I am a voracious reader, I appreciate and have a real love of learning and with that, entails a high degree of interactive feedback and personal interaction.

I'm just not really finding the same type of enthusiasm at all here, I always continue to post my research here but I'm not really going to expect much in the way of any feedback or interaction, so as far as this experimental proposal is concerned, it will get done whenever Jeff wants, I'm in no rush.
