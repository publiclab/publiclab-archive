I've a small sample size, n=1 flight!, with same kit using a 60 cu ft tank of balloon grade helium., not sure about the precise mix but pretty sure it wasn't 100% helium. We used the entire tank and it lifted  the camera and rig just fine, but not sure it would last for flying the next day. Our He source (Fiestaland!) was great, and offered to start our balloon in shop with about 10 cu ft of He when I was fretting that 60 cu ft wouldn't be enough. We didn't need it, but that may be another strategy if the tanks you find are small. Hope that helps
