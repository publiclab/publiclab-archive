I currently have 2 big MapKnitter feature requests that are not part of this proposal that I would like to just state for the record (not to distract from this proposal!) 

1)Masking or PNG/TIFF support for image overlays 

2)User controlled layer hierarchy 

Both of these feature requests are related in terms of giving MapKnitter users more power in making better maps. (1) allows users to remove unwanted parts of an image from a map (2) allows users to have their preferred arraignment of overlays for optimal map production
