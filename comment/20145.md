We've requested a sample of v4 and also placed an initial order! We're going to have these precut by a coroplast cutting service (that does political signs) -- a great idea [@mathew](/profile/mathew) came up with for another project (#aeropod). They do full color printing. But for sure it's great for the design file to be usable by people just printing it and, say, gluing it to cardboard or wood, or lasercutting it themselves. 

Thanks for the input, [@maggpi](/profile/maggpi)!!
