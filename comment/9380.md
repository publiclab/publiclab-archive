Let's try again. Gravimetric monitors capture particles and allow a weight of those captured to be determined. The distribution of aerodynamic diameters of the particles captured will depend upon the particulate in the air being sampled and the design of the monitor. I've seen an explanation of a 50% cutoff point of 2.5 microns as a particulate with aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 microns has a 50% probability of being captured. The probability of capture decreases as the aerodynamic diameter increases and the probability of capture increases as the aerodynamic diameter decreases. So a epa approved PM2.5 monitor output will be capable of including some particulate with aerodynamic diameter greater than 2.5 microns as well as less than 2.5 microns. The actual distribution will depend on what is in the air sampled. How any of this is actually determined and put into the design is beyond me, but it has to do with the design of the cyclone I believe.
