That looks good! To make the leg holes symmetrical, I've found the easiest way is to make a single hole and then mirror the "cut" command from the history bar at the bottom.

To make new versions of the KAPtery rigs, I started by importing the .stls into a blank workspace and using them as a guide to make sketches. This may not be the most efficient way, though, now that there is mesh editing in Fusion 360.

 I've tried it out a bit, and it's difficult to edit what's already there, (filleting, extruding, etc.) but it's easy to add features to it using sketches. I guess it really depends on the type of edits you're planning on making.

Glad to help,
