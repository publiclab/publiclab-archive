Thanks [@ajitmujumdar25999](/profile/ajitmujumdar25999), for this proposal! I'll leave some comments  just in a list:

- I like your thinking on infrastructure (like the spam dashboard) to manage and coordinate the community of translators + reviewers, and I totally appreciate that more of a 'system' would help! I wonder, though, if we could use the topic/group infrastructure of PublicLab.org itself rather than build a new dashboard. For example, https://publiclab.org/wiki/translation lists some activities, and we could think about recruiting people to follow the Translation /topic/ at https://publiclab.org/tag/translation to get involved. We could make the wiki page the "dashboard" perhaps? I'm just thinking about how to be judicious in creating new systems that would have to be maintained as well. 
- I love that you've mapped out the recruitment flows. It'll be great to think about where the "roadblocks" are and to ensure for example that people who don't have GitHub accounts are supported. You can see a bit of this happening already at https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/9481 but most translators/reviewers may not even be familiar with what GitHub is!
- safe_join is a very cool idea! I do notice that [it doesn't actually close stray HTML tags](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/OutputSafetyHelper.html#method-i-safe_join), but it definitely would escape them if they're not valid. That said, i agree it's a good short-term improvement that would make things fail a little more gracefully. 
- finally, i think a set of robust tests for inserting the helper icon and tooltip into different HTML scenarios would help us diagnose. We might have a test page with a variety of HTML content in it, which we attempt to run the translation helper on, and to write a test around this? At least so we can visually review how each scenario renders. This would also make it easier to confirm that a JS vs. a Ruby helper were both functioning as expected with a variety of challenges!

Thanks a lot, [@ajitmujumdar25999](/profile/ajitmujumdar25999) -- much appreciated!!!
