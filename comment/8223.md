Wow, super thanks Max! Just wanted to connect you with this recent post on stationary tethered monitoring: http://publiclab.org/notes/EdMallon/02-11-2014/an-arduino-based-underwater-sensor-platform

Also Scott E's very detailed post on needs of water monitoring nonprofits in Louisiana: http://publiclab.org/notes/eustatic/3-27-2012/thoughts-water-sensing-needs-non-profits-louisiana
