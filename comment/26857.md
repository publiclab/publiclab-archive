Brilliant!!! I wasn't there but know that picture! Ha small world! Gabi and I are good friends, we got chatting about aircraft transponders after a work meeting and discovered our mutual fascination with radio. [@sashae](/profile/sashae) and I have emailed Gabi to ask if, when she has the time, she would be up for contributing a guide on DIY antenna building. We are yet to build our own antenna! We had plans for a QFH but then coronavirus hit. Normally the project is unfunded so moves at a snail's pace but we've had a tiny bit of funding recently so have been on hyperdrive. [@sashae](/profile/sashae) and I are planning to join next Tuesday's open call. So, hopefully, speak then!
