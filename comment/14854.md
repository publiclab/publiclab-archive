Your suggestion is to continuously pan, and then increment the tilt? That is sensible.  One reason why we were doing a separate pan and tilt mechanism, however was the idea that instead of repositioning the camera within the rig, it would always point the same position in the rig, and we'd move the attachment point/pan mechanism hole-hog, and shooting for a narrow panorama, rather than a full sphere. 

The portrait mode is also a good solution, that is how [Jim Day's rig](/notes/mathew/06-03-2016/jim-day-s-picavet-rigging-on-my-saturn-v) worked most of the time.  he would detach the horizontal mounting L and mount directly to the verticla bracket:
