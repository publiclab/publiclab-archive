Hi all! Just circling back here to sync up a bit. Some new things exist! Some plans have evolved! Let's stay synced, esp. [@aashnaaashna](/profile/aashnaaashna) and [@MaggPi](/profile/MaggPi) !

Just a few to note:

* https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer-app exists! It's pretty interesting.
* https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter-exporter-sinatra exists too, and will be integrated following https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/issues/270

Any other updates people want to share? Thank you!
