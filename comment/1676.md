Hi Warren, sorry for posting so late but I tought my comment will not be published...:)

Your wobble is acceptable compared to mine: <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/100899132748014268592/Spectrometer?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCN3Y3a3YqefknwE&feat=directlink">some spectra</a>

I have found some info on this amateur astronomers site: <a href="http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/fringing/opus/index.html">CCD fringing 1</a> and <a href="http://www.astrosurf.com/lailly/spectro/fringes.html">CCD fringing 2</a>. I am afraid my problem resides in the CCD protective glass. That's it, the devil is in details, despite I am using the same ccd as some major spectrometer manufacturers.

Yes, I was thinking to make it open source despite my project is a commercial one. As soon I will sort out the annoying interference fringes and finish the firmware I will make it available. Anyhow it was way too much work for one person and improvements from third party is welcome. Saddly the other open source spectrometer projects are not available. I mean <a href="http://myspectral.com/">Spectruino</a> and <a href="http://www.openspectrometer.com/">openspectrometer</a>

Regarding total cost I am now at around 200 USD. Obviously electronics are the cheaper part, the CCD was 25USD, ADC and Chipkit board another 40USD I guess. The grating was expensive, 105USD from Edmund optics. First surface mirror and collimating/focusing lens was recovered from a scraped Minolta color copier. But I think one can get a good spectrometer and more important it gets access to the pure raw data from sensor unlike in webcams.
