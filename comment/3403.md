Martin -- this is truly fantastic!  Truly a huge leap for DIY Spectroscopy.

How often do you think you'll be able to take spectra of the same batch, over time?  Is it possible to set up your computer + spectrometer + sample so that you take a snapshot spectra every X minutes?  If you could do that for one sample and watch the spectra evolve over time in a sort of movie, it'd be truly spectacular -- and hugely relevant to many environmental-monitoring applications (water quality, etc) ...

Thanks for posting this!
