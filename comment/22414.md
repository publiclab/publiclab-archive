Airmetrics got to scratching their heads over this difference as well!  It turns out there is an additional variable that isn't listed in the manual but used to calculate Qcalc:  The pressure drop across the Laminar Flow Element calibrator that Airmetrics uses for their calibration. 

They discovered this by contacting the former employee who wrote their calibration software, and are going to do some more digging to help explain the calibration process more completely. Stay tuned...
