Wood moisture content is commonly measured at different points in the process of turning trees into finished wood products. Many wood moisture meters measure the electrical conductivity between two pins pushed into the surface of the wood. Others measure the magnetic field. 

Reflected light might tell you something about the surface of the wood, but not much about the moisture content of the wood under the surface.
