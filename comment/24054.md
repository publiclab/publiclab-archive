 OK testing this out now. Here's our sensor, on Cromwell St at our office: https://www.purpleair.com/map?582419|582421#13/41.81161/-71.41883

Note that I covered the fan, but not all the holes in it, but it should substantially reduce how it's able to detect stuff. But I could redo it if need be.

Now, after lighting a bit of paper on fire near it, it doesn't immediately flag the sensor:

Here's a picture of the tape over the fan vent:
