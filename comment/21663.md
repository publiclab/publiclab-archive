Thank you for your comment [@warren](/profile/warren) ! Actually from what I know Electron works well for desktop cross-platform development (Windows, Linux etc.), not mobile. With this mindset, what we're looking for is React Native, because it allows development for both Android and iOS using JavaScript (for both front end and back end) and has support for an offline first mode: when the user doesn't have access to internet, it stores updates locally. I believe it would be possible to implement a simplified version of the dashboard and wiki viewer for a GSoC project, perhaps with links to the web-app to access the other functionalities. I agree, working with many projects at the same time disperses effort and we have serious priorities. But sometimes it might be possible to conciliate, for example working on the Notifications API in such a way part of the functionality could be used for the notifications of the mobile app.
