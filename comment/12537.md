I see what you mean about the green channel being almost as bright as the red channel. The Rosco 2007 filter blocks almost as much green as red, so both of those channels are going to be dominated by NIR. A different white balance setting could darken the green channel some, but it is still going to include mostly information about NIR. The green channel does not have to enter into computations of NDVI, so it might not be so important. 

A more important issue might be that the blue channel is very dark. That provides very good separation between the VIS (blue) and NIR (red) channels so NDVI values will be plenty high. But the blue channel is so dark that most plant pixels and many other things have a similar brightness. This might be causing poor distinction between plants and non-plants in the NDVI values.

Many non-plant things (like the round bales and deck) have higher NDVI values than they should. Some of this is due to the nature of the blue filter which uses blue light for VIS and therefore does not allow [healthy foliage to be distinguished from some dead things](http://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/11-01-2013/why-a-red-filter-should-work-well-for-ndvi) (including wood and dead foliage). Some of the problem might also be due to the particular white balance setting -- the red and blue channels probably don't have to be so well separated.

You could try another white balance with another blue paper (in the shade under a blue sky) and see how it works. Or you could try a red filter which will generally provide better distinction between healthy foliage and things like wood and dead leaves. There are some advantages to using a blue filter, but only if the cutoffs are very steep on either side of red. The Rosco 2007 does not have very steep cutoffs.
