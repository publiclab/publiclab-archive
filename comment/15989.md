Please excuse this basic question but what makes you think that all such devices should calibrate with the same resistance? You've shown that for some similar resistances they do not give the same output.  There is variability that comes with inexpensive. It may well be the case that each such device must be calibrated individually, especially if you want your data to be trusted. I could not get the data links in your post to work (this may be due to my ignorance) but it is also important to convey just how you are going from particle counts to concentrations. This is not a simple process and margins of error may be such that two different device outputs may be statistically similar.
