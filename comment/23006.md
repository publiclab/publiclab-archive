Frequently, in agriculture, near infra-red (NIR) is used, often for grain ananysis.  One item is moisture.  They will change the amount the farmer is paid based on the moisture in the grain.  This is often determined by NIR.

So the first place you should start is with NIR.  

Now NIR can get pretty nasty with reflectance, then first derivative, and second derivative plots.  So be aware.
