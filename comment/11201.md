Another thing that confuses me a little bit more is this response from the people of Pix4d

Dear Andres,

We have checked the camera and filters you refer to and it seems that they are not adequate for NDVI. 
For NDVI the Red and Infra-Red bands are needed.

So, if you remove the IR filter from your camera, then you let IR wavelength light in the camera. 
However, IR and Red are captured in one Band and, so it is not possible to calculate NDVI.

Moreover, if you add the Wratten 24A RED, then you discard the Red values and if you add the Blue Rosco 2007, you get the IR but not the Red.

So, these filters are not adequate for your needs.
