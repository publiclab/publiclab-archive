Collecting you imagery so it coincides with Landsat 8 imagery is a good idea. MODIS acquires images at roughly the same time as Landsat so that's another good reference source for calibrating the Landsat and aerial images. Using a field spectrometer to calibrate you camera for reflectance measurements is also a good idea. I'm not sure how you could use the PLOTS spectrometer for that since it only provides relative measurements but maybe someone else has pointers. 

For the camera height the absolute height isn't as important as taking all of your photos from roughly the same altitudes above ground level. Geotagging your photos with a GPS is a good idea though. If you take a photo of your GPS receivers clock on the screen you can use a program like gPicSync (https://code.google.com/p/gpicsync/ to geotag your photos. 

When you go out and take photos I expect you'll make some new discoveries and will have additional questions. Feel free to post your questions to this forum or contact me via email.
