[@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) in a bit, lets get something working first ;-) 

[@warren](/profile/warren) A smartphone would definitely work for identifying silica! its just a matter of magnification.  The reason why I'm looking at a scanner is I want to capture a large enough area to determine the PM2.5 & PM10 concentration in the air, not just identify the small particles.  Perhaps a smartphone could be used to scan a sample...

There's an instructable about using laserpointer lenses to make a microscope out of a smartphone.  gotta try that soon! I have some cheap laser pointers around:
