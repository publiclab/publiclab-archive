well, B&H will sell it to you by the gallon.  pricey to try out.  $42-95 a gallon, but it sure will make a lot of targets.  I tried to get chips of the paint a few years ago, and couldn't at any local Rosco retailer. Rosco wouldn't send paint chips of it either :-(

We might be able to order it on a speculative budget and package up some small amounts for testing if enough people want to try it out and it looks promising.  I don't know enough to make that judgement.
