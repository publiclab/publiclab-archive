a confusion about the parts list on the line about the laser:

"or http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/350812684726?lpid=82 to buy just one cuvettes"

two things that could use clarification:  

1)  The laser pointer link is for 3 pointers of different colors, but you only need the 405nm, right?  The caps are optional but some people have expressed use for them. What about these links instead?  Bummer.  No animal gobos.  Sad face emoticon.

or if you want more caps:

2) did you mean "to buy just one laser pointer" instead of "to buy just one cuvettes"?
