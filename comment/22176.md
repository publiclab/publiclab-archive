 I think when i was updating my proposal , there was some error displayed "to correct bold heading , use * correctly , etc. " , but i clicked the submit button regardless and then the spinner kept loading without sending request to server . 

Now i am again not able to update my proposal .

Update : I am able to change the main image but not able to update content .
