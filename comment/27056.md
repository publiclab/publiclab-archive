It's quite a broad question to answer but when people use WebFire to estimate emissions, it's generally the best information _available_.  Sources could probably improve the data by hiring test companies to perform site specific tests and that would likely be more accurate, however that's not always practical for all sources, particularly for area sources, e.g. a lagoon, rock quarry, agricultural burning.  

Also note that the factors themselves are each rated A through E for reliability.
