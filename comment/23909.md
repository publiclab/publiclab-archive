Awesome work with survey [@liz](/profile/liz)!!!

Really liked the increase in diversity. Maybe we can increase the Outreachy slots next time, as I consider Outreachy as one of the reason?

> I have made minimal contributions to the projects and my experience was bitter sweet. Sweet because the maintainers are very responsive on emails and github conversations. It was bitter experience the fact that I couldn't connect with members of the community on IRC and so it sometimes feels like I'm sorry If this sounds offensive but for lack of a better word it felt like we're blackbox communicating to each other . Based on my past experiences, having face to face community meetings has proven to be a great source of my motivation to contribute to the team. I believe there's a likelihood that such meetings might exist but I am just not aware of them.

We need to discuss this one or maybe the idea we're brainstorming right now about monthly code calls is a right step towards creating an active and interactive community?
 
These responses https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/04-15-2019/report-2019-software-contributors-survey#Anything+else+you really made my day ðŸ˜ƒ. 

Thanks!
