[@Danbeavers](/profile/Danbeavers) If you ream it you're right-- I was thinking about just a drill hole and that note. Vibrations on either a cheap drill or a poorly secured work piece will introduce significant wobble in drill holes.

I really like the idea of a vacuum pump, but even with sensors watching the pump stroke, someone could still cheat or just miss on the process. I'd like any new hardware we introduce to make the process more fool proof.
