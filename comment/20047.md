The grating orientation might be the thing. I somehow didn't think about it before. I do have a laser pointer, and when I tried a few weeks ago, I was able to get something when pointed to the slit. It's just that "something" didn't look right. I think I have to check what about doing with that grating... I feel the "aha moment" is getting closer :D
