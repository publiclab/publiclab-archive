Well-commented code is always helpful. At the novice level at which I work, good comments are sometimes hard to come by. I have often stolen uncommented code from the internet that works perfectly and I have no idea what it does. 

One behavior to encourage is to include a URL for the libraries your sketch needs. People fork libraries all the time and often don't change the name. Some of my sketches use libraries which I would be hard-pressed to find again on the internet because there are several with the same name. Here is the library section of a sketch for the Nano Data Logger.
