I share co-working space with a bunch of the Mozilla guys working on MozillaOS (they just ditched the name Boot2Gecko), and their demo hardware is mighty impressive-- it looks like they'll have a foreign launch first, but next spring some time we should be able to start playing with their phones.  I hope they succeed because an html5 based system does sound like the bees knees.
