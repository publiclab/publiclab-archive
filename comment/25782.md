Love this. this is all perfect. Great short texts too. If folks are ready, we can start chopping this up into pieces for implementation.

One note - there are some tags which don't contain a colon (so aren't technically "power tags" which are for almost entirely utility use: `method` and `project` come to mind. Should we make a short list of those which should, like power tags, be pushed to the bottom of the list in the "grey" boxes?
