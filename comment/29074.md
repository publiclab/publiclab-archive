Thanks for the reply and willingness to answer my questions [@jesseslone](/profile/jesseslone)! I was wondering--did the DO and ORP readings end up correlating with bacterial growth?

We're dedicating some attention to wastewater monitoring methods right now at Public Lab (more on that effort [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/07-23-2021/reviewing-and-refreshing-the-topic-of-wastewater)), and any updates on how your sensor worked out would be fantastic. Thank you!
