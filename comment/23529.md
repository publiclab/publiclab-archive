Hi Divya

Footers can be large if we want and it's not necessary to compact the footer.   
Currently in your design the footer looks cluttered with lots of data.  
And we aren't able to differentiated between the contents  
How about we do some thinking regarding this . You know.   
What I want to say is ,   
How about looking through the footers given below -   
* wikipedia

* amazon

* flipcart

>And regarding the 4 column thing, the UI was looking a bit messy and there was a huge height difference between the columns making it look uneven, the way it is looking now. And also, another reason was that, there are big lines in the footer so if divided into 4 columns the lines would spread out to 3-4 lines which would (I guess) won't look very good.  

An opensource project called open-event of Fossasia? it has huge height difference.

The social icons looks very large in footer. 
And maybe we can work out again regarding the position of links ..

And 
> In this case, we can either add the dropdown menu or if there are less number of languages available, then we can just arrange it within a line (similar to Google)  
  
For language, google shows it in its main content rather than the footer. Maybe we can work out in this too. !!!

These are some of my opinions but we can have feedback from other to get better results and ideas.  

It will be great if experienced person can provide reviews to be honest.
