My IB French exam is Thus and Fri. Is is possible to set something up  Friday afternoon? 
I know you are looking for more details so  please read below. 

This post reviews GSOC first month activities and  goals/programs to be developed for the second month.

First month activities:

-Reviewed public lab/spectral workbench web site. – Have tried to review all sections related to  microscopes /spectrometry and multispectral imaging.  
-started building lego spectrometry, multispectral imaging – having trouble with consistent measurements.  Tried different designs to see what works best.   Working on adjustable camera mount for spectrometer.    
-prepared visible/IR table top camera  
-prepared several notes/questions, see:  https://publiclab.org/profile/MaggPi
-began learning spectral workbench calibration software
-purchased 2 raspberry pi 3B+/installed opencv. 
-setbacks-  New raspberry pi gave blinking light power supply error on start-up and had to be returned.  Damaged a pi camera while trying to mount in spectrometer.   
-established contact with mentors
-received public lab equipment 


Goals:

The second month  will develop a series of programs/functions that will adjust  cameral settings and display images with opencv.   The programs will be tested  with  imaging (microscope), multispectral and spectroscopic applications. 

-Programs will be based on the Raspberry Pi  visible, NoIR cameras.  This will permit controlling camera functions by picamera.   The general goal is to establish a two way link between the measurement, camera settings and computer vision analysis so the programs can be used for the next phase.

-Programs will be not be written for video analysis.  This will provide time for  Raspberry Pi to process opencv tasks at high resolution.  Video will be used for  camera set-up and spectrometer alignment.

Program Checklist:

Phase 1 tasks concentrate on  controlling and recording different camera settings.
-annotation of jpeg picture (time and file name) from pi camera
-collection of RAW image data from pi camera (this should provide 12 bit range, so far all I have been able to collect is 8 bit jpeg)
-annotation of  picture with camera settings (displays auto exposure settings)
-collect and process RGB or other split channel  images (for example: https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/05-14-2018/is-there-a-way-to-use-the-rgb-spectral-overlap-to-make-better-spectral-measurements)
-prepare routines for  side-by side display of multiple images (permits comparison)
-cycle routines that captures and display side by side annotated images at different camera settings

General Comments: 

Biggest challenge so far is working with opencv.  I worked with simplecv before and opencv is ---- not so simple.  One example is simple  tasks such as displaying side by side images often get errors. I know the opencv sidebyside command   is  hconcat but it only works if  the arrays are formatted the same size.   So this means you need to think how to scale all the images beforehand.   

Realize now that getting this stuff to behave isn’t easy.

Questions:
What type of format is required for the June 11 evaluation?  Is there some type of grading criteria like how many lines of code were written?
