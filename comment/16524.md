" how could we best show people who's nearby, and what projects they might be able to get involved in? How could we help people quantify and understand their own level of involvement and set of accomplishments? " 

These are some very powerful questions that you posted and it gives me a better sense of what Public Lab as an organization is trying to accomplish. I apologize in advance if I was little naive in my proposal I posted above. 

To be honest, I think the omniauth authentication would not take complete time for my GSOC project and I would like to do something creative and new also. I would reply to you after having a proper thought on a project apart from omniauth authentication. 

Thanks.
