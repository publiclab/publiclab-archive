Do NOT use standard, off the shelf strips, for food/drug applications.  There are special tracibility and accuracy requirements.  Normally, a couple of sweat words would follow here.  But hopefully, the idea got through.  Calibration can be a major issue in food/drug applications!

If you are referring to an earlier note, the test strips used for fish tanks were used on  suspected contaminated water samples as a way to reduce cost.  If there was an environmental concern, getting the EPA approved testing can be very expensive. If a problem showed up On the test strips, then the expensive test would be done.    That would lower the cost of samples needing the EPA testing. 

In industrial situations, this is not the typical approach taken.  Typically, the problem areas will be tested, per EPA methods(yes, the expensive ones). And when the issue stops showing up ( say heavy metals), the testing will become less frequent.  The time between tests may become even longer, but it is rarely eliminated.

Hope this helps.
