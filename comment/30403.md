Today we learned that the Clean Water Act o 1972 was authorized to protect people from consuming toxic chemicals in their drinking water. The current lawsuit conducted against Camp Lejeune states that Marine officials knowingly allowed residents of the camp to drink contaminated water. As many as one million Marines and their families were exposed to the carcinogenetic contaminates of the drinking water. Chemicals such as benzene, trichlorethylene, and perchloroethylene, to name a few, were in the water. Some of the types of cancer it can cause are liver, lung, ovarian, central nervous system, and esophageal cancer. Environmental Science includes the study of human health science which is relevant to the health of the human population based on our environment.
