In the code of the pi camera library, which is what many of the other libraries are built on, there is a special data export option called .array which allows for raw rgb data export as a numpy array. You can export this and a list of the metadata which is basically all the info you need for data processing. One limitation is it says you cannot export full frame photos in rgb as it results in an out of memory error since the files are so large, so you have to crop it or choose the extraction line first. You can however export full frame photos in the alternative YUV raw format, but that requires further processing on the PC end to turn it into RGB. I thought maybe cropping first and then having the pi send it over in smaller files would lead to a faster process.
