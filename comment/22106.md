 From a quick look, it seems that PAHs and PNAs (polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons) are the same thing.  We did PNA analysis on carbon black that was relatively sane.  It was a soxhlet extraction of the carbon black in a solvent.  The solvent sample was concentrated, and then a visible spectrum was run.  The PNAs have very distinct peaks.  

The soxhlet wouldn't be hard to set up.  The typical solvents are toluene, cyclohexane, etc.   Maybe there is another solvent that could be substituted.  Best to do it without concentration, first.  And, under a hood.  You get the idea where this is heading.

The expensive varieties of this test use instruments like a mass spec.  If the mass spec is required, it's out of reach.
