This isn't quite right dimensions, but proof of concept on the flared base allowing the block to register (with pressure from the bowed side walls) and on the lid being able to close with tapered sides allowing the flaps to get in. Might need to shorted the lid flaps a tiny bit to make it work together, but will have ot play with a better version built to dimension, not hacked together in 5 minutes.
