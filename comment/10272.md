Do you (or jack) mean getting the laser to be in the same place each time with relation to the slit? If the laser is fixed in place by the cardboard frame, I don't think it'll be hard to get it to align with the slit perfectly. I understood Jack to mean that the curved surface will deflect the laser, which a square-sided container wouldn't do. 

Have you checked the fluorescence of an empty gel cap after you found the paper about gelatin fluorescence?
