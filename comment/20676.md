Is there anyway the water temperature can be measured?  In one of these cases, the claim was that the DO was lower due to increased temperature.  That was the reason the fish died.

It would be an extra weapon in the arsonal.  

Can a sample be sent to a stateside lab for analysis?  Or are too many politics involved?  Thanks
