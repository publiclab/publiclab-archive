O.K. Here is the first bugaboo I come up with in using a tungsten lamp; the peak of the black-body curve is out of the range of the spectrum, so I can't use the spectrum like I thought I might to calculate the temperature of that lamp.  There seems to be a wide variation in temperatures for  tungsten lamps.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature gives a range of 2700-3300°K, and that jives with the kind of range I see after google search.

So, I guess that I am back to favoring the sun unless someone can come up with a specific bulb that is readily accessible and attains the same temperature through moderate changes in voltage and ac power frequency, or perhaps an automotive headlamp run at 12.5 V (approximate voltage of a fully charged battery).  I could do some experiments to see how much spectral variation  with voltage there is for a headlight bulb.
