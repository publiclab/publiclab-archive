Hi [@Warren](/profile/Warren), Thanks so much for the quick follow up. Here are photos of the unit fully plugged together, showing white after several minutes of warm up (was expecting green) and after corn starch particulate generation (was expecting red).

(I'm not sure if images are uploading after drag-and-drop.)

I would be VERY interested in a Plantronics/battery bar/SD card unit we could load on a drone (if the SD card portion were lighter than the battery bar, I'm sure this can work). We can certainly afford the cost you suggest.
