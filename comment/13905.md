Hey Dave, I got those cuvettes from researching the different properties and their function, but I understand what your saying about the narrow gap on the bottom of the acrylic one's. Does Plab sell them with the oil testing kits, because I didn't see them just by themselves in the plab store?

With the cuvettes I have now, there is no choice but straight ahead. I will try your suggestions, thanks.
