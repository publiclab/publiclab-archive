Tried drilling through bottle cap, then making the hole really jagged using an awl. Then a pen tube through a rubber stopper, thick layer of silicone sealant on outside. Pressed it snug, then backfilled on the inside and let it cure.

The fact that the silicone goes through the cap and flares on both sides makes it work, even though "technically" it doesn't adhere to this type of plastic.

Technically, you can't glue plywood with fiberglass , but it works in practice. And it looks like this method of passing wires out of a soda bottle works in a similar way.

This test was just with a pen with standard plug in it. Assuming it will work to pass wires through the tube and then backfill with more silicone. I'll try that next to make official, but just seeing if I could improvise something with what I had.

FYI, we got the lamp parts in the mail today, and they have a lead warning on them:

Possible we can source parts that don't contain lead, but something to consider in modelling a DIY solution that people might make from local hardware store, espec if we assume not everyone will go through the trouble to track down lead free version to throw in the creek.
