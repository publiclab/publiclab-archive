Here's another! I think once you enter a search term and search, I expect to be able to further refine the search by adding or removing words, especially in Boolean mode. But the search term no longer appears in the search box:

[![Screen_Shot_2018-10-29_at_6.19.12_PM.png](/i/27364)](/i/27364)

I think we could ensure the box remains filled, but also be sure it doesn't show the autocompletion, as that'd be redundant. 

This could be a good reason to have the in-page search (not the navbar) retain its own search input -- which doesn't have autocompletion, i guess? Or should it?
