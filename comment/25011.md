Hi! It's most likely your camera ribbon cable has become unseated somehow. It could be the longer ribbon or the tiny one on the camera board itself -- Did you buy a pre-assembled camera or did you assemble it? Either way, could you share a detailed photo or two of the camera board and the ribbon cable connections? We can help you debug!
