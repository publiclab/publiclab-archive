Hi Chris - I want to think about how we can help authors get higher visibility and, later, higher replication counts, and I think how posts show up in the grids is part of this. I also think the humorous titles are good though. I wonder if, instead of the added complexity of a subtitle field (which may be error prone, as you point out) we could just encourage a format like: "Main title: longer subtitle"? 

I definitely don't think we should dictate things. If we set things up right, and provide helpful info at the right times, suggestions will support people to write more clearly and invitingly (and with humor) rather than tamp down creativity.
