Hi! You should be able to find 3d printable models at [https://publiclab.org/lego](https://publiclab.org/lego), and potentially some other variants at [https://publiclab.org/spectrometry](https://publiclab.org/spectrometry) under "builds" i think? I'm sorry to hear of your health issues, best wishes and i hope this is what you're looking for.&nbsp;
