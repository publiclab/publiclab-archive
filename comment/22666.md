I think this is a great idea! P&C is great at running this sort of thing too. 

I was thinking maybe a cardboard microscope activity could be good, maybe, perhaps with the RPi already set up? Should we order some raspberry Pis and cameras to have around, and what other materials would be needed? 

Also maybe some bottles and 1m sticks for the "data logger on a stick" idea of a rain-proof way to put a data logger outside?

That last one is a nice one to prototype. 

Also [@bronwen](/profile/bronwen) - what do you think about ordering some very small (8-inch) mylar balloons and we could test making them aerodynamic with a fan?
