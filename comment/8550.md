In short, while you've clearly shown there is IR in all 3 channels, there is still a reasonably good signal/noise ratio difference between 2 channels, and that difference does seem to correlate with the presence of plants... even if it does so in the reverse of how NDVI works. That all channels are reasonably bright doesn't change the fact that there's a difference, it only reduces the amount of difference we can measure (dynamic range).
