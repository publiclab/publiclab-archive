Thanks Nick, The $9/month plan could work. It allows 20k checks per month, or one every 3 minutes which is more than we need. Multiple notification numbers is a plus. The free plan allows only 1000 checks per month, but your idea of offsetting the check times is a great hack. We could check the page once per day, but do it every 30 minutes from 3 PM to 7 PM with eight different "pages" or even eight different accounts.
