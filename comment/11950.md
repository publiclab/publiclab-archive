Warren, 
Agreed. The thermister changes temperature when it is in your mouth, or submerged in water, faster than in air, because water is a better thermal conductor than air. 
The point here is that under the best circumstances, the thermister is not a very fast sensor, and some applications may need to show changes in temperature more quickly. 
For example, if a Thermal Bob is being towed across a body of water, it may have a speed of 10 meters per minute, or one meter every six seconds. Since it takes 20 seconds to show a thirty degree change in temp, then in the six seconds that it takes to move the sensor one meter, you would miss most of the temperature change if the bob were to pass in front of a hot water vent.
