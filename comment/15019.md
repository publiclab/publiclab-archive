That UDEMY course is very good. I have been watching videos and making the models as he does. I think there is hope. I still can't make any useful changes to your last model of the leg bracket. Should I be able to modify the stp file of the bracket you put at Thingiverse? I haven't figured out how to do that. I'm just trying to make those last few changes.
