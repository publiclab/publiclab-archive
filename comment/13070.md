I'm working on creating a spreadsheet out of these equations.  [@Marlokeno](/profile/Marlokeno) it looks like I'm going to use Sutherland's gas law along with average temperature and pressure from local weather reports corresponding with the monitoring time.  Sutherland's Gas Law will generate Dynamic Viscosity and Kinematic Viscosity for a given temperature and pressure.
