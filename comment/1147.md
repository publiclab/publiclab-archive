I just updated my version of the 3D printable spectrometer: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28100

I changed the mounting angle to 32 degrees to more closely match the different gratings I have on hand. The 45 degree mount tends to throw the spectrum off to one side making it difficult to get a good photo.

In the end, while it does seem to work very well, the paper, PVC, or styrene versions will likely be more accessible to the majority of users. At least, until 3D printers become more popular.
