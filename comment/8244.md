Still working on it.  We made a revision to the detector which delayed us a bit.  We're shooting for early march to ship.  As a result, the beta sign ups are still open, so you can sign up here: http://photosynq.org/beta-test-application/ .  Then you'll receive an email to confirm your interest, and then we'll contact you once we're ready to ship.
