Here is a great reference document that helps parse out some different types of sampling for different study designs, depths of samples, etc. We could probably expand on its step-by-step instructions (e.g. Section 8.3.2 for surface soil sampling), but it gives a good overview of things to consider when wanting to do a soil study, and some good steps to do it: https://archive.epa.gov/region9/toxic/web/pdf/ee-soilsampling-sop-env-3-13.pdf
