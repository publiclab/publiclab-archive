Hi Roolark - Thanks for posting your comments and sharing your research. I don't know if you can post a link to  your thesis but I'd be interested in reading it. Your observations match what one would expect from the sensor transmission curves that have been posted. I like that you highlight the correlation behavior when observing different objects with high NIR reflectance. The odd thing is that in my limited experience the effect is significantly less than I expect that if should be based on the sensor/filter transmission curves. It's quite possible it's an illusion and some day soon the adverse effects could become more obvious. We will always have issues related to the very broad bandwidth of the camera channels but I expect they will still provide useful data. I hope you continue to report on your research.
