With or without participative avatars,  the production and maintenance of animated 3D  fly-thru bays or larger but semi-enclosed marine regions like the Gulf of Maine,  that can be populated close to real time with seasonal species and water quality mixes and abundances - past and present - would answer limitations in  the current delivery of  GIS data applied to nature and pollution. In this era, slideshow and other  linear presentations are unsatisfactory as the chief way of presenting data to non-scientists  like our political decisionmakers.   Instead, let's send them down and watch lobsters  migrate , let them see the flow of mercury coming down  Penobscot River and slowly entering the upper bay's surface sediments.. And all the good things too.  I think Marshall McLuhan would've agreed.
