If the nanite's output is 3V, then the voltage at your phone will be about 3V as well for the first few periods. But after a couple of periods the maximum voltage (=amplitude) will swing into the half of that. The third picture from kinasmith displays this behaviour very well.

I'm confident the ADC of your phone is robust enough, but I can not guarrantee that it will not break.
