Hi [@Cheesealmighty](/profile/Cheesealmighty), thanks for sharing about your work. While it's not spectrometry, there are a couple research notes on turbidity sensors by [@wmacfarl](/profile/wmacfarl) that might offer some additional ideas:

- [Testing of DF Robot Turbidity Sensor](https://publiclab.org/notes/wmacfarl/10-12-2019/testing-of-df-robot-turbidity-sensor)
- [Building the Simple Turbidity Sensor Prototype](https://publiclab.org/notes/wmacfarl/11-11-2019/building-the-simple-turbidity-sensor-prototype)
