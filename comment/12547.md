It's my understanding that the Dylos is the only monitor of those mentioned that is calibrated by its manufacturer. That implies that some comparison and adjustment is done to each Dylos so that within limits under the same conditions each one will give the same output. And presumably this is not just a question of correlation. I would wonder about checking one against the others before checking one against multiple samples of itself. I just looked at the article on using the PUWP monitors in China and each one was separately calibrated against a Dusttrak before being positioned. It would also be interesting to hear just what method you are going to use to make the comparisons.
