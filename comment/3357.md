Yes, now I have it.

When the entrance slit is rotated the rectangular spectral image turns into a parallelogram. It seems to get compressed vertically as well, which seems to mush the peaks together. The optimal viewing angle also changes, so you have to move your head to get a sharp view after the rotation. Here is a video of it in which the camera does not move, so it gets blurry when it rotates and stays blurry. I could have moved the camera to get a sharp view again, but it was hard to do. http://youtu.be/8NwtMSk8TLM
