Hi, Pablo - I think you can leave the DVD as it is, and the challenge will be to get it to remain in the same orientation with regard to the slit, very solidly, even though the cable comes out the back. The cable may be a problem because you won't be able to lay it against the angled wood block in the 3.0 design -- you may have to find a different way to support the camera, and that solid, unbending connection is very important to the calibration holding.
