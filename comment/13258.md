Ah yes, re: multiplicative. Luckily there's an as-yet hidden feature called `blend:` which is like subtract, but which allows any arithmetic combination of spectra; it runs a math expression on every pixel (kind of like on Infragram.org). So multiplication shouldn't be hard. The new `range:min-max` operation can limit our work to the necessary range, too.

Is it possible to upload the correction data here? What format is it in? If it's not possible to convert it to an image, I might be able to help do that, either manually in Javascript, or potentially we could reformat it as JSON or CSV data which we could build an importer for in Spectral Workbench. This is exciting!
