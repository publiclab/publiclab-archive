 I believe your first question was answered in general terms here: https://publiclab.org/questions/Ag8n/08-18-2018/pharmaceutical-class-100000-particulate-as-compared-to-pm2-5

I had short conversations with the sensor manufacturer reps in Beijing and Shenzhen and if I were you wouldn’t expect to find exact information. They may be commercially sensible and haven’t find any willing to go beyond what’s written on the spec sheet. 

Your second question was answered here: https://publiclab.org/notes/guolivar/01-08-2018/thoughts-on-low-cost-air-quality-sensors
