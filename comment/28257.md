Another option is a pack of three lasers marketed as kitty chase toys.  They run about $20.  Again, quality is an issue.  The colors are listed as red, green, and violet.  The run time for each, with AAA batteries, is listed as about 10 minutes.  One of the problems mentioned was  the violet laser was weak.  The lasers had the standard warning tag on them, which normally includes wavelength.  But from the picture, it wasn't clear if the warning label showed the wavelength.  Maybe a better description would.
