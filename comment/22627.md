Three of many examples of citizen science initiatives that, inter alia, have tested for pH in water are as follows: (1) "Exploring Experimentation in an Innovative Citizen Science Project" by
Ria Follett, Vladimir Strezov Ria Follett, Vladimir Strezov
Macquarie University NSW Australia "One of their research questions-
Did high pH levels affect plant growth?
Looked for existing sources of knowledge: e.g. popular
aquaponic sites recommend pH of 6.5 to 7 allow
update of nutrients (eg iron) by plants.
Collected data: 4 participants have pH >8, all other
participants had lower pH levels.
Looked to their own experience:
• “Most of my Kale is fine but some have yellowing
leaves “
• “my plants look healthy and my fish are thriving
so no problem”
Experimented with different pH level and found it
made no difference to their plants.
Concluded high pH is not a big problem"
