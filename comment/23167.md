I have very little experience with soil testing.  So the local extension agent was called.  He suggested the lamotte NPK test kits.  One that will do 50 tests and costs about $30.  He hadn't used it on hydroponics.  But at that cost, it's worth a try.  It's a visual test.  No instrumentation is needed.  By the way, amazon also lists a lamotte total test kit that will analyze for 14 different characteristics ( but only once), also for about $30.  Its also for soil, not hydroponics.  

Good luck
