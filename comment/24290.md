Hi, great post [@stevie](/profile/stevie)!

Here are some things which make check-ins successful:

1. Announcing in chatroom after opening check-in -- Sometimes, the contributor who open check-in forget to announce about the check-in the chatroom, which limits its reach, but as Sasha mentioned, we take care of that.

2. Theme matters 
3. Interactivity measure - After check-in is opened, it shouldn't be like a silent thread where people just write their goals but it should be a discussion about those goals/achievements. Whenever I get time, I reply to the questions on check-in or check out the links posted there. Many other members also support this.
4. Mentioning right people - We mention many contributors on check-in but it's about -- Did we mention all the new contributors, because, we want those new contributors to feel comfortable and welcoming and also to give them a feel of a community.

Ok, I got carried away with the community check-in part :P. 

I think the second model is great as it follows the modular approach. Breaking down a complex task makes it easier to solve. We encourage and practice modularity wherever possible. But, at the same time, having someone as a leader/mentor who could analyze the combined efforts or ensure that collaboration is working out well, is necessary.

So, yeah, it's somewhat similar to Sasha's proposal. And, if we want to improve the first model, then I would say having two people on a topic would be more appropriate as that way all the aspects like convening, trying all the related terms, etc.  can be easily handled as collaboration makes the task easier and fast due to engagement, discussions, idea brainstorming.

Following the note and will chime-in when more ideas strike me ðŸ˜ƒ. Thanks!
