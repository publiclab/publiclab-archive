Of you are using windows, start with SDR#.  It's freeware.  Start by listening to air traffic control in the local area.  The new versions of SDR# include ADSB.  IThat would be the next step.  The Reddit rtlsdr is a good reference. I've been able to easily track planes from 150 miles with The included antenna.

  The final step is the UAT.
