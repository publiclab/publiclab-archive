[@liz](/profile/liz) Well there is an upvoting system for question and answer as you can see in a question show page. See this link https://publiclab.org/questions/skoci/07-27-2016/question-joining. 

You can like an answer. Liking an answer also gives email notifications for the discussions in that answer. Liking an answer just supports the goodness of the answer and reflects how many people actually think that the answer is a correct answer to the question. It is in no way related to accepting an answer.

An answer can only be accepted by the question author. Accepting an answer shows whether the answer is the correct response to the question according to the one who posted the question.

So likes to an answer basically shows what other people think about the answer whereas accepting the answer shows whether the answer is the right one for the one who posted the question.
