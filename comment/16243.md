  Thank-you for getting back to me regarding this subject and your thoughts on it. I think that any data that approximates the quantity of sand ( in tonnage or some other practical measure ) that is being removed above and beneath the surface of the mining site is really what groups like ourselves (and FracTracker Alliance) are striving to somehow obtain. Apparently NOBODY knows this information or it's nearly impossible to get...Privately held companies must feel that it is too sensitive of a subject to allow access to.
  If you can think of anything, it would be appreciated. And like I said, I'd be happy to help in any way that I am capable.
  Thanks again!
