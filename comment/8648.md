Jeff, re: "...scale to live capture...". I'll have to guess that you mean observing spectral responses over time with the idea of generating a 'waterfall' plot. Assuming that to do enough analysis on a spectral band to get useful data (as opposed to just looking at a single line of pixels and hoping 1) it isn't saturated and 2) that there are no other anomalies) then yes -- though there would likely be a tradeoff -- slower but more accurate data vs faster but questionable data. Bad data is, well, bad data so let the data points be at a lower rate if necessary.

In simple devices (i.e. PLab webcam designs) accurate exposure control is questionable at this point -- and the original webcam just runs 'open' at max gain so at least it's noisy but 'stable'.

Yes, I think we should, at least for now, just assume the image data is linear with intensity.

I found it difficult to obtain enough image clarity of stepped or multiple slits within the confines of the optics-less PLab system. That's when I discovered that just having an attenuation range over the spectral band is easier to extract data than attempting to create artificial steps of "known" intensity which are accurate enough to rely on the designed attenuation values. (In fact, I failed to find a way to actually create such clearly defined steps in a spectral image (so as to be recognizable within the image) and was left with only creating a 'range' of intensity values. I do not presently see how to create accurate 'steps' but it is much easier to just measure what you get and let the software calculate the result from that -- i.e., like with HDR2.

As for curvature in the spectral lines. I found it difficult to generate such artifacts though I've seen some posted. I used some posted images to generate artificial images to analyze and found I could program detection and correction from using well-defined peaks to "follow" within the full spectral band within the image. I'd suggest that this could be a "selectable feature" that might only be necessary under "poor conditions". Well build devices shouldn't have curved spectral bands I'd think.

Cheers, Dave
