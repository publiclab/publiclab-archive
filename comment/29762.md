My experiences collecting microplastics along the Mississippi River were different than expected. I thought it was going to be a much more fluent process and easier to dip the BabyLegs in the water. However, we had to maneuver it along the surface of the water to collect microplastics. Also, microplastics weren't as visible as I thought. I saw water bottles and aluminum cans the most. The bottles could take between 20-500 years to disintegrate, while the aluminum cans could take between 200-500 years to degrade. Communities are affected by polluted waterways because of the use of the water and the resources it provides. If the waterways are contaminated with plastics and other pollutants, the water is not as safe to drink. These pollutant carry diseases, hazards, and large pieces of plastics that lead to health issues. We consume water from these waterways so it can affect us (long-term).
