Hi Jack, thanks for your helpful thoughts. We had been thinking through lab experiments like the ones you describe see these notes:

We got the equipment set up but were held up on the cost of H2S and our lack of knowledge about how to safely make H2S. You sound like you've got some experience with this? I don't suppose you'd be interested or able to pursue some lab work on this topic?
