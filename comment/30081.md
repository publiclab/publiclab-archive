Hello [@warren](/profile/warren) , thank you for your feedback! 

With regards to the slideshow on the main page, I think that feature could be added at the very end of the Outreachy Internship period, as you mention that it would require working with the PublicLab.org code and experimenting. I like the idea of having a featured image, and in fact the image picked could be one that is the most viewed or reacted to by the community as a way to give a spotlight on contributors in the community.

As for gallery pagination, I was under the assumption that the site fetched the images from Public Labs and then was put on the page instead of an Iframe embed. I see that my plan is a bit difficult given those circumstances, but I do still think that the gallery should be moved to it's own page, as the embeds in different sections of the site is distracting. For now, I think it should be embedded on its own page.

I do like the concept of a responsive layout! You are right, the whitespace isn't necessary. However, I don't think that the Infragram photo processor would necessarily benefit from the same design and set up as Photopea. Photopea is set up so that there is enough space for the multitudes of tools and file settings a digital artist will need. Infragram only has 5 major functions a user would use: Upload, Settings, Run, Share, and Download. The upload tool can be represented by the drag and drop window, settings can be compartmentalized in the preset and settings modals or dropdowns, Share (or the save button on Infragram) directs the user to the Public Labs site, Run can be a button, and Download downloads the image to the user's computer, so there's plenty of room on the page to put three or four buttons along with the drag and drop window. 

Here is a reworked upload page that takes into account the wider photo size on the page as well as reducing the amount of white space on the page. The modals will still open up when the corresponding button is pressed just like the previous design.

An alternative to that design can be one where instead of modals, there's a dropdown that extends to the right with the correct information/forms or a small window shows up with the respective information/forms. Here is a mockup down below.

Lastly, for the original image and opening it in a sandbox, I think a solution would be to require the user to upload the original image along with the processed one. Another way would be to allow the user to upload or not with the processed image. Definitely something to think through, thanks for bringing that up!
