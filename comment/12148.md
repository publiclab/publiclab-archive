Hi Warren,
Thanks.
I am a chemical engineer who always worked in Medical and Safety industries. Currently I am looking for a new position anywhere on earth as long as it is in a green industry or education. 
Anyway since a few years we are living in France, and I regularly get annoyed by the completely biased french press, especially with regards to nuclear industry and diesel cars.
So I started to browse around at open source websites for monitoring information. Public lab is doing great work. I made my own spectrometer, a bit different, when the tests are finished I will publish.
A PCR test is probably the next item I will tackle.
Best,
Boris
