Hi, I am glad that there are others testing out these sensors with a skeptical attitude.  Very often, the abosulute baseline readings from many cheap sensors should not be trusted.  Expensive instruments have all sorts of compensating analog signal conditioning circuitry and calibration trimmers that have to be tuned in a lab - thus driving costs up.  Discount sensor companies cut all sorts of corners in design and manufacturing and often lie about the real world performance.  I prefer to look at relative values and time change since they are usually more trustworthy.  Also, simultaneous recording temperature and humidty can give you extra clues to understand the response of the CO2 sensor.  And, believe me, the situation with the MOX CO2 sensors is much worse - since the sensor itself is the major source of error.

The SainSmart board is a drop-in module for many types of control systems and is unecessarily complicated, containing its own MCU.  I do think that the underlying NDIR unit (metallic module)  is sound, but it needs a better interface.  I am making plans to see if the particular optical sensor can be obtained cheaply and designed into an open source module which is easier to calibrate and integrate into extensible sensor platforms.  Again, it is important to lower one's expectations for the veracity of DIY sensor systems and to put things to the test!
