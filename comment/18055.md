Wow, this is really cool. I'm thinking about how to break out some of this info into a low-power-data-logging section or something. Would it be helpful to have a Questions section for low power applications?

I especially like how this kind of modularizes the problem of power management. Instead of writing code, you kind of wrap the whole system in a timer.
