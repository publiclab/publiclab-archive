<font face="Calibri"><p dir="ltr">Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; The problem is in the midwest/great lakes area.&nbsp; This is fresh water.&nbsp; For whatever reason, there has been an overly high level of fertilizer work it's way into the waste stream (usually in the form of N and P ) which has led to algae showing up in lake erie, some of the state parks, and probably a lot of private ponds.&nbsp; </p>
<p dir="ltr">So, there has been legislation passed on when fertilization can be done, etc.&nbsp; It has been somewhat effective. I am doubtful about the long-term chances of success.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So if algae is going to grow anyway, why not choose a proper algae and put it to good use? A check of the literature shows oil( including food oil), biodiesel, ethanol, biobutanol, etc.&nbsp; This looks to be in the distant future, but best to start on it now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thank you.</p>

Hi [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) - interesting! I know that folks have used IR cameras and NDVI imaging to identify algae blooms using aerial photography, but I have to admit I don't know a whole lot about the processes used to convert algae into oils-- my understanding is that processes are designed around particular kinds of algae, which are fine-tuned in a lab. We've started being able to ID algae with the community microscope, so it would be interesting to see if there is a way to combine the microscope and NDVI imaging to come up with a rubric for identifying particular kinds of algae blooms from a distance.  Are you asking about the possibility of farming (sourcing?) from algae in the oceans for energy production as a means to help scale back harmful blooms? Either at a commercial scale, or something that could be DIY'd? Would be interested to hear a little more about what you're thinking!
