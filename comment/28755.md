[@seankmcginnis](/profile/seankmcginnis) [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) I spent some time combing through the instrument manuals just now to answer your questions. Besides setting the instruments in their calibration stations (which double as data transfer centers), the only way to transmit data from the instruments is via an old-fashioned IrDA device. 

The instruments can transmit data via: IrDA and via the proprietary calibration station. The manufacturer of the devices has their own software and exports AQ data to an excel sheet.

To clarify my original question, _I think_ I am looking for a GPS device that can record multiple locations with a time stamp to be retrieved later.  (Our monitors are set to record pollutant levels every 10 seconds). After a week of data collection, we can correlate the data from the GPS devices with the readouts from the air monitors, provided the times are synced. I believe some older geo-caching GPS devices do this. Most of the Garmin devices have color displays and stored maps, which is far more than what we need. We are familiar with the terrain and location, we just need exact GPS locations so that we can map ambient AQ levels.

Simply put, we need to know when and where the handheld devices recorded an AQ reading and we cannot rely on our cellphone's GPS because we do not get cell reception in the field. Does that make sense?

One quick edit: we are currently using an iPhone app, _GPS Kit_ to get our coordinates when we are offline. It is clunky and I am looking to find a simpler solution.
