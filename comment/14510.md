excellent article Chris.
based on your experience you can advise us some targets already spectrally characterized, so we can finally start using the MAPIR in a rigorous and scientific mode.
Also you suggest that we can use the spectrometer of PublicLab (with some upgrades): what is it specifically ?? could you give us some additional indication ??
Thanks so much
