Hi [@wajeehamushtaq1](/profile/wajeehamushtaq1) thanks for your proposal!! 

One thought i had was i think this may be new-ish but you can directly test routes with these assertions now in Rails: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#testing-routes

Another is, i like the idea of the resolution selection using ImageCapture but, would that mean not getting live video? Maybe it's worth it even so. Would you try a different interface that's not based on live video, and would you do this in parallel to the existing live version? How might the UI or design change to accommodate this other way of capturing an image? These are also good questions for [@pzgeorjane](/profile/pzgeorjane) who is looking at the same API. Interested to hear your thoughts on this! 

Thanks for a great proposal!
