cfastie Great, in that case the formula that I'm  using is correct for the Weatten25A or for the Yellow filter

ndiv= (ndiv.b-ndiv.r)/(ndiv.b+ndiv.r) 

But what about the white balance ? how should I do it with the A2300 ? I just tested the 4 different pre seted white balances and I did a white balance with the Red filter over a white paper... It should be a red paper ?

Here are the 4 results of the pictures and a RGB picture

I don't seem to find any good result,,, 

EDIT

Well, this is something... this is the last image, the one i did a white balance over a white paper
