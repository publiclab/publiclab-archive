A quick googling for "bayesian spam filter ruby" brought up some interesting possibilities.

This article (http://rurounijones.github.io/blog/2014/08/11/bayesian-filter-performance-in-ruby/) is probably a good place to start, and he even has the Ruby code up on GitHub to start from.

Since the performance that PublicLab would need would probably be a lot less than 1000 submissions/second, it's probably a great place to start.  Also, the existing database of comments, questions, and articles would be a good starting point for training the filter.
