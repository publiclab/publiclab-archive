Invasive species affect our environment and have a big impact on it. This happens because once your introduced to something new everything that its use to changes. In most situations they become and threat and reproduce faster. When you look at a graph chart and try to compare the prey rates from then to now you'll see the difference. Invasive species have the ability to change a lot of things including, reducing biodiversity, extinctions of native plants and animals, and competing with the native things for that resources, and changing habitats.
     Invasive species can also change the food web in an ecosystem by destroying our food sources. They have more negative impacts than positive impacts. Invasive species really mess up everything. Sometimes it be hard to adapt once the invasive species start reproducing. In conclusion, invasive species has a tremendous affect.
