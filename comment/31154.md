This is a little strange.  In most fields, color analysis is usually done with an instrument called a hunter colorimeter.  Some of the instruments are now full spectrophotometers.  The instruments are calibrated to look at colors the way the eye sees it, so scientific comparison of color is valid.  Needless to day, the instruments are significantly different from these instruments.  And usually more costly, as well.  Is there any a reason, besides cost( which is a very good reason), why the alternate method was chosen?
