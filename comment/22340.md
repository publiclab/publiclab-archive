There is no iPhone app, or any app, actually! To capture a spectrum with iPhone, use your camera to take a still picture of the spectra and then upload it to spectralworkbench.org. 
On Android, use Firefox mobile browser to browse to spectralworkbench.org, login with your publiclab.org credentials, and use the interface's capture interface directly.
