      Many animals are close to being extinct. It could be because of pollution, hunting, humans, and invasive species. An invasive species is an organism that causes ecological or economic harm in a new environment where it is not native. The Burmese Python is an invasive species in the South of the United States. A group of them were released into the everglades thanks to a breeding facility not needing them anymore. These snakes took over as the apex predator. That made the alligator population decrease significantly because the pythons kept taking the biome's resources from native species. 
         The alligators aren't the only ones affected. It's all the animals in the community. The Burmese Pythons kept increasing and increasing, while the rest of the other animals decreased. They consume wood storks, Key Largo woodrats, and limpkins, as well as large animals such as alligators, white-tailed deer, and bobcats. They don't compete for anything because they are the strongest and will just take it.
