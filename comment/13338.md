I've had an idea of a rig made from a chinese togo container and chopsticks for a while. I made one, but the container was not robust enough at the base, and the legs ripped through too easily. but the container did make a nice cradle for the camera in the cardboard rig above.

I just tucked the camera into the box, then finessed it into the rig. It really held the camera in a great way, protecting it on all its edges, but keeping it firmly in place. You could still peek into the top to inspect the screen and make sure things were happening, such as your CHDK script running, etc. Alhtough you would have to pull it out of the harness tofuss with it.

But all in all, the chopsticks worked, although they would break for sure with drops like this. But they come at the exact length and are super-readily available.

Here's another test, with a little flavor context shot, captured on a Mobius with 6mm lens, btw.

I know, the lens isn't protruding, but was testing before exposing the camera to damage.
Thoughts?
