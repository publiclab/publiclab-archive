Camera orientation and position (relative to the photo scene) is reconstructed when a structure-from-motion model is made using lots of photos taken from multiple angles. This model would have to be georeferenced so it knew which way was north. Then you could assign a sun angle to each pixel in each photo.  Unfortunately, the sun was not out consistently during this balloon photography session, so photos vary a lot in in how much sun reflections are an issue. The photos also vary a lot in how much they were illuminated by direct sun, cloudy sky, and blue sky, so color balance is inconsistent among photos.  I guess it is not so surprising that color alone does not distinguish Trapa well. The second GIF above suffers a lot from direct sun reflections, but it is one of the nicer photos of Trapa. 

A crude index of specularity could be generated if compass orientation was determined for each photo and we assumed the camera was pointed vertically each time. I'm not sure how helpful that would be.
