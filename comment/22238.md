[@falbriard](/profile/falbriard) [@jjcreedon](/profile/jjcreedon) thank you for the info! Can you join us for a brainstorm about soil testing at the Upcoming OpenHour? 

Date: Monday, April 1st
Time: 6pm London / 1pm NYC / 12pm New Orleans

Soil testing through professional labs can be expensive. While there are more affordable options such as XRF and other field test kits, most are still out of community’s price range or aren’t widely available. DIY and open source soil testing methods and technology need further development.

    Are you interested in low cost soil testing?
    Are you concerned about heavy metals, organic chemicals, or other soil contaminants?
    Have you explored colorimetry, reagents, spectrometry, microbial, or other approaches to analyzing soils?

Come to share and brainstorm open-source, DIY methods for soil testing. We'll spend time discuss pathways forward for soil testing that are more accessible, and meet others working on this!
