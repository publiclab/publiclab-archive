There are tradeoffs, but it's certainly worth trying violet/UV LEDs. The wavelengths are roughly equivalent, but the LED emits across a broader range of wavelengths than the laser. It's easy to measure that with the spectrometer. 

Lasers produce smaller focal spots, so they can concentrate light on a tiny sample or detect lower concentrations of pollutants. But their more directional light is more of an eye hazard. 

The violet LED flashlight may emit more light overall from a broader area, but I have not measured the actual power so I'm not sure. Like a standard white LED flashlight, it emits from an array of LEDs, so it might not make a smaller device. 

Just checked ebay, and  packages of 100 ultraviolet LEDs are on sale for $5-$10. No details on the packaging, but I would guess it's a couple of bare wires and a lens, and that price is so cheap they could be designed into a spectrometer.
