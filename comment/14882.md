That's a good point, Chris, and I like that you start at the camera.   

Beyond framing kite photography, I think it's worth integrating several of the photography techniques we've got proposed, starting from "so, you want to monitor a landscape?" People are using web-mapping and imagery products, cell phone photos, timelapse, trap cams, pole photos, kite photos, balloon photos, airplane photos, passenger get photos...  a high level landing page would be useful. 

####Deciding what types of photos to get.
Is a landscape view needed to show scale or impact, or is some physical factor being measured from photo to photo, i.e. murky water, or the changing shape and size of a waste pile?

How often are photos needed?

* Are photos needed to capture a fleeting, infrequent event like runoff? Continuous monitoring is probably the best option, see timelapse.
* Is an occasional check-in or one-time photo needed? Site visits may work best if the site is accessible

is flight needed?	

* Can the subject be seen from ground-level?
* do people pass by regularly? Phone images may work.
* can a time-lapse camera be placed nearby? See time-lapse options.
* can images be captured from a nearby building/high point?
* can the images be captured with a pole (10M or less)
* is the site accessible, or are the flying areas far from the site? see picking a flying site.

if the site is not accessible

* can oblique images from a distant point work?
* can a kite be placed nearby? see can the kite get to the target site.

If flight is needed

* What angle are the photos needed at?
* Can a balloon be flown from the site?
* Can the kite get to the target site?
