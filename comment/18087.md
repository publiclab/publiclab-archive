One of the links on the page was for an aotf nir spectrophotometer.  Part of this instrument was a vco that could be tuned from 75 mhz to 120 mhz.  Although it would require other changes to the system, if the vco was tuned to the center freq  and a sine wave fed to the vco thru a high q  circuit, it could be a fft instrument.  How far off an I?  73
