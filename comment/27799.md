[@ruthnwaiganjo](/profile/ruthnwaiganjo) - welcome! Really glad to have you join the Public Lab community and as an Outreachy intern. It's great to learn more about your path into technology & programming, expanding your knowledge about open source, and sharing this delicious Ugali dish! Yum!

If you are available - Public Lab's next event is happening this week! Read more here: https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/11-23-2020/what-s-in-your-airea-public-lab-virtual-event-on-air-quality-monitoring

For fun: I recently learned about Sombe (Cassava Leaf Sauce) recipe from Democratic Republic of Congo through a new cookbook I ordered called Berbere & Beets - Recipes from Alaska's Refugee Community. I hope to make it this winter to try for my first time!
