Hi Katie! we'd be happy to make you a repository for these. See some example here:
  

[https://github.com/publiclab/community-microscope](https://github.com/publiclab/community-microscope)  

[https://github.com/publiclab/papercraft-spectrometer/](https://github.com/publiclab/papercraft-spectrometer/)  

  

if that's the route you want to go!

I'd like to post plans for this project on Github, as well as OSHWA, but I'm not sure how best to affiliate them with Public Lab. For github specifically, is there a way to tag or link projects to Public Lab, or should I just post under my own account and reference in a link? I'm not quite to the point of posting anything yet, just scoping out the territory.
