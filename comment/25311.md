This is really interesting information. a few questions:
1- love the schematic of the lead concentrations in various food crops. What levels are considered "safe" ? I realize it depends on bioavailability too. 
2- where do you get these zinc test kits? I understand , good for heavy metals, but potentially there are so many other toxins in soil.. depends on application- as you have stated in your article.
