Hi Vman what happened to me was that chrome doesn't even work with the front camera using iphone. Unfortunately It doesn't support WebRTC so it is impossible to use the Spectral Workbench with the iphone unless... you take the pictures  first, using the phone rear camera (more definition) and further uploading them to the Workbench.
