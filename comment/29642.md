The acid (from the pH 3 solution ) for the cabbage indicator could mess up some titrations.  A blank might need run(and, depending on the titration, the blank could be substantial). A better approach might be freezing the indicator.  Then adding the frozen indicator to the flask and letting it melt before titrating.  Freezing was mentioned in one of the first comments on compound chem's page.  But I've never tried it.
