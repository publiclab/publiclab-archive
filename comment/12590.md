Juan Pablo Torrente has made several maps out of balloon and kite mapping https://sketchfab.com/bajaltura.com
They are amazing 3D maps, like this one from Las MÃ©dulas in Spain https://sketchfab.com/models/88bb7c08a8104650ae3f3ed3b026e882 He made for us this 3D map of a square in Barcelona.

A commercial tool like PhotoScan can be used. It is a good opportunity to ask if people are using any open source software for post processing 2D images into 3D.

The software needs a good amount of photos from different angles and positions to be able to generate the 3D object out of all the 2D images.
