I actually usually use default webcam settings! So going back to the original question, I believe there may be an issue with the angle or the orientation of the DVD... sorry, it's getting quite difficult to follow all the threads on this page --

You had a perfect image, so I don't believe there is a problem with the camera itself. 

But I don't see any spectra even in that image, where we should. Can you upload a new picture similar to this one but clearly showing the DVD orientation?
