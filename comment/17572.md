Thanks Jeff! There is also a need to coordinate this survey with the other surveys that are sent around Public Lab, such as other _post-experience surveys_ like we distribute after events, and other _annual community surveys_ such as the ones that are distributed to the entire community and to the organizers group. These surveys have all been designed to track progress against Public Lab's logic model, just about finalized with support from University of California Davis' Center for Community and Citizen Science. A software contributor survey will also need to line up with our logic model so that we can track if we are making progress toward our short, medium, and long term outcomes.
