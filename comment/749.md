Just want to remember this idea: small good-sized first-surface mirrors can be found in scanners, and I'm planning to take one apart to get them out. One reason the above test didn't work well was because I didn't have good quality mirrors. First surface mirrors would be especially good because they have no glass in the beam path -- they're just bare silvered surfaces.
