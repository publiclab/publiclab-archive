The only kit I see for sale is the Lego kit? I do not see them selling a v3.0 kit?

I plan to make my own case (Have CNC mill, laser cutter, Resin and FDM 3D printers)

I have already ordered a different webcam that others have taken apart and posted pictures. I expect it to have an IR filter on the back of the lens assembly as long as they have not changed it. 
I already discounted this camera that I started on this post, but I still wanted to know if it could be used, because it is cheaper if I want to make more of these and has less stuff you don't need (LED's, microphone, extra mic connector on the cable etc).
