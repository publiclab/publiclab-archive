hi [@sagarpreet](/profile/sagarpreet), I guess that's another way of implementing reply-by-email to tweet by redirecting the user to Twitter, where the user will tweet his comment and then your project would fetch the comment to PL's website.It sounds good and I would include this feature if no other solution seems available.Thanks for the suggestion !!!
