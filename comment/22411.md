1) yes, P and T are pressure and temp. There's Pstd and Pact (P standard and P actual) same for temperature.  Those are the temperature at standard conditions and the temperature right now.

2) yes, it should be Qcalc, but there's no equation for Qcalc anywhere.  I agree, since Qact is supposed to be an independent variable and a direct measurement, it makes no sense to have it be a calculated factor. 

I think the manual suffers a clarity issue in that it explains how the calibration was conducted amidst explaining how to use the calibration.  Under field conditions, the Qact equation is used to calculate the "actual" flow rate based on the indicated flow rate.  

In the calibration procedure, the same formula (I'm assuming) is used to calculate Qcalc, while Qact is a direct measurement of flow, not a calculated number.

In the manual, a sample calibration chart, _to be used in the field_ is where the Qact equation is listed, while Qcalc is explained on the opposite page as a factor used only during calibration.

here's how the pages look in the manual, for context:

3) I omitted the absolute value from the %Diff calculation because there were positive and negative percentages given in Airmetrics reference numbers.  I'm not sure it makes much of a difference to display negative percentages.
