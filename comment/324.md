thanks for the suggestion. I sent the UV camera off to another PLOTS chapter but hope to get it back soon. The Hoya 340 filter we're using does not list any significant IR leakage, so I'm moderately confident. I'd like to test it with a spectrometer though. which luckily we also have been working on.
