The hitch pins really wouldn't go in until I opened them up. I first focused (as you have above) on opening up the hole and clearing the path.  no dice, just couldn't push them in.  I gradually opened them to their current state.  I think they're quite secure, it still takes a solid tug to get them out. 

If anything, I'd suggest pre-opening the pins and shipping them at an easier but still safe opening level to prevent someone from modifying them too much:

Drilling out the fiberglass rod is less than ideal, I agree.  I'm not too fond of it as a task in a kit.  We've been playing around with under-sized rubberized loop clamps-- 1/8" inner diameter for a 1/4" dowel, and they hold quite firm to the end of a shaft. I wonder if a steel or aluminum one could bite through the vinyl tubing to hold the shaft in place?

[@Ranon](/profile/Ranon), want to take a look at [@cfasties](/profile/cfasties)'s leg brackets and see if you can re-model them with some clearer screw mounts?
