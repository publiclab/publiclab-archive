Hello [@warren](/profile/warren) Sir, I am grateful to you for the feedback. Thank you so much, Sir. I did the changes in the navbar section. Can u please check it now, is this seems alright?

By toolbar section, do you mean the toolbar that is on the sandbox page of the Infragram? 

Sandbox page link: https://infragram.org/sandbox/index.html
I'm working on the wireframe of the sandbox page, soon I'll publish it here.

I added the complete wireframing of the Infragram main page. Can you please review it and provide me the feedback Sir? 
Thank you SirðŸ˜Š
