I'm new to the cellphone-becomes-a-photospec phenomenon, as I was told about this by a colleague.  As an AP Chem teacher, I'm looking for hacks to do this instead of buying a bunch of spectrophotometers (which are expensive).  Is this something you were able to have students replicate?  My students have smart phones and can get Google Chrome on it, but I'm concerned about the data-noise and getting lost in the technology instead of focusing on the chemistry.  Ideas?
