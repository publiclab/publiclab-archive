Ah, great points.  Our initial idea was around just this sort of 'markdown import' you're describing, and it does seem like it has some nice advantages (and avoids the security hiccups you're describing).  In fact, we started to write up the 'markdown import' idea here:  https://github.com/p-v-o-s/publiclab-research-workflow  

You'll see in that README that Jeff Walker had created a mockup of what this sort of feature might look like:  a place to insert a URL that points to a markdown file in a github repo; a script then translates the github relative directory references in the markdown into URLs that publiclab.org can use to render the data in the research note.  

Could there be, maybe, a 'link to github repo' button next to a Research note, akin to an 'image import' button?  Then, whenever it was activated with the associated URL, the content of the reserach note would be updated with the remote github repo's markdown (and associated files)?
Yes, the markdown would also be exposed on github -- ould it be possibl
