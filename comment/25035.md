Yes when you see the live webcam feed on pi.local, you're basically just accessing a website which is streaming the pi camera video, so it doesn't register on your computer as a plugged-in webcam.

For now I have been doing what warren said, which is just taking photos and uploading them to spectral workbench manually. But if you really want a live option without having to wait, one way to do it is by creating a "virtual webcam" out of the web stream from pi.local.

One software that does this is OBS (https://obsproject.com/). It's not part of PublicLab but it is an open source project that allows you to use a window or a part of your screen as a live webcam, which you could then connect to the spectralworkbench capture interface. You'd just have to select your webpage with pi.local running as the webcam input source.

It's not ideal but it's just an option for now. You'll probably want to change the preview settings to a higher resolution on the cam settings (because the resolution for preview and capture can be different).
