Thank you very much for such details explanation. I never thought about getting the reference to compare with the result. That is a good idea.

Since this is a school project for my daughter and my background is in IT, not science I'll post more questions as I progress. Specially when we start measuring it and seeing the result.

I am trying to find a cheaper spectrometer. The DIY specotmeter 3.0 is sold out. Any other alternative under $100.

Really appreciate your help!
