Re: CCTV to webcam - [@shubham](/profile/shubham)
I have not done this myself, though I did set up CCTV/DVR security system a few years ago.  I did some searching regarding this and honestly, from what I found, you are better off getting a low cost usb web cam from a money perspective.  There are USB units around which will accept CCTV such as 
->http://www.walmart.com/ip/USB-Live2-USB-Video-Capture-Device-Windows-PC/13969202, 
and here -> http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Description=video%20capture%20usb&Submit=ENE 
but the price looks out of whack compared to even a mid-range USB webcam which can handle stream capture and still capture as well.

Being that you are from Delhi and I am not familiar with what is available there, Shubham, l help where I can, but am afraid that will be limited due to location...
