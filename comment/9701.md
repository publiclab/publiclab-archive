liz - I'll do my best to get it working by Friday.  In order to get a bare-bones installation plugged in to mapknitter, I'll need to write some `.erb` templates and add some tables to the database.  The database will probably be the most complicated.

I'm new to rails, so it may take me some time - I'll let you know where I stand on Thursday.  I hope I can get it working by Friday - I'd love to get some feedback ASAP.
