Did you remove the camera's IR block filter before you installed the red filter?

If so, the blue channel in your photos should be a good NIR photo. It sort of looks like it is, but I'm not sure.

The red channel in your photos should be mixed NIR and red and could be used to represent visible light in computations of NDVI. But the red channel in your photos is overexposed so it does not have very good information in it. 

The standard protocol is to set a custom white balance that exaggerates the brightness of the blue channel in every photo. Your camera apparently does not allow that. So it will be difficult to take photos that can be converted directly to NDVI or other plant health indices.
