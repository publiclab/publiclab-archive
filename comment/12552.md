Hi all,

thanks for comments. I have added a word doc outlining my methodology and initial results. I am unsure how to divide spectra of a sample by spectra of a white card reading from a light source using Spectral Workbench. I have had to use another program for this. Also how can you export a spectra as a .csv or excel plot from Spectral Workbench? This is critical for my work. Additionally I cannot take simultaneous measurements - this is not an option in the field. Is there another way to do this in Spectral Workbench?
