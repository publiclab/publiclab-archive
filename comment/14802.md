First, ALL displayed plots used for comparison MUST have the same displayed 'X' axes wavelength range .... anything else is just too visually deceptive. "Shape" means nothing when the X-spans are different by a large percentage.

Next, your plots still show a very narrow BW measured response (relative to the given reference) and so discovering that root cause should be first priority. Anything else is just distraction at this stage. FWHM is mostly useful for narrow-band signal; not broad-band responses because narrow-band signals are generally quite symmetrical within the region of interest whereas wide-band signals often hold no such characteristics so FWHM becomes meaningless.
