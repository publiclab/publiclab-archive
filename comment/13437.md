Wow, the 660/850 camera focuses well across the image. That's good to know it can be done with a 1.0 mm thick filter. The 475/850 camera looks a little funny at the edges, but maybe that's the filter doing something weird with the wavelengths. 

You are right that there is essentially no sign of vignetting. That's also good to see.

The exposure on those photos is perfect. In all three color channels, the white target is not overexposed (it's < 255) and the black target is not underexposed (it's > zero). That is not easy to do.

Are your NDVI images calibrated or based on the custom white balance? 

Thanks for posting these.

Yikes, where did your comment go?
