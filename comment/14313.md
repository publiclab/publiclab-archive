Hi Matt,
  good to hear you got it working :)  I have switched to single elastic bands now, and you're right, it does make it much easier.  The instructions used the bands I had at the time, but the next revision will have single bands.  I am also trying to work out a way of pulling them through from the bottom, which would make it much easier to do without fouling the gears.
  The illumination tower is a big weak point, and the next version makes it a separate clip-on part.  Hopefully that will solve quite a few problems, but I'm still tweaking that design.  Hopefully in a few weeks v5.15 will be ready for others to play with (you can see my progress at the moment on github).
  A 5mm LED mount would be really easy to add, so I'll put that on the to-do list.

Richard
