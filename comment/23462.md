 Great proposal Gautami! Really liked attention you given to the small details and nice designs. 

Question: As per your proposal, the testing time would be at end but don't you think while working on such a project which involves designs and UI, testing should be done after each implementation? Also, see here - https://publiclab.org/notes/lekhidugtal/03-23-2019/soc-proposal-enhancing-the-ui-of-publiclab-and-relevant-changes-to-server#c23398  how we are thinking of taking user feedback.

Also, you work on tag page and other contributions are awesome, but you haven't opened any FTO issues. We really encourage interns to create some FTOs from their project so as to involve new contributors in their project and community.

Thanks!
