Dear Chris, 
                 First of all thanks for your prompt reply. I have few more things which i am confused about:
1. If i put a red filter, so my red channel would mostly contain red spectrum while the blue will mostly contain infrared spectrum, what about the green channel, will i get green visible light in green channel, this is because i plan to compute  NDWI index, for water content detection?
2. What is the purpose/need for custom white balance?
3. For blue filters, does it only allow blue spectrum and near infrared only?
4. If there are any related literatures, journals published by the Public labs team, please share the link. 

Thank you once again.
