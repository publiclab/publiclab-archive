 Hi all, I had seen this issue on GitHub but unfortunately missed this discussion note.. 
Here's what I had posted on github as a suggestion

I saw [@edie_blues](/profile/edie_blues)' current design on the link she shared and it's similar to this one.. I think we can improvise on this and make our dash much more productive...

* we should keep the header bar the same as ours
*  we can use the `overview grids` for `wikis`, `research notes`, `activities` and `questions`
* somewhere between `overview` and `near me` could lie our `participate` content
* the `near me` map feature could come in the charts and graphs place
* we can use the `top countries` table for tags
*  a little bit of improvisation on the `earnings` table is required

Hope this adds to the discussion here..
Thanks! ðŸ˜ƒ
