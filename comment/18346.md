[@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) -- [@shannon](/profile/shannon) mentioned [Gulf Monitoring Consortium](http://gulfmonitor.org/) has a ton of work on this -- do you have some links you could share if you have a moment? THANKS!!

Also, [@liz](/profile/liz) or perhaps [@devinb](/profile/devinb) or other [#edgi](/tag/edgi) people -- is there an EDGI mirror or improvement on the TRI database? Thank you!!!
