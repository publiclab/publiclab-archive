Hi [@ajongafaczinkeng](/profile/ajongafaczinkeng),  I have some feedback:

I have seen the mock-ups on how we can improve the current UI,  we would like to see how exactly the page will look like, represented in the mock-ups. e.g you show how the stretch screen will be on proposed solution 1, if you plan to have the box black as is currently, fill the box in black so that we can see how the new page will look like. Hope this makes sense.

 There is also some contraction in the information under "proposed solution" and tasks under "milestones/timeline" e.g on the proposed solution 2 and 3 you talk of the improvements of the "Q&A" section and in milestones week 7, you have a task of "creating a Q&A page. Kindly iron these out for clarity. 
Thanks for posting
