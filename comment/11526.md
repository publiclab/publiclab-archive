I really like the idea of making useful data by pointing a camera out my window. I have a Raspberry Pi lying around (no camera yet) and lots of windows with trees outside. 
I guess the window should be one that is not going to be opened all summer so the equipment is not disturbed. Also, changes other than vegetative should not be a big part of the scene (no cars parking intermittently, or new structures being built). Does it make any difference whether half of the scene is white pine trees (the other half is Vermont deciduous forest or lawn). How will the Pi do if installed on a window in an unheated garage (drops to -20 F in winter)? There are also lots of bugs in the garage. This could be a fun project.
