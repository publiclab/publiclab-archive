Hi [@rexagod](/profile/rexagod) [@maggpi](/profile/maggpi) I wondered if you'd be interested in collaborating a bit on this use of the `matcher-core` library -- [@rexagod](/profile/rexagod), i don't yet see your PR on `image-sequencer` but once merged and documented, perhaps [@maggpi](/profile/maggpi) could try to put it to use to replicate this amazing proof of concept above!
