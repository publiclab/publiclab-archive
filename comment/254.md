The jury's still out on the final flying height, but I think it was about 30 meters (so really low).  There is no good imagery to use to reference this mosaic because the sand shifts so quickly and the plants are very hard to see in more traditional photos.  That's why there are targets on the ground.  Each of the black squares with the white cross were logged with a GPS to help georeference.
