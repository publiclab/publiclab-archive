Hi [@zengirl2](/profile/zengirl2), thanks for the reblog! The rock artwork you may have seen isn't related to the photogrammetry, those are casting of small boulders using latex molds... thematically related of course :)

Yes I will keep the next Barnraising on my calendar. Also I do have an exhibit coming up in NY if you're interested I can send an invitation, send me your email address.
