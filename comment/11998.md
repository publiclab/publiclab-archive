I've been a major advocate for the Mobius in everything from [Kite Aerial Photography](http://publiclab.org/notes/ajawitz/06-07-2015/2015-kap-mapping-season-in-midcoast-maine) to [UAVs](http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/08-05-2014/aerial-mapping-drone-for-under-60) to even using it [underwater](http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/07-25-2014/grassroots-underwater-photography)!  
  As for the lens distortion issue, I've found the previously mentioned workflow by eustatic to be relatively straight-forward.  There's also the [HUGIN Photostitcher](http://hugin.sourceforge.net/) and [DIGIKAM](https://www.digikam.org/) programs for Linux.  Neither are particularly user-friendly but they also both support plugins that can be written and shared with others.  So instead of having everyone follow a multi-step workflow, we could just write a script with all the Mobius lens parameters and post it as a plugin that can be executed out of the box.

  Considering the modular nature of the Mobius firmware and hardware components, I wonder if we've only scratched the surface of what can be done with this device!?  The lens modules for example, can be easily swapped out between "standard" or "widescreen" versions on the same camera.  Perhaps the same could be done with the IR modified lens on the Infragram Point and Shoot?  The lenses can also use an [extension cable](http://www.amazon.com/26PIN-Extension-Cable-Mobius-ActionCam/dp/B00O2QQ160) to separate them from the camera housing itself.  Perhaps an adapter cable could be created to support dual lenses?  Perhaps some of the components used in the [NDVI BBB Cape](http://publiclab.org/notes/gpenzo/03-25-2015/ndvi-cape-for-the-beagle-bone) could help with such a device?

  I wonder what options there are for either combing or incorporating other sensors into the camera hardware?  Perhaps the Camera can be combined with a Raspberry Pi Model A+ to add powerful real-time processing features like OpenCV or any number of physical sensors?  Thus far, the PLOTs IR Point and Shoot is the closest I have yet found to a hardware modification that really takes advantage of the Mobius capabilities.  So it would sense that further iteration on the MAC capabilities would also come from PLOTs community!
