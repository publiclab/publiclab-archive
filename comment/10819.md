While methane has a main absorption band between 3200-3400nm, it also has weaker bands around 2300nm and 1650nm.  For the 3200-3400nm band EOC sells the Lms36PD series photodiodes. In the 2300um range they sell the Lms24PD.

Electro Optical Components also sells [an evaluation kit](http://www.eoc-inc.com/LED%20Microsensor/evaluation%20kits.htm) for experimenting: 

"for first-time users we announce sample systems and kits that enable fast preliminary experiments with mid-infrared LED-PD optopairs for different detection purposes." 

It's described 'low-cost', but compared to what?
