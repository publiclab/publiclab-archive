I really liked the suggestion that was made at the Barnraising to put the agile learning quotes front and center on the website. "Whoever comes is the right people," "Whenever it starts is the right time," etc -- I think it does a lot to very quickly create a welcoming atmosphere and frame how people engage with Public Lab as a community in a positive way.
