On the plots, it looks like you have linearly sampled x-data, around 300 nm to 700 nm. The question is whether each x-value is equally spaced. If the difference of one pixel width on the sensor yields the same nm difference between each measured point, then you have uniform sampling and you can ignore integrals.

The best way to tell is look at your x-values for the rawest data you can look at which is still measured in nanometers. Is the difference from one x-value to the next always the same? If so, you don't need to integrate, you can simply accumulate. The area under the curve is preserved, relatively (mathematically every integral, no matter where along the x-axis, will be off by a factor of the sampling width aka difference in x-values). The half-way comparison is also relative, so you wouldn't need proper integration.
