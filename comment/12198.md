Hi Jack, I have been doing some CV experiments with the device. I examined the .csv file and seem to be getting about ~280 data points for a run of about 28 seconds, which means the ADC is sampling the voltage and current read pins at about 10 Hz if I'm not mistaken. Do you know what parameters within the code would have to be altered to increase this rate if it is possible? Also, I would like to try getting the CV experiment to run multiple times from the initial to the final and back and maybe one or two more rounds before the experiment stops. I see the code has a variable for number of runs for data logging parameters and it is set to 1 run, but I'm not sure if increasing this value will make the experiment repeat. Thanks
