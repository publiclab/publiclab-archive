[@stoft](/profile/stoft) Hey dave, ok I did both spectral captures again with a 470nm Blue LED using a quartz cuvette for both, one using Plab's spectral workbench data capture program and Spekwin32's capture program, on the spekwin data I was able to adjust the gamma correction and lowered the default by half to increase the luminance and I was able to subtract the dark counts also, it would be nice if I could do that with Plab's program.

You are right, the shorter wavelength made a big difference, I should have known better.

Here is the plot showing the Plab data, with a FWHM of 27

Now here is the one using Spekwin32, with a FWHM of 21

Certainly the spectral lines are very different but the wavelength is correct for Fluorescein at an excitation wavelength of 470nm. Do you think it makes any difference that the LED has a 30 degree focal lens attached? I had to put it attach it because the viewing angle for the LED is 140 degrees.
