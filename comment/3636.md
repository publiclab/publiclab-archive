The corduroy appearance of the image is a mystery. The vertical lines are very regular in places, so I assumed they were related to the lines on the grating.  But the grating lines would be about 5 or 6 times closer together, although they might still be producing the  striped effect.  The pixels on the sensor are likewise much finer than the vertical lines. 

I guess the smoothing we are doing is vertical smoothing, or vertical averaging, column averaging, pixel column averaging, column smoothing, vertical striping, grain removal, grain reduction, vertical grain reduction, or Vertical Grain edginess reduction, also known as V'Ger.
