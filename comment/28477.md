Hi [@SahilS](/profile/SahilS) - thank you for your proposal! I appreciate how deeply you've gone into Rails code to see how your work will be implemented, but have also produced mockups of how it will look -- a great balance of visual and code planning. 

> Display of coauthored posts 

For this, I wonder if it might be better to think about how we could include coauthored posts /mixed in/ with authored posts? This is a substantial database design problem, since the way we collect coauthored posts is very different, and i find it hard to see how we can order by date for both authored and coauthored posts. That's why i see why you took a simpler and more robust approach. But when i think of the utility of coauthored posts, I wonder if it would be better to consider them "just like regular posts" conceptually. I think the next step here would be to 

1. consider the technical challenges of displaying them together
2. consult with community reps to see if a separate section is a reasonable solution, given the technical complexity

Then to come to a decision. Does that make sense? This could conceivably happen during the work period, but what do you think in particular about the first question? 

Thank you for your time!!!! ðŸŽ‰
