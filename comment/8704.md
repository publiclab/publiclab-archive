I just updated the post to include links to the vector files to cut the mount for the flower pot, which is a 8" x 8" green planter available at HomeDepot http://www.homedepot.com/p/Dynamic-Design-Newbury-8-in-x-8-in-Lotus-Green-Poly-Planter-NB0824LO/203629861

I also joined the PLOTS-Baltimore-DC mail group and yes I plan to attend the Geo events coming this weekend
Thanks so much for the likes and the feedback
