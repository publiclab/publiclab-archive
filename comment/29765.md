My experience with the trip was not quite what I expected. I expected that we were going to come to some clear section of the river and run the baby legs through the water for a while. Instead we were in a section where the plant life interfered with our water collection. The most common item I saw was water bottles, and they might take up to 450 years to decompose. Our community is especially affected by this kind of pollution as it has an affect on our marine life in the Gulf of Mexico, a major source of economic income.
