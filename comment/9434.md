[@amysoyka](/profile/amysoyka) The Powermag graphic portrays the PM fractions based on source sampling techniques used for power plant emission sampling.  The source sampling techniques cool and condense the sample to a standard temperature.  However, condensable and precursor fractions don't typically apply to ambient PM monitoring.  Ambient PM monitoring typically measures whatever is naturally condensed at the current ambient temperature and precursors don't usually interfere.

[@mathew](/profile/mathew) The EPA definition of PM fractions can be found in 40 CFR Part 50, see http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title40/40cfr50_main_02.tpl

"particulate matter shall be measured in the ambient air as PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter LESS THAN OR EQUAL to a nominal 10 micrometers)"

and PM2.5 is a "LESS THAN OR EQUAL to a nominal 2.5 micrometers" 

The 50% cut point refers to the EFFICIENCY at which particles are removed by the selective inlet at the given size.  So for PM10, the inlet removes 50% of particles at 10 microns but above 10 microns the removal efficiency increases and below 10 microns removal efficiency declines.  Thus the resultant fraction is not a normal distribution (e.g. 50% above and 50% below) but a skewed distribution (see graph below).  Also, the rate at which removal efficiency changes is referred to as the cut point SHARPNESS.

The EPA definition is illustrated as:
