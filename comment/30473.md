Biomes are groups of like ecosystems that have similar plants, animals, geology, and climate. They are important to environmental science because it is useful to study the environment and the cycles within it. They have both abiotic and biotic resources available to them. Abiotic resources include land and water, while biotic resources include plants and animals. There are producers, which are plants who produce energy from the sun, consumers, who are animals that eat the plants as well as other animals, and decomposers that break down dead bodies and organisms into nutrients to be recycled. Those are all biotic factors in a biome.
