Hey [@MaggPi](/profile/MaggPi), sorry for the delay! Yes, there are differences. Although the EarthEngine uses the same raw data, it processes them to make them easily accessible to everyone. However, if you need the data for your research, e.g. for calculations or because you want to use it in your own IDE, it is recommended to use the raw data directly from the source without any organisation editing it.
