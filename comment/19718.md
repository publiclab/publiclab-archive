Also love your microscope improvement suggestions! Especially:

* moving bolts far out to edges
* washcloth! Amazing idea - simple and affordable!
* seeing the 8 megapixel noted on the camera -- haha not quite ðŸ˜„

Your onion and leaf photos are great! Very good detail on the leaf cells. Did you stain them at all?

I'm hoping to photograph some chlorophyll at some point. Like in the opening shots of the Infragram video - (which i found online) https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/infragram-the-infrared-photography-project

Anyways i'd also love to see a comparison between the webcam and the Raspberry Pi cameras. Great work, again!
