Canoes shouldn't create eddies that penetrate very deeply into the water current.

Did the dye penetrate into the water or rest on top? If the dye floated on top, you might want to increase the dye's density by dissolving some salt into the dye (it sounds like there's already plenty of salt in the water). Dye that is submerged might be harder to see in diminished concentrations, but it might follow currents better. Warm enough water should surface as it reaches colder water, so you might even see a dyed swell downstream a bit.
