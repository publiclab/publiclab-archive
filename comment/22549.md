Also, a couple notes on other things you mentioned -- the main image does not get cropped, but the preview image is displayed oddly, so I can understand how that would be confusing. Finally, I believe I've seen an intermittent bug where the "publish" button will occasionally not get activated, but clicking into and out of the title input will fix this. 

I'm going to file an issue for the Post button enabling so we can get this on the radar of the software folks (myself included) -- and if you'd like to highlight any of these other issues for fixes or have suggestions or feedback, please speak up, as it's extremely helpful to hear when things are not going well or not working as expected -- in fact, there's no other way for the Web team to find out!

Again, apologies for what sounds like a frustrating experience and thanks for writing it up. We have a very small team working on this stuff and your help is deeply appreciated. 

Chris, I'm also going to open an issue for YouTube embedding -- thanks for reporting that as well: https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor/issues/100

Both of these will take some work to flesh out -- the bug in order to narrow down what's actually happening, and the YouTube feature request will take some design work and testing to develop that new feature. But these issues initiate that process -- thanks again.
