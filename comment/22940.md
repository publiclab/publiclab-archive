Hi liz! I see there are several moving parts here:

1. some is like wiki gardening
2. some is like communication (posting update summaries)
3. some is facilitating meetings and getting more real-time discussion

For all of the above, I'd like to emphasize the need for "welcoming tone" and to be especially welcoming and encouraging to newcomers -- kind of like the great posters we see at Public Lab [#Barnraisings](/tag/Barnraisings)!

Some of the reasoning and tips on friendliness are in this post about [software outreach](https://publiclab.org/n/15358) which i think apply here too!

Especially:

* mentioning and appreciating newcomers
* making sure you /ask/ people to participate
* thanking people for helping make the project happen, even if they're just asking a question
* warm and friendly tone!

After all, without newcomers, there won't be any community!

To reiterate from that last blog post, 

> Get out there and make sure people know they're welcome! They're not clairvoyant -- you need to put some work into it!

:-)

Thanks Liz - love this post!
