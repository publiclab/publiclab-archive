This screw actually /doesn't/ calibrate the sensor.  It sets the /threshold/ for digital output.

I completely forgot about this when I wrote my research notes and I should fix it!

The sensor board has a switch on it that you can switch between D(igital) and A(nalog.)

If the sensor board is set to Digital it will send a HIGH signal (approximately 4.5V to 5V) when the "turbidity" is above a certain threshold and a LOW (approximately .2V to .5V).  You set that threshold by turning that screw.

If the sensor board is set to Analog, it will send a signal ranging from 0V to 5V. 

My /guess/ is that one of your sensors was set to "Digital" -- the one that was giving you a .2V to .4V reading.

I did some testing of individual sensors that I had lying around and they all gave roughly consistent readings (varying by .1 to .2) so there was not a lot of variablity among the three sensors I have.  I will write up some more of this testing data in a separate note.
