May not work with those sensors, but.. Many of the weather stations can be wirelessly received with an rtlsdr ( they cost about $20). The program a lot of people use to translate is rtl_433.  It has both Windows and Linux versions.  You need to know the frequency the wx station transmits on and there is also an interface program, all of which are freeware.  Sorry, the translation to this is It will take a while to get used to all the info.  Go to rtl-sdr.com for a little background.
