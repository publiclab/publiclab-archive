I think it would be great- really excited to work with you this coming weekend! I read over the materials you posted, I think the fishing bobs would be a great way of capturing the micro-hotspots, especially with lake current changes (more so than relying on monthly Landsat). Also trying to figure out how to potentially auto-capture images of the fish that experience "sudden death" from these lake hotspots (I know... kinda morbid, but potentially potent for Grist and other folks making case to DEC).
