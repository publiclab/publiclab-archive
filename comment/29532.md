From this [Guidebook for Developing a Community Air Monitoring Network](https://trackingcalifornia.org/cms/file/imperial-air-project/guidebook):  _If possible, permanently install a community monitor at the colocation site so your conversion equation can be kept up to date. Particle composition in an area may change over time, so the conversion equation should be updated regularly to account for this. If ongoing colocation isn’t feasible, the colocation should last for a year if possible so that seasonal differences can be accounted for. If this is not possible, then the community air monitor should be colocated for one month during each season._

The [EPA Colocation Instruction Guide](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-01/documents/collocation_instruction_guide.pdf) doesn't specify how long to colocate the sensors, but they recommend setting the reading frequency of the low-cost sensor to at least as frequent as the reference sensor.
