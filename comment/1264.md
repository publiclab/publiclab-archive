Yes -- both. This is really just a randomly chosen one that is at the low end in price, is portable, has similar range and resolution to what we think ours is. So many people have asked for comparisons of data, and it really is something we have to do... but we may have to settle for whatever spectrometer we can borrow. Do you happen to have one?
