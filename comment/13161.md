Wow, very exciting. I see the build cost was $3000, but much of that is the nice camera and lens; the long-pass Raman edge filter, though, costs $425 -- where did you source that, and are any cheaper alternatives available? And are the laser clean filters strictly necessary?

I liked these illustrations from the paper especially:

A picture of the sample/laser setup:
