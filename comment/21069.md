This is great to hear,&nbsp;[@xose](/profile/xose) - I've actually found that it should be possible to get a Pi Zero W running BOTH as an access point and connecting to another WiFi network.&nbsp;
  

I've started an issue here to work towards a recipe for that:&nbsp;[https://github.com/publiclab/pi-builder/issues/34](https://github.com/publiclab/pi-builder/issues/34)

  

We do have a web terminal connected too, which can help sometimes, in one of the recipes at&nbsp;[https://github.com/publiclab/pi-builder/pulls](https://github.com/publiclab/pi-builder/pulls)

  

Would you be interested in posting some of your configuration steps to the above issue (or another that interests you) and we can work towards getting a reproducible build of that setup for anyone to download? The hope is that small incremental improvements to the image can be retained and versioned, making them more reproducible each time a change is made. This can be hard with Pi development -- so much can be lost since it's all "trapped" on that SD card :-)

  

Have you had much luck with the timelapse feature of RPi Cam web interface? I had some trouble downloading it in bulk since it tries to generate a .zip file, which then fails in the web interface.&nbsp;

> Amazing!  At IMVEC we're working in a couple of cameras using RPi zero and one of them involves internet connection to display obtained images online.  Both involve the use of the Witty pi nimi board to manage energy of the pi.  Using the combined image everything goes like a charm. The camera is accesible and the command line works perfectly.  Trying to connect to internet using wifi I'm unable to turn off the acces point and turn on the wifi.  I've set up wifi credentials using wpa\_supplicat (wpa\_phrase and so on..) and turn ap0 down using "ifconfig ap0 down". After this "ifconfig wlan0 up" but nothing happens...  Woul be great to have a little interface in the captive portal page to turn of acces point and connect to a wifi signal and download packages needed for the different recipes ;D.  I understand further connection should be done using terminal + keyboard + monitor...
