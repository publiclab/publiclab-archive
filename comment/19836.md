A couple edits and suggestions that came from the workshop we hosted on  6/16/18. 

Edits on directions:

- Remind people that the tallies are for every 2cm, so 5 makes 1inch.
- It's important to emphasize that people should mark every 2cm on their gauges, not just the ones on the first inch.
- Remind people to keep their gauge on a flat surface when drawing the lines. 

Ideas:

People shared ideas on where to put the rain gauges and how to get them up. Some suggestions included using sign posts and zip ties. Another idea was to put it in a flower pot and stand it up outside. 
Another note of importance is that here in New Orleans, we have mosquitos that carry diseases. To keep them from breeding in your rain gauge, you can add a small piece of screen to the opening of the bottle (the small part of the funnel).
