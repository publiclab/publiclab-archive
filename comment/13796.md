[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) - That is really interesting to hear and thanks for the link to Ned's note there. I actually have an installed GHI camera that currently acts as my visible, however we've only managed to get it to output QVGA images so it's not really helpful (plus it's quite slow). A fellow programmer that I work with is currently testing out a better camera that will act as an update. We can then print out using a 3D printer a sort of filter mount in front for easy switching between red and blue filters. We have plenty of Roscolux [#2007](/n/2007) (Storaro Blue) and [#19](/n/19) (Fire Red) as well. So really looking forward to mounting this new camera.

In terms of white balance, Yawcam does grant me access to such properties:

However I haven't really toggled the white balance except for disabling the auto white balance function which was default. I thought that the default 6500K was a sufficient temperature to use.
