Please report everything that you are being discharged into the water seems weird.  But a question.  Every now and then, a storm sewer in a relatively remote location with a small plant would need sampled.  The ISCO sampler was pulled out and since many were on vacation, I was volunteered   to go out and help sample ( usually a group of 2 people).  We put the sampler in and came back a day later to get the water sample.  It was interesting.  The probe had toilet paper on it.  And while we were there, we saw brown waste flowing down the storm sewer.  The EPA was contacted.  But apparently, there are some situations where this is perfectly legal.  My point- please report and keep track of all situations like this, but don't expect immediate action.
