I do have photos of the camera rig.  I should post those.  It's pretty similar to the plastic bottle rig, but it uses a plastic bathroom trashcan instead.  The top of the rig has a picavet and the camera attaches to the bottom of the picavet structure.  I'm not sure that explains it very well.  I'll post the pictures and then link it.
