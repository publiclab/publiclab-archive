Awesome explained, and this is very helpful! I use cloud storage usually for everything, and for sharing as well, and I always found this: http://www.winzip.com/win/en/features/file-sharing.html to be the easiest way, but I had no idea "peer to peer" existed, and what it is. Thanks a lot for sharing this! :)
