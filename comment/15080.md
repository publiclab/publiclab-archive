Thanks, that seems to work to open the f3d file (it's not done uploading it yet). I guess another way is for us to share the files at the Autodesk Central Authoritarian File Server.

Last night I kept working on the version I made from your stp file and deleted the leg holes and made new ones. I couldn't figure out how to control the angles so both legs were perfectly symmetrical, but I got them close.

I printed a draft this morning and it looks good.

I'm printing four of them now with solid plastic in the upper half. This should be strong enough that the slight advantage of ABS over PLA is irrelevant so the brackets can be PLA like everything else. 

Ranon, when you started making new versions of the KAPtery rigs in Fusion 360, how did you start? Did you import the old STLs and modify those forms? Or did you import the old STLs and make sketches of the plan and then model from scratch in Fusion 360? Or did you just start from scratch? I might want to tackle another KAPtery part to keep improving my Fusion 360 skills.

Thanks for your help,  
Chris
