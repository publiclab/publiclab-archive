The burmese python is a indigenous species to the U.S and resides in humid states like Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana. Their population has a chance to skyrocket due to the climate in the area we live in being similar to that of South Asia. Thanks to public lab we're able to learn about these things that could give us awareness about important things in our world.
