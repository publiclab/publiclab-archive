Check this reference:  "Evaluation of red cabbage dye as a potential natural color for pharmaceutical use" by Neela Chigurupati, et. al. Industrial Journal of Pharmaceutics, 241(2002)293-299.   

You need to go to section 3.4 "Stability of red cabbage solutions in water".  To quote "the dye was most stable at room temperature and pH3(percentage of degradation was only 1-5% over a period of 10 days).  However, it was least stable at 50C and pH 8(percentage of degradation was 79-98% over a period of 10days)."  Section 3 .5 had some interesting info on using it as an indicator, as well.  So, at the very least, the cabbage indicator needs to be stored in acidic media.
