I recently took near infrared photos in banana farm  using DJI Phantom 3 Professional with Mobius ActionCam (modified infrared)  which i bought from public labs...i took nearly 600 images from the field. Now i am having trouble stiching all those images. I tried to stich using Agisoft Photoscan Professional, however the results are unsatisfactory. Has anyone tried merging large numbers of infrared photos together? 
Looking forward to your suggestions.

Thank you 

Cheers
