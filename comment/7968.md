Hi Mark,
I am glad to hear that you were able to get the program compiled.  I have no idea what the error message you refer to means.  Sometimes I get a similar message when I have not got the Stellaris LauchPad selected from the "tools" dropdown, but that has nothing to do with the fastdigitalwrite.  Since you are going for the PDIP pot, I assume that you age going to build this up on a breadboard.  Let me know if you are interested in a surface mount pcb.  I got the VCC powered board with the rail to rail amp running today and the test data look good.  I think I am ready to finalize the design and have some pcb's fabricated professionally.  I hope to get to writing up the hardware build tomorrow.
Let me know how this goes.  
Best,
Jack
