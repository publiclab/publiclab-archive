I wonder if thinking about "tweaking things until the histogram looks right" is the right approach -- in some ways, the idealization is that there are 3 separate R,G, and B images. If there is a lot of leakage between the channels, it's actually information lost, no? But perhaps that's OK. 

Custom white balance adjusts the relative exposure between those 3 color channels, and I'd hope that those sliders you're using do the same, in perhaps a constrained way. If we have a standard way to recompute the channel balance (which is to say, a standard deviation between channels... is that even possible without a reference?) we could add that as an automatic step in the processing, and it'd be more consistent, i hope.

But in images where there really isn't any photosynthesis going on, that might artificially inflate NDVI values, no?
