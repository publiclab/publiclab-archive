Tony, looks promising. The info from Chris is great as well. Lots of ways to go. Having committed many cameras secured with orange rubber bands to altitude, I'm less worried about their failure. However, in all these approaches, careful check for tears, loose connection, etc, is needed. Regarding the wobble, could use a couple of pieces of foam to snug the camera against the shroud.
