[@ottinger](/profile/ottinger), the Air Watch Bay Area platform is exciting! Please do post updates. I appreciate the ability to print out a daily report that includes instrument detection limits. Would there by a way to include expected precision as well? Including the health-relevant standards in the report is great too!
