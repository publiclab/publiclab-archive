Update on longevity: I inadvertently left a mobius running the intervelometer at every 6mins over the week of staff retreat. I now have 2490 of the most boring photos you've ever seen, but I can tell by the day/night phases that it captured over 10 days of continuous images, and the battery was not done yet. I still have yet to see my patience outlast the battery on a mobius in the deep-sleep mode!

Total use of the SD card was just 1.5 GB, so I think the battery will remain the weak link. This was using the stock battery of 880mAh. Easy to up this with a larger battery, plugged straight into the board. 

I believe using solar via some sort of trickle charge, or over USB would be a larger problem to solve. Plugging in through USB has been more problematic in ways I can't even really describe. It seems to prevent camera from running long term by tricking it into rebooting. Will need more investigation to solve this, but the ability to deploy using stock camera is very promising, even right out of the box!

Think I'll let my folks borrow one to do time lapse on some wildflowers as they bloom, just for fun.
