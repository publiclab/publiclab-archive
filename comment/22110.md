Just by way of context, in general, we try to develop lots of sub-libraries in pure JavaScript, like these:

https://github.com/publiclab/leaflet-environmental-layers/
https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.BlurredLocation
https://github.com/publiclab/inline-markdown-editor
https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor

This is so that they are more self-contained, maintainable, and have less JS/Ruby mixing. This is a good model and you might look closely at these examples!
