Looks like you can just load it as an image using this code, and insert it:

```
      var piImage = new Image();

      piImage.onload = function() {
        context.drawImage(piImage, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
      }

      piImage.src = "http://raspberry.local/cam_pic.php?time=" + new Date().getTime();
```

But we'll need to set up CORS permissions on the Pi to do this from SpectralWorkbench.org or Infragram.org, unless we run a version of that code on the Pi itself: https://enable-cors.org
