Mathew's notes on how overexposure/clipping can mess up curve shape are very important here and underscore [@stoft](/profile/stoft)'s encouragement that we screen for, and do our best to avoid, clipping. Just looking at this set: https://spectralworkbench.org/sets/show/1473

There, only the first one -- "IRCAM North Dakota Crude" seems to be clipping. It is quite different in shape, too. Clipping shown when you use "RGB mode" while looking the spectrum alone:

Perhaps we should display in-graph warnings *anytime* there's clipping - without looking at RGB, it's easy to miss when it happens.
