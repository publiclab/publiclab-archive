I def. agree -- that's what I was trying to get at with 'set a test here to "load test"' and [@bsugar](/profile/bsugar) actually posted a request for a method to test out rigidity, which is listed in [the "Limitations and Goals" section of the DSSK page](https://publiclab.org/wiki/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0#Limitations+&+Goals). Part of this question if the cost/robustness question -- and we could in theory set several different "levels" -- more expense for more rigidity, say. 

Could you repost your example tests there? I like the "3 foot drop" test and the USB unplug test (esp as it gets at my theorized challenges listed above). Thanks!
