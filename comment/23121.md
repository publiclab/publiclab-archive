Hi! There are two possible ways to fix this --are you sure you're entering your username correctly? It should be "Slava1" the same as on this site.

OR -- If you have two accounts, go to PublicLab.org and log out, you should be able to log out, and log back in with the one matching the one you want to use with SpectralWorkbench.org.
