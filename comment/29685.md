     Journal Entry 1 - I found an empty bag of doritos on the ground while on a walk. It was made by the frito lay company, to hold doritos chips. Since it is a single use product, it has only been used once. It was on the ground and not in the trash or recycling bin probably because whoever was using it was too lazy to throw it away.
