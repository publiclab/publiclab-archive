Biomes are important because they house communities of biotic and abiotic organisms. These biomes create a environment for plants and animals to survive. Biotic factors can be classified as producers, consumers, and decomposers. All these biotic components are interdependent. Organisms that depend on plants and other organisms for their food are consumers. Consumers lack the ability to capture solar energy and hence depend on producers for their food. Organisms such as insects, fungi (including molds), and bacteria feed on the dead bodies of other organisms. They convert the organic material from dead producers and consumers into simpler organic compounds, nutrients and gases. A predator feeds on its prey. Common examples of predator and prey are fox and rabbit, bear and fish, wolf and moose, great white shark and elephant seal, and cat and mouse. All the species in the ecosystem are interdependent. Any change in the number of predators will impact the number of preys. A biome provides a suitable ad balanced environment for theses aspects of the community to thrive.
