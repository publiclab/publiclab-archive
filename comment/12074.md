Since our inception, looking at and using Markdown has scared off posters-- and I know this because people have been telling me this for four years, in workshops, and I'm not alone.  How many people need to bring this feedback up before its treated seriously as actual feedback from real users who don't post, rather than one "question" among many that push us in "different directions?"

We've mitigated this barrier ( the high floor we ACTUALLY have) somewhat with drop-in image uploading and some style guides, but the intimidation factor of either not feeling able or not feeling able to learn to post "nice looking" research notes of the style that more expert Markdown users post is pretty high.

I would disagree that the issues of using Markdown for longer posts and wiki pages mean that fixing this issue with a WYSIWYG editor pushes us in the direction of longer-form content.  I think that is a poor framing of the issue.  This is merely the framing captured by Github, because it is the way current users understand the problem. It fails to capture the range of feedback we've actually gotten.
