Hi [@Jakub](/profile/Jakub) 

I re-read lots and lots of posts here, but basically depending on the IR filter you use, you should use a color card, a red card to set your white balance right. It's more or less to tell your camera what color is the baseline...

Check theses posts:

What I did later, was figuring out a way to save photos taken with the wrong settings. I am still trying to publish it. But you should always have the right white balance before taking any photos.

Hope this helps.
Best regards,
Rita
