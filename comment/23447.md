Great proposal Ananya! Although, your timeline looks good, but I think you should reserve some time for testing and feedback. You can also refer to the [@warren](/profile/warren)'s comment - https://publiclab.org/notes/lekhidugtal/03-23-2019/soc-proposal-enhancing-the-ui-of-publiclab-and-relevant-changes-to-server#c23398 which highlights how we can test the work.

Also, I liked that you've given time for FTOs in timeline üëç 

Thanks!
