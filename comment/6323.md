Hi all, http://spectraonline.com seems to have gone? Bad Request (Invalid Hostname)...  its maybe changed name after being absorbed by ThermoFisher?

Also while I'm about it,  I'm sure your all aware of this excellent site, which gives explanations for RGB, displacement etc etc and spectral range, angular change etc. i.e drift and range change occurs when you adjust the angle of the diffraction grating and or use a different diffraction:

Also where to buy alternative precision diffraction material at:
