This is some of the best information I've seen posted here about how the Public Lab spectrometer might be used to identify this type of environmental contaminant. This is really useful.

Do some of the heavy metals (mercury, lead) also have peaks in the visible or NIR range that might be emitted at lower temperature? If so, would these lesser peaks be lost in the continuous spectrum of the radiation from the heat source (e.g., a flame)? In other words, is it important not only that there is a peak in the detectable wavelength range, but that it is a big peak that might distinguish itself from the background?
