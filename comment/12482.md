Don, that's a pretty good case for project R&D having  an "in-between" stage where bigger production runs aren't ready to go but folks are making custom circuitry for field ready prototypes, and these boards will support that.  Through-hole soldering equipment is readily available and cheap in a way surface mount probably never will be, given the number of components.
