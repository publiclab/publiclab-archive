Ah, ok. Thanks for such a careful look at this. So we no longer get separate modified lenses -- we just get whole modified and unmodified cameras from the factory. It's very helpful to know that the loose lenses don't work well for the latest Mobius camera bodies, so we'll probably be retiring that option and just selling whole modified and unmodified Mobius cameras. If you'd like to exchange, please send it back to Kits at:

Public Lab
55 Cromwell St 1C
Providence RI 02907

Sorry for the trouble and thank you x1000000 for your help with this issue. It really makes a difference.

We'll add in a free extra lens with different geometry if you'd like to try that too on a newer Mobius body. Just discussed this with [@amanda](/profile/amanda) -- thanks again!
