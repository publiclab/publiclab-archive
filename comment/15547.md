Cool! I was thinking about attaching a peltier cooler to it. I can't find much info on what that does to a thermopile sensor though, since they basically already *are* peltier devices.

Another way of thinking about this approach -- commercial gas camera are designed to *detect* small leaks. If instead we try to make a camera that can *document* large leaks, we may have a different set of design tradeoffs than has been explored by commercial products.
