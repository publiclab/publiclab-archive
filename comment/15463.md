Don't we have to have an activity before we have a follow up activity? There are lots of ways to make this an activity and many ways to follow up (various cameras, different stream types, ruled post in the scene, different intervals, daylight only, video clips vs stills, motion detection, near unnatural stream inputs, etc.). This activity can be taken to many places. Someone should impose some directional constraints. Maybe I will try to replicate this activity with a Mobius ActionCam.
