OK, folks, I've compiled an initial list of our Soc Project Ideas from a lot of this brainstorming, incorporating some new ideas, expanding on old ones, and emphasizing MapKnitter a lot. I hope everyone will find ideas they like in this list. We can consider new additions, but this reflects a lot of our mission and focus as an environmental initiative, and it also reflects some careful planning of core projects to lay good groundwork for future projects.

With that in mind, we've focused more on the Notifications API than on React for `plots2`, but we have also made space for React-based projects to potentially play a role in MapKnitter and Spectral Workbench. I hope the experience and infrastructure we might gain from those projects could be an important part of a prototype React UI on `plots2`, but I want to be honest that we need to learn more through these prototypes before committing to a major change on plots2. I hope this sounds reasonable!
