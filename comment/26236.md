Thanks Chris, unfortunately we generally have sunny weather so a laser is generally out.  In addition, last year we rec'd 4.14m (163") of snow, with about 2m sticking around all winter.  Granted that's on the high side and resulted in washing out all my other stream monitoring projects, it's still something I need to consider.  I'm currently looking at a sonar unit with humidity and temperature compensation.  I'll post more when I've made some progress. (and I'll have to check on Blynk!) Dave
