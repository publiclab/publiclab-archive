[@Subir](/profile/Subir) so glad you were inspired by this post and are determined to build a similar monitoring system in Pune, India. Have you had a chance to read the latest post from the bucket-monitor project? You can view it here: https://publiclab.org/notes/kgradow1/09-09-2020/a-short-list-of-community-air-guides

At this time it's mostly US focused, though we have an international example from South Africa included. I hope you find these resources helpful for your community work!
