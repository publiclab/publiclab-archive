Yes, this is the fluorescent tube [![IMG_20160209_114110_1280x720.jpg](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/014/156/medium/IMG_20160209_114110_1280x720.jpg)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/014/156/original/IMG_20160209_114110_1280x720.jpg)

As I said I've focused the webcam without the diffraction grating and slit onto a barcode ~22cm away as recommended, since it was stated that the webcam was not correctly focused as shipped (and indeed it was blurry before i started changing the focus as well). I then focused it away clockwise and counter-clockwise in small increments, with no success.
