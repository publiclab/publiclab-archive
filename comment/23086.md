Hi [@yala](/profile/yala), nice to meet you! 

I know there have been plenty of folks working on different projects relating to mesh networking (especially as they relate to decentralized data)-- you can find some links to some things that touch on aspects of mesh networking here: [https://publiclab.org/search/mesh ](https://publiclab.org/search/mesh). We also partner with [EDGI](https://envirodatagov.org/), which is an organization involved with decentralizing and archiving environmental data. 

Additionally, there are plenty of people in and around Public Lab also have a lot of experience working in spaces like those you've described. I_ personally _know more about use of mesh networks in underserved urban neigborhoods-- for example, the [Detroit Digital Community Network ](https://www.alliedmedia.org/dctp/digitalstewards), the [Red Hook Initiative](http://redhookwifi.org/) and [The Point](https://thepoint.org/) -- all organizations that partner with youth in underserved neighborhoods to set up and maintain mesh networks for use by the community.  

That said, this is a great (and nuanced!) question, and there's a lot in here! You might consider breaking this up and posting a few more questions about the different facets of your work-- that way people can respond a little more to specifics, and I'd enjoy hearing more about the project you're hoping to embark on!
