Sorry, I meant make an activity out of this, with step by step instructions and such, not one taking the next step. So, yes!

I'm hoping [@stevie](/profile/stevie) and the folks she's working with who asked us to do this test can provide some more specifics on where and how they're hoping to do this sort of thing, so we can put more details and constraints into such an activity. Anybody the things Chris mention jump out at you, Stevie?
