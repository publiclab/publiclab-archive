Well, this is a self-organizing community, so you can just start one! I think in many places it's started with a get-together event... sometimes its nice to have something hands-on to do, like balloon/kite mapping. If you want we can help set up a mailing list, something like "plots-skane@googlegroups.com"? Or a general Swedish language list?
