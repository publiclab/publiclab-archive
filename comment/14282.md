I assume the kite line sold at the KAPshop is good braided polyester. Dacron is DuPont's brand of polyester, so it does not have to be Dacron. The 90 pound line is too light to use for kite photography but might be fine for your use. KAPers generally fly with 150 to 250 pound line. The forces rarely exceed 30-40 pounds, but lots of things can weaken a single point in the line, so to use the same line for many flights it's good to start with sturdier line. It's also easier to handle. I might select 110 pound line for a triple tether on a seven foot balloon with no knowledge about who will be tying knots, handling the line, or deciding if there is too much wind. You might also decide that in some conditions one or two tethers is all you need, in which case 90 pound line will be minimal. Maybe one line should be heavier and one or two additional lines could be lighter.

Those crank winders (http://www.amazon.com/Professional-7-5-Kite-Reel-Lock/dp/B0053AU2JG)  are rather useless for kite photography because there is barely enough leverage to reel in line when there is enough wind to lift a camera.

But for balloon flying in zero wind they might make it easier on your tether sergeants.
