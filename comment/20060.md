Lamotte produces hydroponic test kit but it is over 300$ for 4 nutrients. Problem with test meant for soil is that they dont show results as ppm or mg/L but as lb/acre. 
I contacted them and asked if they can offer some kind of solution for me. I am anyway going to test Lego spectrometer with photometer reagents.
