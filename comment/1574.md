That GasBadge Plus looks great: 

> Continuous event-logging is a standard feature... Optional Cal Plus™ calibration station and Datalink accessories enable easy instrument maintenance, configuration and data downloading.

> Measuring range - 0 to 500 ppm in 0.1 ppm increments

At only $118.75, it's a great deal!
