This is related to an old lab we did in college.  Polarography using a dropping mercury electrode (DME), which is a form of voltammetry ( The potentiometer project is too, correct?).  A quick search looks like mercury might still be involved. That was from a Public Lab research note published 6 years ago.  That research note is not current, to say the least.  And using a different material like graphite (say from pencil lead) would be good for safeties sake.  Physical chemistry?  Wow. Congrats on that.
