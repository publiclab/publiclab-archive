Scenario 2 (A+ 4 hours/day w/ usb wifi)

- Uses only 1w total so 4wh/day
- [4 amp hour battery](http://www.apexbattery.com/12-volt-5-ah-security-alarm-battery-replaces.html) $8
- [5 watt solar panel](https://www.altestore.com/store/Solar-Panels/altE-5-Watt-12-Volt-Solar-Panel/p10347/) $30
- [7 amp charge controller](http://www.amazon.com/Sunforce-7-Amp-Charge-Controller/dp/B0006JO0XI) $17

Power system cost = $55
