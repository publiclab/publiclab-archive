I have worked with If-This-Then-That (IFTTT)* systems in the past, and they were simple, yet effective. A system that routinely sends text message reminders might be useful, or even a push-notification app (although I don't think people want to install yet another app). 

My advisor and I are also talking about social-sensing, something along the lines of a Facebook group (although more inclusive - and cognizant of the droves of people quitting Facebook) where the sensor-systems can post updates when something is wrong (ex: "Arrr-duino: I think my temperature sensor has failed. Could someone help figure out what's wrong?"), or when some human intervention is necessary, or even simply to convey a fun-fact (ex: "The air quality has been in the normal range all month! Much better than last month where 10/31 days saw poor air quality!"). This way, the community can be engaged and aware, and provide a support system, with more tech-minded folks helping out the ones who don't have the time/technical expertise to troubleshoot.
