Nice experiment. As I recall, white LEDs have a significant 'bump' at about 430nm, a dip at 470nm and a broad peak about 600nm so I assume the 470 bump correlates with the band of interest. What interested me is the apparent increase in signal due to adding olive oil as the plots are the difference between baseline (petri dish, no water) and adding oil (but not peanut oil) Right?. If you added water to the petri dish, does the difference show a broadband increase or just noise? Same question with adding peanut oil. Is the effect the same with another dilution fluid? (i.e. could you tell the difference if olive oil was diluted with something other than peanut oil?) Clearly, the response just outside the band has little measurable signal so the addition of olive oil does not appear to be attenuating the LEDs 470nm output. It would be interesting to understand the mechanism causing this signal increase. Cheers, Dave
