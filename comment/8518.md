Jeff:

I was pretty busy the last few days and have to admit I couldn't follow the discussion on Sreyanth's proposal to closely. But I have a long train ride planned for Sunday and will get to it.

Í totally agree with you, it doesn't make much sense to have considerable overlap between the projects and it's certainly not my intention to take away from someone. 
I can't really be concrete right here before I've read through the discussion on Sreyanth's proposal but I'll will try to update my proposal and make it more compatible with the stuff Sreyanth wants to do.

“If SWB allowed dragging in 5 bracketed photos of one spectrum and did the analysis to make one spectral graph, it would add lots of power to my workflow, and produce much higher quality spectra.” - Chris</font></p>

I couldn't have said it better my friend. That's way I would like to work on this project!

Some webcams allow for exposure adjustments from the computer. I can't speak for the webcam used in the Public Lab Spectrometers since I don't own one but it doesn't really matter anyway. There is a much more promising approach to take multiple exposures with the use of a “stepped” slit” (http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-25-2013/stepped-slit-tests)


Dave:

You are a good observer Dave. The reason why the SNR in the processed spectrum seems higher is because it's not actually the hdr spectrum but a tone mapped version. The intensity scale should be logarithmic! I've been sloppy here, sorry. I will improve this section when I'm back home on Monday.

We only need to know the relative exposure of all the images we want to merge to an hdr radiance map. With a implementation based on a “stepped slit” those relative exposures are known.
Thanks for pointing me to the research note - another thing for my train ride home ;)


Thanks again for all the feedback,

Pascal
