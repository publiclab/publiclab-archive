Short answer ... No.
Long answer ... Absolutely no!

I'll try to explain why, even though it sounds possible, the uncertainties are so large that the assumptions you'll need to make will make the answer meaningless.

The first thing to understand is that the particles in the air are **NOT** of the same size and that the range of sizes is very large ([see here for some examples](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277669794_Traffic_and_nucleation_events_as_main_sources_of_ultrafine_particles_in_high-insolation_developed_world_cities/figures)). The next thing is to remember that the *mass* of a particle is related to its **volume** which is a function of the size cubed so let's work a little example.

Let's assume that all particles are spheres and that have a density of 1g/m^3 so that one particle of a given size will weigh:

10 μm : 0.0005 μg

2.5 μm : 0.000008 μg

1 μm : 0.0000005 μg

0.1 μm : 0.0000000005 μg

So, one particle of 1 μm weights **1000** times less than a particle of 10 μm which means that if you measure a concentration of PM10 of let's say 100 μg/m^3, the number of particles in that population can be anywhere between 200 thousand and 200 million per cubic meter and without any other information you can't make the estimate any narrower.

So ... don't go down that path as you'll end up with essentially made up numbers.
