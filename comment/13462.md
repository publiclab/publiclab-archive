I have a question. Since you seem to be an 'electronics guy', is there any way to run CCTV camera as a webcam on laptop. That would help me a lot in the project. There's a (pendrive-looking) converter to convert Analogue signal of cctv to digital (readable by laptop), but thats not available in my place. Thanks.
