Oh, one more thing to think about -- will you create the ImageOverlay subclass _separately_ from the interactive code where users can distort the image with their mouse or touchscreen? It makes sense that the ImageOverlay class would be a passive, self-contained class, and you would create the interactive event handlers and manipulations as part of MapKnitter's JS code, not as a native part of the class, right?

Also, perhaps you should mention the alternative way to approach the problem -- imagePolygon -- and why you're not doing it that way. If you change your mind later, or if someone else comes along and asks, you can point them at this explanation. 

Finally - what will you call your new class? ProjectedImageOverlay? RectifiedImageOverlay? StretchedImageOverlay?

Super, thanks!
