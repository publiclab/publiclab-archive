How do you calibrate anything? I haven't figured this out yet. I don't have 3 blue wavelengths to choose from...I don't know which other green wavelength to pick. I tried though. Other spectra that I do that have blue wavelengths that show up in the ultraviolet range even though I tried to calibrate the bright Hg at 435. I don't get it. Maybe the rewritable DVD gratings that I used are off? I'm using the foldable and an iphone so I don't expect perfection but I can't even get started.
