It should be quite straight forward. My suggestion is to purchase a full spectrum converted high quality camera and add different filters for selecting desired spectral ranges. For example, you can take the "normal" picture with a IR blocking filter and then switch to an IR pass filter for the same scene, provided that the object is stationary. 

If you use a converted Nikon camera, you will have a wide selection of lens to choose from and take advantage of the autofocus and to a less degree, the auto exposure system. A full spectrum converted Nikon D70 body cost $150 on eBay.
