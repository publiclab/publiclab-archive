Thanks so much for sharing this [@StroudCenterScott](/profile/StroudCenterScott)! I had heard about the Mayfly data logger from someone who was using it to monitor a stormwater recycling system in the Great Lakes area, and am excited to learn more. 

The data portal looks really useful, too. Does it accept data from other data loggers?
