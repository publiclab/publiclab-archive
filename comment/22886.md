Maybe also: 
type of light source,
image size/resolution, 
any relevant sample treatment/preparation/suspension.

This might not be exactly the rubric we're after, but there are some guidelines about slide image data/handling [here
](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/facilities/film/Imagedata-website.pdf), which have me (a non-expert for sure) thinking about what kinds of info we might want to keep track of.
