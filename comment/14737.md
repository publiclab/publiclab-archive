Awesome, I'm glad it worked for you. I did an afternoon/overnight test and it seems reliable. 
This is the plot of the time difference between logging events. All stable except the one anomoly where the sensor got detached on the bike ride home.

And the Temp/Humidity/Battery Voltage....I am concerned about how much power the Riffle draws. I could only get the it down to about 1.5-2mA even when asleep...which isn't good at all.
