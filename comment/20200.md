Haha [@warren](/profile/warren) thanks :)

I agree, it's very similar to the plab v3! Maybe someone drew the laser cutting and the vertical slit was just a mistake.

My local electronics supplier doesn't sell CFLs anymore 🤦‍♂, so I'm now waiting for a shipment, before I can go on with testing. But here's an LED spectrum: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/139063
