I'm sorry, this got buried in my inbox ... I don't even remember seeing a notification about the original question!
The short answer is that I don't have an "off the shelf" solution but it is something that my group have been mulling over for the past few months. Purple Air says that their data is easiest seen through their map and that they often share _their_ data with researchers (I thought the data belonged to those who took the measurements but that's not the point here). So, my suggestion would be to get in touch with PurpleAir to get access to the live data.
If the folks at Mobile County have the data they want analysed at hand (offline) I'm happy to prepare some quick summaries but can't commit to a tight timeframe and my group's plans are for the next months to have something ingesting PurpleAir data.
