Thanks for sharing! I'd love to learn more about your 1 on 1 conferencing, I think it's extremely important to the success of student projects.  Do you use any templates or project tracking to facilitate these meetings? We are testing out a project tracker for an upcoming project, and I'd appreciate any tips or feedback you may have.
