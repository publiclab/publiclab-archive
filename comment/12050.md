Hi Agustin - Your second equation is one option. Another is:
(blue- (red-blue*0.8)) /(blue+(red-blue*0.8))

You can play around with the factor I added (0.8 in the example). Using a factor greater than one might make sense if the red filter is a broad band filter that includes red through the NIR. This red correction approach works better when working with raw images and in some cases it might not work well with JPEG depending on the white balance you use but it's worth playing around with it.
