I was trying to use the new  image sequencer colorbar  option and I noticed that the Import Image/add step does not load an image. I used it before to blend  images for NDVI and now I can only load one image.   Has there been any changes to the import Image code that prevents loading an image?

Thank You, I am using image sequencer from windows
