Hi, Dave - thanks as always for a thorough response. Some comments:

> However, the wide bandwidth of the LED, as opposed to the laser, is clearly a disadvantage as the 400-450nm data will be potentially corrupted by this wide signal. 

> Also note, that this plot suggests that significant current will be required which is beyond the capability of most USB ports.

I'm afraid I have to disagree here -- I've been running mine at intensities up to clipping the color channels off of my laptop at the event [@matej](/profile/matej) organized, as well as off of a 1-cell portable lithium-battery-based USB charger without issues. 

> The negative influence of the LED's broad bandwidth signal is clear. 

It doesn't seem clear to me, though. Can you elaborate? Are the plots you posted there all with LEDs? And are you primarily talking here about the overlap of the LED peak with the shorter-wavelength data from fluorescence? If so, I agree that it's a potential problem, but there's been some [good discussion here](/notes/dhaffnersr/02-23-2016/baseline-comparisons-using-09mm-slit-uv-flashlight-and-uv-laser-pointer) about using even lower wavelength LEDs to reduce overlap, and we've found affordable LEDs at 365, 385, and 395 nm. It'll be interesting to see if this addresses the overlap issue.

> What is also interesting is that the LED's spectral intensity within the fluorescence spectra, seems variable with the type of chemical. My guess is that scattering is the most likely cause since the LED source has a high dispersion (120-deg viewing angle); unlike the laser.

That is interesting! Reducing wavelength overlap would presumably reduce this issue as well. 

> the impact of the LED on the fluorescence spectra seems obvious. The fluorescence spectra are simply different; which might be related to the oil molecules being excited in different modes than those from the monochromatic laser.

I agree that the impact is pretty clear, and that they're different, but it's not clear to me whether the difference will have an effect on the relationship between spectral red-shift and oil weight. This is what I'm most interested in seeing, and I believe [@ethanbass](/profile/ethanbass) has agreed to test it out. I think you have the OTK samples as well, so if you'd like to post that too, I'm very eager to see it! A comparison of different oil weights using LED vs. laser. 

> scattering within test samples which degrades performance

Sorry, I'm not following here -- are you referring to the wavelength overlap, or another kind of degradation?

> Fluorescence spectra performance is degraded by the wide bandwidth of LEDs

The key I want to understand in your analysis is whether you are solely concerned with wavelength overlap, or if you're additionally concerned about there being a less distinct emission spectrum due to the broader wavelength of the excitation light. Wavelength overlap could be addressed with a shorter wavelength LED, but broader emission would be harder to address. That said, even that would not necessarily affect red shift, which is the metric we've been using to grade oils. It could, however, make matching based on comparison of spectrum shape more difficult, which is, I believe, the approach [@ygstcu](/profile/ygstcu) is taking. 

In conclusion, I think it's premature to say that LEDs are unsuitable, and that further research is required. 

I do think that exploring alternatives is good, however -- and 405nm laser diodes are available, which would let us put an equivalent laser to the laser pens into a more stable case such as the [cuvette frame](/tag/cuvette-frame) under development. These are harder to source for regulatory reasons, but are available at similar price points.
