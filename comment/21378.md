Hi! I had to look up "adsorb" -- (it means accumulating on the surface rather than interior) but that makes sense -- basically [@guolivar](/profile/guolivar), you're saying that water in the air sticks to the particles, making them seem bigger. Conditioning -- does this mean like drying the particles out, for this case? (which would seem to be pretty tough/complicated/expensive for a real-time monitor -- like, somehow integrating a heating element and still managing airflow...)

If it's helpful, [@guolivar](/profile/guolivar) has also posted a fantastic long note on the Purple Air: https://publiclab.org/notes/guolivar/01-08-2018/thoughts-on-low-cost-air-quality-sensors which among other things starts to address some humidity questions. 

I would guess the shape and composition of a particle would affect its tendency to adsorb water. 

Would a combination of periodic particle sample collection /paired with/ a Purple Air be a good template for examining composition when using Purple Airs? Forgive me but perhaps there's been work like this already done that someone could link to? 

Thank you! All good questions!
