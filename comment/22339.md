Abdul,
It is possible that the new lens has different coatings which alter the color balance (red:NIR). This might require an adjustment to the custom white balance setting. It might also be good to check that the same sensor is being used in the current Mobius because that could have an even greater effect on color balance. The easiest way to find a better setting is to try different ones. Try a setting with more separation between the red and blue values. The current values are  red 310, green 500, blue 700.

Your latest photo does not have enough separation between red and blue (red and NIR) to produce typical NDVI values for foliage pixels. Blue values for foliage are about 50% greater than red values:

In the photo below from [this Claytonb note](https://publiclab.org/notes/Claytonb/08-13-2016/plant-health-ndvi-white-balance), blue values are an order of magnitude greater than red values. This photo produces NDVI values for foliage in the typical range (0.3 to 0.8).

There is nothing sacred about the current white balance settings (red 310, green 500, blue 700). These were found to work acceptably with the Mobius two and a half years ago but I am not aware of any tests to see if other settings produce better results (they probably do) or whether different settings are required for different lighting conditions (they probably are).
