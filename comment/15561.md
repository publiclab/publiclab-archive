I like techniques, as vj said and - it sounds the same in many other languages: tegniek, טכניקה,  تقنية , Technik, teknîk, técnica, техника, τεχνική (Afrikaans, Arabic, Hebrew, German, Kurdish, Spanish, Russian, Greek) It doesn't work in Swahili, "mbinu", or Filipino "pamamaraan", but you can't get it all :)
