For oblique shots, there's a simple way to hang a miniball tripod head off the bottom of a pendulum.

Did you use the wire to connect the PVC to the string, or did you just run the string through the PVC on this? I don't see the wire with string wound round it. Just wondering if you were doing this on purpose, and how it went?
