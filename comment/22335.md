Abdul - it looks like the config file you're using is not set up with a corrected white balance. 

This page has the corrected WB required as Chris outlines above: https://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram-point-shoot#Installing+config+file

It also has a "good/bad" comparison photo to help people to know better if their images are properly white balanced. If there's a better place to feature that, that'd be great -- maybe on your [recently posted activity](https://publiclab.org/notes/abdul/10-21-2016/infragram-point-and-shoot-starting-instructions)?
