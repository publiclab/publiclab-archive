Hi [@Willie](/profile/Willie), thanks a lot for sharing your excellent work. I used your example sketch for my Dustduino with a ESP8266 wifi module, posting to emoncms.org, below screenshot.
I have a question related to the code; i understand how you get to countP1 and countP2, but then you relate PM10count to P2 (number > 2.5micron) - i don't understand why it is not more accurate to say that PM10count relates to P1 (number > 1micron) because PM10 should include all the particles up to 10 micron. Is there a reason you use P2 for PM10? I would not make much difference, but it seems more accurate to me.
For PM25count i understand you take P1 - P2.
Would appreciate your comment- thanks- Tom
