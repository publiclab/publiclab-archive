Not sure I got exactly what you meant.
Slit, Have you looked at the [Acetate slits from the Public lab store? ](https://publiclab.myshopify.com/collections/spectrometry/products/acetate-slit-bundle?variant=984554492)

Alternatively, you can buy one from Edmund / [Thor](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=1465) for ~250$.

You can also get grating mirrors ([reflective diffraction gratings](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=8626)) there for ~100$.
