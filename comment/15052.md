Hi [@Mathew](/profile/Mathew), thanks for commenting! When i use this term, i don't use it in reference to git. I add a second use of the word "open" in front of open source in order to highlight the need for transparent processes around contribution. Some more recent discussions with GG _et al_ have updated the idea of a single individual "maintainer" to be perhaps a small group of volunteers who would serve on a "research area review group" for a quarter. Serving on this group might also be a clearly defined way for new people or people with specific types of expertise to participate in Public Lab's open research process which hasn't previously been organized or publicly presented enough for anyone besides the main developer to really know how to get involved / contribute.

Here are some quickly sketched ideas of what a research area review group could do: 

* Read
* Tag
* Collate
* Give research publishing assistance (where more documentation is needed for a contribution to be able to enter the research stream, also where there is a mistaken method used)
* Identify what is ready to be, or needs to be, replicated:
  * “Ready-to-replicate” - this documentation is sufficient for someone to follow the instructions and achieve the results
  * “Needs-to-be-replicated” like does this work at all?
* Synthesize the research area by writing a paragraph synopsis of what progress was made in the research area. To go on top of wiki page
* Identify challenges and hanging questions
