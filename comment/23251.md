A couple ideas - what about classification (potentially as part of imagesequencer?) -- lots of interest in this for aerial photography but generally doesnt run in the browser (though see this prototype: [#clashifier](/tag/clashifier)) for quantifying land cover types. 

Second, interest point finding and matching between image pairs -- there's an issue open here and it's a very big domain:
