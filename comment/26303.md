Louisiana residents, fishers, and oil workers complained about the loss of 400-600 square miles of the Louisiana coastal marshlands. Fishers sued, but the suit was deemed too broad.  The Flood Protection Authority of Louisiana sued, and the Governor retaliated against their board. The Parishes have sued, and now Freeport MacMoran is discussing a $100 Million  settlement with Louisiana and Plaquemines Parish. Chevron has increased its philanthropic spending, likely to ease these legal pressures, as it is likely liable for billions of dollars of restoration of Louisiana marshlands (based on replacement value).
