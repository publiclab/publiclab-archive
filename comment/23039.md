Just a note that [Open Demographics](https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics), [Mozilla/diversity](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity), and others are doing great work on standardized questions...

Including this post on age/gender identity surveying:

All this is incredible and should help enormously!
