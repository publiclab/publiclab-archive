In fact, chlorophyll a has 2 peaks : the first around 430 nm and the second around 660 nm ; while chlorophyll b has also 2 peaks : the first around 445 nm and the second around 640 nm. In my spectrum, we see the first peak of chlorophyll a (~430nm) and the first peak of chlorophyll b (~445nm). 
To see the second peak of chlorphyll a and b, I should be analyse the sample with a red lamp.

My spectrometer is very basic : the light cross the sample, it strike on a fragment of DVD (that decompose the light in its constituents) and a webcam (attached against the DVD fragment) capture the spectrum :
