Hi, just for starters there are a couple interesting projects related to nitrate detection here: 

https://publiclab.org/tag/nitrate

There's also this related question: https://publiclab.org/questions/winsorje/03-24-2017/nitrogenous-waste-sensors-for-24-7-monitoring

This page https://publiclab.org/wiki/nitrate-detection

But this seems the most promising!! --  https://publiclab.org/notes/Frikkie/03-05-2015/multi-parameter-analysis-using-a-diy-spectrometer
