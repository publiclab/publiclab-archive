Definitely on question number 3, the US Coast Guard has no "Chris Code" or "NCC"  for reports of "pellet"s.

Many reports we do see are associated with required reports on rail accidents, rather than a spill per se.

So I'm unsure if there's a specific threshold amount that is required, so the US Coast Guard reports we do see, like here, I feel we are lucky that the worker felt it important enough to mention a weight, which I am sure he just guesstimated :

Report Description
THE RP IS REPORTING A RELEASE OF PLASTIC PELLETS, SOURCE AND CAUSE ARE CURRENTLY UNDETERMINED. RP STATED THE PRODUCT WAS DISCOVERED ON THE BALLAST IN A RAILYARD. **ESTIMATED VOLUME IS 150 POUNDS

"pellets" seems to be the corporate and regulatory name for "nurdles."

150 pounds of pellets is about three bags, or over a 300,000 pellets, for sure
