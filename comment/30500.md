There is such concern for the invasion of the Burmese python in the Florida Everglades because, when there is the introduction of an invasive species, it puts populations of native species at risk of becoming extinct. Also, other regions with the potential of having a Burmese python invasion include southern states like Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and even us in Louisiana. There is a potential for their populations to explode in the south U.S. because we have a similar climate to their home region of south Asia. This is very bad because they can destroy ecosystems all across the South if they spread, as well as putting us in danger.
