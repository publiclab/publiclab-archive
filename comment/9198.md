This is a well written summary, Anish.

[@eustatic](/profile/eustatic) There is a logic to the distortion. As Anish said, the end result of these affine transformations looks like a projective distortion. The projective distortion is the logic. It is a specific kind of distortion that is calculated, in this case, given the four control points.

I think it is implied in step 3 that the control points drive the projective distortion, but that fact could be made more clear.
