Hi [@LaPa](/profile/LaPa),

1) just wondering which steps you followed to setup and run ImageJ and Fiji in your Raspberry Pi, and get the NDVI images.
I am following this indications of ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Raspberry_Pi) but documentation is quite shallow.
2) Also, did you reach a good end with this project, getting useful NDVI data? was it helpful to detect plant health?

Any clues? Thanks.
