Intrigued by this potential scientific Gowanus research topic ? 
(The Spatial Prevalence of Fast Repetitive Tick (FRT) among Gowanus Fundulus)  See:

This tongue in cheek research raises a more serious topic: 

How can water quality data spatial fluctuations help EPA Ecosystem Rehabilitation experts prioritize parts of the Canal for wetland and marine habitat improvements ?
