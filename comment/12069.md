Great idea - i have just created an icon that goes directly to publiclab.org/post. I will give that a shot for a while and report back. One thing i will keep an eye on is how often (every time? every day?) i have to log in, because logging in on mobile is not so fun, compared to emailing in which presumably would somehow already be connected to my PL account.
