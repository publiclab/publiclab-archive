Hi [@christie_reni](/profile/christie_reni) - this is cool to learn! I also started as a front-end developer with a remote position (freelancing, actually). I started programming more seriously through WordPress and PHP, and then found Ruby and JavaScript. Curiosity is definitely how I expand my skills! Thanks for sharing!!!
