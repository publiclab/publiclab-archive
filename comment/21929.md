The calibration coefficients are, in the simplest case, the slope and y-intercept of the linear regression line for wavelength (based on calibration targets) vs RAW pixel values. Some plots are in this note: https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/06-23-2014/calibrating-raw-images-a-step-toward-jpeg-calibration

It would be good for you to collect data at least once where you use the calibration panels each time you change the imaging geometry or lighting conditions. You should find that the slope of the linear regression line does not change much but the y-intercept does.If that is the case then you only need to photograph one tile each time the geometry and lighting conditions change.

If you have access to a spectrometer you should test the different materials to see what the reflectance is like in different wavelengths. To test for spectral vs diffuse reflectance properties you can set up an experiment where you change the geometry of the light source and/or spectrometer detector to see how much those changes effect the radiance from the targets. If you do a search for bidirectional reflectance measurements or BRDF you can see how researchers typically do these sorts of measurements.
