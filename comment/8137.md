Hi  borsaci, I have been working on the CCD spectrometer mentioned in the link above. I have made some improvements since I posted that note and am hoping to post the updated work soon. As far as interfacing with a computer, I have been using a Stellaris Launchpad microcontroller from TI (~$13) and a GUI made in Processing (processing.org). If you think I may be of some help you can email me at benjaminhickman@hotmail.com.
