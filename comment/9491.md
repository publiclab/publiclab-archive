I think those  cheap riffle crickets  would be great!   Can we set a time and date to meet and test deploy one or more?

 One assumes the 'seeps' where leachates rise to the surface  would be logical locations; These are adjacent to where old reports describe different acid spills from railcar overfilling or spilling  down the decades into the stockpiled waste There are also other sites along the near mile of company shore  below the waste  bluff where retired workers have described apparently illicit acid tank rinsings into a ditch heading directly to the beach.

A logistical challenge has emerged. The nervous company has invoked its property rights over part of the mudflats and threatens arrest for criminal trespass if we're "caught" taking mud samples from or applying sensors to "their" mud. They use video cameras and company security to enforce it.   I'm sure this only applies to myself and perhaps one other person, but will talk with the local police chief to clarify this.

Yesterday during  our weekly visit to the site we tested  whether GAC would honor  the Public Trust rights of "fishing fowling and navigation" on their beach  by going mackerel jigging and minnow trapping there.  They did - we'd informed them ahead of time and arrived brandishing fishing rods and a minnow trap. The onshore wind made the shallow water too opaque and gritty for the mummichogs and silversides - and mackerel couldn't see the lure, if any were about. Company security guy was content to site in his truck and watch 

But they do have  a guy who walks the shore daily  to pick up some of the most egregious industrial junk that has eroded onto their beach that day,  I suspect he would collect the crickets too! -  unless they were disguised as lumps of stone or wood as the flat is riddled with those. 

So cheap riffle crickets  would be great!   Can we set a time and date to meet and test deploy one or more crickets!  The company owns only a limited portion of the cove; see image with  company land bundaries. The state of Maine owns some and there's a third private shoreowner owner.  The GAC wastes don't recognize  real estate boundaries.

 But if I'd pulled out a pH meter.....
