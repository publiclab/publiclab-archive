Hi, this is excellent, thanks! Would you be willing to post it as a "replication" using the button above: `Document your attempt to build this` ? That way in the listing on https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry#Upgrades, it's shown as having a replication? 

We could also mark it as a replication of [this post on the stability upgrade](https://publiclab.org/notes/stoft/09-16-2016/stability-upgrade-mockup-for-plab-spectrometer-3-0), once it's up - i'm happy to help with that.
