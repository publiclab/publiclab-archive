Hi [@lukoyedith](/profile/lukoyedith) - I really appreciate the detailed work you've done to imagine this feature. It has a lot of potential power. But i do want to echo Ruth in noting that we have a broader collection of tasks in both of our project descriptions as we link to from https://publiclab.org/notes/cess/04-04-2021/call-for-proposals-outreachy-summer-2021 -- and we are really prioritizing these project scopes for this round. Your project seems really carefully thought through and I think it looks great, but I want to encourage you to modify your proposal to encompass more of the scope of the posted projects. 

Thanks so much for the time you've put in on this and I appreciate your proposal!!!
