Just a follow-up on this for when we take it on -- the full set of results (the typeahead dropdown results only show a subset) for `Water Quality Testing At Turkey Creek` was this:

For reference, this is the actual post: https://publiclab.org/notes/Delaney/05-04-2018/water-quality-testing-at-turkey-creek

The query was: https://publiclab.org/api/srch/all?query=Water%20Quality%20Testing%20At%20Turkey%20Creek

Not even this query returns it -- odd! https://publiclab.org/api/srch/all?query=Water%20Quality%20Testing

This one is a bit mysterious, to be honest...
