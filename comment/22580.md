They note shortcomings in CTEH's (a contractor) sampling protocols when compared to the EPA's recommended protocols.

Excerpts:

> Much of the oil from Murphy’s tank went into the surrounding neighborhoods.
> The Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health (CTEH) is a contractor hired by Murphy Oil in the aftermath of one of the worst oil spills in history.3 CTEH is the company that Murphy has paid to take soil samples in the area of the oil spill.
> This exposé details a number of disturbing facts about CTEH, but the bottom line for people affected by the oil spill in St. Bernard Parish is this:
> 1. Murphy is not acting in good faith: By hiring a seemingly notorious company like CTEH and passing CTEH off as an objective, independent third party looking out for the public good, Murphy is violating the trust of its neighbors, many of whom believed Murphy was acting in good faith when they agreed to settle with the company.
> 2. The results of Murphy’s soil samples appear to be questionable: CTEH’s sampling protocol and practice give reason to doubt the results of Murphy’s samples and Murphy’s assurances to the public
