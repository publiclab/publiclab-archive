[@stoft](/profile/stoft) -- your wooden baffle shown in the main body of the question is abotu 1" away from the webcam -- any comments on placement? And, does it matter if the baffle is not as rigid as the rest of the optics -- I suppose it could cause slight variance in background light levels if it's not completely rigid, so I could try making another "stand" from three more wooden blocks, then re-use the black card paper? (interested in re-use because those pieces are cut on the same die as the spec kit, so every kit owner will have them already). Thanks!
