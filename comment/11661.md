i actually have three of those pumps on my desk. they have a counter up to 10 and a thermal ring (that doesn't appear to work) for temp and a tube tip breaker (a glass tip is stuck in one of them). I think they work best at high levels. The tubes that go with those pumps have a higher (10x higher than our tubes). I think the larger volumes of air work better for lower levels. 

I totally agree that we are looking at a balance of cost an automation. we also want to make sure people are getting the most robust data that we can give them and to make every test as similar to the next test as possible. how to we demonstrate trust in the capacity of non-scientists that the chain of custody system so thoroughly disregards while also encouraging consistency and validity? we could have some kits with the auto shut off and some with just a timer and see how their levels compare? 

I think people will be pretty good at unplugging their kit right on time, its something that you don't do everyday (like cooking or running the dishwasher) so I think people are pretty attentive to it. We can also get very bold and underline-y in the instructions about the timing.
