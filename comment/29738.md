Answering/Responding to:
"Why 99% of Ocean plastic pollution is "missing"'
The video explains that scientists once believed that the majority of the Earth's ocean plastic was located in garbage patches. Garbage patches are places in the ocean where plastic has built up as a result of tide and flow trends in our oceans. Once truly researched, scientists found that the surface of these patches only held about one percent of all oceanic plastic pollution. After analyzing samples, scientist discovered that the plastic they found was really old plastic. Therefore the question of where more current pollution has gone arose. It has been determined that majority of the newer plastics stay around and on our shores. Here, the macro-plastics are exposed to a lot of rubbing, moving, and scraping. These activities create an abundance of microplastics. The four places that the video determined our missing oceanic plastics lie are the garbage patches, on the seafloor, sinking in the ocean, and close to and on our shores.
