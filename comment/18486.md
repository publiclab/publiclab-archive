A single camera NDVI system with a red filter should produce a photo with very turquoise foliage. The blue channel (NIR) should be much brighter than the red channel (red). Your photo has a brighter red channel, so NDVI values will not be in the standard range.

If most of the light was artificial, that could account for some of the lack of NIR brightness. I guess some fancy window glass could also block some NIR. But if you can't do a custom white balance, a jpg photo will never be directly convertible to meaningful NDVI. The custom white balance multiplies the values in the blue channel by 2 or 3. Without that adjustment, your only hope might be to capture RAW image files and do the adjustment afterwards. I have never managed to get meaningful NDVI from a jpg photo unless a custom white balance was used.
