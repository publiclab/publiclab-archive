Hi! Great work here. As for the voting up an answer, technically, I'm not much help, but in terms of looking at this from a user perspective, I really like the idea. It's a natural process for social/online interface. It could help people get the answers they are looking for more quickly and it provides a way for new users to comment in right away ("which was the most helpful answer"), a nice task for new users. On the other hand, it can encourage people who answer to really develop a solid response so theirs would be voted up. +1
