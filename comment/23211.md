As for what method can do soil, paint, water, etc.  Edxrf has a big problem with water.  Water absorbs xrays.  You can get around this by evaporating the water, if you want.  It's advantage is in paint and dust analysis. Lead shows up well in by edxrf.  I was analyzing soot dust from a natural gas heated plant and found some strange elements (radioactive ones from natural gas).  

One the other hand, for most environmental work, ICP-MS , is a much better way to go.  It is just much more expensive and takes extensive training.
