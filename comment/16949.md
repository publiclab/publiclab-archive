[@shanlter](/profile/shanlter) using 2 arduino (or 20) doesn't change anything, unless you use galvanically isulated ac/dc converter.

if you power them from the same source, you got interference in any case. Of course you can power them with 2 different batteries, but you have to handle a lot of different wire.


for the EC, no, i don't use the one from dfrobot.
i use this 
https://github.com/cyberplantru/EC-mini-v31-hardware/blob/master/EC_mini_v31.pdf
it's very simple to do made and work decently.

what's the K(cell constant) of the dfrobot probe?
i use mine on saltwater aquarium, my target it's 53.065 mS/cm
