hey jeff, NaOH3, is used as a regent for fluorescein because of the Ph level of 8.44, which at that level free's up more hydrogen bonds causing a higher energy state. Also it's the standard regent for fluorescein, but I just wanted to let you know why it works.

The purpose of a gain medium is tuning of primarily of a laser source at a specific wavelength, but I found it useful as a tracer in very small concentrations in order to increase the intensity of the fluorescing material, no it does not react in anyway on a molecular level with the sample, bonding to the substance is just my musings into this possibility. 

If you keep the concentration of the fluorescein at the same level as the sample it won't drown out the sample data, but you'll be able to "see" it more clearly after data capture.

This is the source for all my chemicals, www.consolidated-chemical.com, including the fluorescein.

I have a lot of data on all my research, I only post some of it, it would be a little much if I posted it all at once, so I try and string it out, but I'm doing research everyday, I love it.
