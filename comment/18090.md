Hi! Happy New Year! We here in Ukraine continue to work on DIY small aerostats/balloons  for ecological mapping. Unfortunately, we have here in East Ukraine now one more potential area for balloon mapping - i.e. landmine clearance. 
Also we've cooperated with U.S. aviation historian in research of our Ukrainian airship history -- 120 years ago Dr. Konstantin Danilewsky flew his man-powered airships in Kharkiv, East Ukraine. This historic study is published at https://welweb.org/ThenandNow/Danilewsky.html
