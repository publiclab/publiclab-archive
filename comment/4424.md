Thanks for your feedback, cfastie.

We mention in our analysis section that the pictured beverage samples are,
 from top to bottom, Redbull, Monster, and Neurosonic. Including the order of the pictured drinks in the caption would be useful. We'll play around with it.

The calibration software is a bit subpar, at least in our experience. We tried 
re-calibrating the spectra numerous times but were never able to align all three spectra
properly. However, it seems obvious to us that with proper calibration the intensities will align 
as they should. There is clearly room for some improvement in this regard.
