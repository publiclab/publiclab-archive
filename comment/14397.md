[@cfaste](/profile/cfaste) does have some good points; clear rank topics, finite review period and minimum rank numbers in some form. I'd also agree that pitfalls are difficult to avoid with any system. However, I think the large number of existing notes also needs to be considered. If the 'members at large' are expected to somehow 'promote' candidates, it is unlikely that random process will comb the entire database of material. That is, in part, why I suggested creating a 'selection bucket' or 'pool' of possible notes to consider. Searching for potential candidates is probably a more efficient process than doing reviews. Perhaps anyone could select any note for inclusion in the pool (with the promoter's name attached). This way, there would likely be a more reasonable subset to review and there would be a specific place to browse for candidates to read, review and rank.

One other thought triggered by these comments is that if a reviewer gave a rank of 3+, a brief comment (as to why the note should pass review) must be included otherwise it is too easy to just check boxes without real justification.
