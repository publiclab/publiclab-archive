Another way to approach this is to standardize everything as much as possible, so it follows a well-described, simple, standard process, which we could give a catchy name like "**Infrablue Method [#1](/n/1)**"

It may be early to decide on a standard, but it could perhaps be a starting point -- i.e. if you vary one of the steps, you only have to describe the step you varied, rather than your whole setup. This wouldn't work for, say, camera model, but we could standardize camera settings to a large degree, filter choice, and processing. And tell people to only vary one parameter at a time if possible.
