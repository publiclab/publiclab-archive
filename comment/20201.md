This looks awesome. Just a quick note that this repository can do the extraction of cross section locally:
  

[https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js/)  

  

Also, [@MaggPi](/profile/MaggPi) has developed some excellent scripts for doing this as well, I believe!

I want to share my ideas already now, so I can get your input early on and still have time to order parts if needed. Please note that this is a project mainly for fun and not scientific accuracy, so sorry if it might seem a bit messy ;)
