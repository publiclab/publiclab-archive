Great project.  I want to encourage you to continue.  I wouldn't worry too much about the cost, Are you posting your notes and code anywhere?  As you pointed out, Lidar would be the next obvious step.   I work in environmental science in Alaska and this capability is way out of reach unless we are on a government or industry project.  My current interest would be to use it to map proposed mine sites and surroundings to determine environmental impacts.  We need it - keep it up!
