Posting the correction file and Solux published spectrum that Dave sent me here:

I'm just checking on this, but I believe we've changed the camera shipping in the desktop kit, which is one reason I'm interested in the process you used to **generate** the correction file, so it can be reproduced for any given camera. Just to re-state your 7 step process above in pseudocode:

<pre>
// data from .txt file, captured from Solux website, in [nanometer wavelength, percent intensity]:
var published_solux_spectrum = [[280, 0.049379], [290, 0.075516], ... ];

// data from a Public Lab Desktop Spectrometer v3 with a given webcam, in [nanometer wavelength, percent intensity]:
var measured_solux_spectrum = [[280, 0.049379], [290, 0.075516], ... ];

var correction = [];

measured_solux_spectrum.forEach(function(pixel, index) {

  var ratio = published_solux_spectrum[index][1] / pixel[1], // <= here we really need to match wavelengths, but for purposes of terseness in this pseudocode, we'll assume they're matched
       pair = [ pixel[0], ratio ]; // reformat into [wavelength, ratio]

  correction.push(pair);

});

return correction;
</pre>

Here I've skipped the "roll-off", although I agree we should do that. I just want to separate out the steps. Once this part is figured out, I have some questions about the roll-off. How does the above look?
