> Justin, i did see it, but did get an error lately on your map Harvey Ecological hazards https://goo.gl/maps/roFtd9S3pgP2

> Landfills are importnt to track, especially < a month from now, when nasty new landfills will spring up. we've got to be in communication with Lone Star Sierra Club about that, since i don't know how TCEQ will announce the new landfills.

> We at GRN made a similar map for our internal planning, but also for public consumption: https://gulfwetlandsmap.carto.com/viz/06bb2c4a-89d2-11e7-8a08-0ee462b5436c/public_map We pulled our data from Climate Central's report on EPA data.

> Sierra Club has a good map of facilities in TX as well: http://www.sierraclub.org/environmental-justice/hurricane-harvey-toxic-sites

> for pollution reports, Skytruth has an NRC tracker: http://alerts.skytruth.org/
