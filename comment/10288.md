Hey [@warren](/profile/warren) [@donblair](/profile/donblair) and Katie - Nice work - this is simple and exciting.  
we did a home brewed test of Coquí here last weekend with hot/cold water, 2 kids and a Yoda Angry Bird:

Our judgement was that the sounds were "the same but different" and that both hot and cold "vibrated a lot".
