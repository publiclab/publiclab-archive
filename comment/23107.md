Hi [@pfhs](/profile/pfhs) thanks for reaching out! The 5' balloon should be fine for two days of use, without re-inflation, but will have diminishing returns after that. The mylar balloons will generally stay buoyant for 3-5 days, and should stay usable for at least a few days after that (with diminishing lift). The classic kit will let you fly higher and carry heavier cameras, while the mylar balloons will be easier to move (you won't be able to get the inflated 5' balloons into the back of a car, for example, or through a standard door). If either version of the kit seems doable from a practical standpoint, you might want to think about what kinds of images you're hoping to collect: with the classic neoprene kit you can fly higher (and therefore capture a larger field of view), and have more flexibility to use heavier/higher quality cameras, while the mini-kit is a little more portable and may give you all of the height/lift that you need if you're planning to work at a lower altitude.  

Does this answer your question? We'd love to hear more about what you're planning!
