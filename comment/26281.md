I have a few scientific paper to share with you.

This paper says that salt can be used to inactivate virus on surgical mask. 
https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39956

This paper says that surgical masks are as effective as the more expansive options like N95 masks in terms of preventing influenza.

Ｉthink a big problem with surgical masks is that there is usually a big hole on either side of mouth. To minimize these holes,  one can pinch up the rim of the mask where the holes are . Then one can use a stapler to staple the pinched rim together.
