I have a few scientific paper to share with you.

This paper says that salt can be used to inactivate virus on surgical mask.

This paper says that surgical masks are as effective as the more expansive options like N95 masks in terms of preventing influenza.

ï¼©think a big problem with surgical masks is that there is usually a big hole on either side of mouth. To minimize these holes,  one can pinch up the rim of the mask where the holes are . Then one can use a stapler to staple the pinched rim together.
