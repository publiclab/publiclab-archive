 This may be OBE but Hufkens has posted files of the PI response curves: 

https://khufkens.github.io/pi-camera-response-curves/

which were  also referenced here:

I am not familiar with your project to understand all the issues  but one way to avoid the 60 Hz flicker issue (even though I am not certain it is an issue) is to use an LED source.
