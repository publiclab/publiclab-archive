 This may be OBE but Hufkens has posted files of the PI response curves: 

https://khufkens.github.io/pi-camera-response-curves/

which were  also referenced here: 

https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/06-17-2018/how-can-you-use-computer-vision-to-reduce-spectral-overlap

I am not familiar with your project to understand all the issues  but one way to avoid the 60 Hz flicker issue (even though I am not certain it is an issue) is to use an LED source.
