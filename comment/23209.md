Read- ICP-MS is the premier method.no doubt.  But you pay for it.  I'm second place is ICP-OES (ICP-optical emission spectrometry).  Pretty much the same thing you call ICP-AES.  Third place for me was GFAA (graphite furnace AA). You could get an adapter for an AA to convert it to GFAA.  It still gave ppb resolution, but cost was between ICP and AA.  Flame AA ( it can also do AE) is still popular.  It is required for many methods.  

The microwave methods weren't popular when I retired.  Maybe they are now.  As for XRF, there are two base methods, EDXRF and WDXRF.  You want to go with EDXRF under most situations.  WDXRF has many more regulatory requirements.  More to follow...
