[@win215](/profile/win215) Thank you for your input, I just received the grating slides and I'll dismantle a DVD or two and do a comparison when I finish the spectrometer build (kit ordered).
I'm making an integrating sphere: I want to test a large quantity of BR30 light bulbs (mostly LED, but some incandescent), measuring color temperature and matching the bulbs up is the immediate goal.
Thank you for providing the "science behind the grating."
