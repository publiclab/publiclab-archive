Every year, between 200 and 2,000 species go extinct. This is because our environment is constantly changing around us. For example, in Florida, the Burmese python is an invasive species brought over from southeast Asia, and it has taken over the local ecosystems. This has put animals such as racoons, foxes, rabbits, and even birds like wood storks at risk of endangerment. The Burmese python was able to thrive in the Florida ecosystems because of its size, weight, and stealth. This made it into a major threat to local wildlife.

Direct human impacts can also threaten the ecosystems. For example, we use pesticides to control pests, but it has adverse effects on others as well. Also, our pollution gets into the environment. The Nashville crayfish is an example of a species that was threatened because of pollution in its natural habitat. While they are no longer threatened, bald eagles were once in danger of endangerment due to misuse of pesticides. Our impacts on the environment affect everyone, not just us.
