For [#4](/n/4)-6, I'm not sure I agree. The rigidity of the attachment of the Oil Testing Kit to the spectrometer itself only has an effect on amplitude, as you point out. But we already use an attenuator based on a design you proposed -- printed on acetate:

![attenuator](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/506/medium/IMG_20150407_150502-2.jpg)

And in our analysis, as I [went through on Monday](/notes/warren/07-14-2015/testing-the-oil-testing-kit-identifying-a-somewhat-unknown-sample), we use macros in Spectral Workbench to equalize the height for comparison. And we haven't fully explored the differing total amount of fluorescence produced by different oils or different concentrations. Not to mention possible variability in laser intensity. (Note the links in my Monday post to our work on equalizing curve height and area)

So with several different ways that amplitude is already varied, and that we work to equalize amplitude in software, I'm just not persuaded the rigidity of the attachment itself is having a critical effect on the kinds of oil comparisons we're doing. How would you propose to test that out?
