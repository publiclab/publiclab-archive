Hi Thorsten,

Glad to hear you're making progress. When you run the plugin are you specifying that the channel from the visible image to use for the red band is "red" and the channel from the IR image to use for the IR band is "blue"? You can use other channels for the IR image but I think most people use the blue band. You can try others channels and see what works best for you. If you are using these settings make sure you are not mixing up the visible and NIR images.

Thanks for letting me know about the missing xmpcore.jar file. I posted it to the GitHub site so it should be there now. If you need to you should be able to get the zip file from here:http://code.google.com/p/metadata-extractor/downloads/list
