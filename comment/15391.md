I think the main challenges are:

* whether moving/tugging the cable moves the webcam at all
* whether twisting the spectrometer (now that it's not as rigid) will change your readings

Both of these would need to be tested -- preferably in some standard way we could outline here, stepwise, so that others can try them out. Thanks!!
