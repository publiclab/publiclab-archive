Oh, and is the 14CFLpeaks.txt from the Wikipedia reference? If so, it says:

> Spectrum with peaks labelled taken with an Ocean Optics HR2000 spectrometer [1] of ambient light provided by fluorescent lamps. Spectrum taken by me (apparently en:user:Deglr6328). The spectrometer appears to be about ~.6 to .8 nm off judging from the location of known peaks. Interpretation of spectral peaks has been done using the NIST database of spectra for mercury [2] and an article on fluorescent light phosphors [3]. This spectrum is not calibrated for intensity.

Which should still be OK as a reference. Although if all 14 are available at http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html, we could just use those.
