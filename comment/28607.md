That clarifies things a lots.

I understand the main issue is that we don't have an efficient database setup for geographic data.

I came across [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) which is a spatial database extender for PostgreSQL. Or we can extend our existing database since MySQL supports spatial data types (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/spatial-types.html), we will have to way in pros and cons here. 

Using a specialized database solves many of our problems like,
- Indexing, https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/indexing.html most of these databases have an efficient spatial indexing already in place
- Boundary Box Queries, https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Within.html and https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Contains.html are specialized geometry based queries ( boundary box in our case ) which have indexing automatically ( unless we specify other wise )

As you mentioned, Node.Js can be used for providing the interface on top of the database and greatly comfortable with the stack.


As for scraping and storing the data,
We can provide some endpoint like
`/create-map-data` - which serves the purpose of providing interface for storing data directly into this database whenever a relevant node is created. As you already mentioned we will have to weigh in the pros/cons here.
