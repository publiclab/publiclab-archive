Dear Warren,

This is the first version of GoPro Hero HD without screen not Hero 2 (although it looks quite similar). Yeah the lens is fixed (no any way to open the lens) . In order, to open it the only option i have is to cut the lens with a dremel. But i am confused on which part to cut in the lens .
I have attached the picture of the lens so you can see how it looks like and could potentially give me an idea.

Thank you so much for your reply. I highly appreciate it.

Best Regards,

Suman
