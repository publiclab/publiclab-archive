I bought and tried a 50ml pipette and made a [dropout jar](/notes/nshapiro/11-03-2014/diy-formaldehyde-test-kit#c10686).

The jar kind of works-- some condensation still seems to get through, but never bubbles.  

The 50ml pipette is very difficult to use, as I expected, the size makes measurement hard because the bubble moves too fast.

 it also requires a stand, takes too long to attach and detach to wet, and is hard to clean.  A 100ml model would only solve a few of these issues-- and I can't find anything larger than that.
