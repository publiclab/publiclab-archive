Looking forward to this!!! I'm interested in perhaps doing a session on the "lifecycle" of a monitoring technique, from prototyping to community-building and testing, and identifying parts and writing guides, and developing a peer support network around them, as well as a place to share data. Could start with a rough diagram walking through a project like the [Community Microscope](/micro) and then brainstorm/discuss/expand out from there. Would that be of interest to folks?
