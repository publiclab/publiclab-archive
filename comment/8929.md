This is excellent research. Do you think if I bought some "100% extra virgin olive oil" and sent you a sample, you could tell me if it was really 100%? I guess in order to do that, we would need a database of systematically collected spectra of oils that are known to be 100% extra virgin olive oil. But how do we even know that our control oils are 100%?    We need to know someone down on the oil farm.
