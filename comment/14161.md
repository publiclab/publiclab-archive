The daffodil spectra are great lessons. It's very unusual to see much yellow in the photos of diffraction patterns from Public Lab spectrometers. That's probably because consumer cameras don't have yellow sensors, only R, G, and B. To figure out how much yellow is hitting a pixel, the camera's computer uses the brightness of the red and green sensors and applies a rule to make up a number for how much yellow there is. When there is lots of yellow (like in a daffodil) the rule gets it right, but it seems that the yellow part of spectra (around 600 nm) of white light sources is often represented by a low area. That dip is right where the sensitivities of the red and green sensors overlap. The rule must be a little stingy when it comes to assigning yellow to pixels.

In general, using a Public Lab spectrometer to learn about the color of reflected light requires great care. In an ideal Public Lab laboratory, the light source for these observations would have a spectrum  like this:

The material used to make the diffraction grating would have a transmittance spectrum like this: 

[![100_.JPG](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/465/large/100_.JPG)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/465/original/100_.JPG)

The lens of the camera would have a transmittance spectrum like this: 

[![100_.JPG](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/465/large/100_.JPG)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/465/original/100_.JPG)

And the camera sensor would have sensitivity like this:

 [![100_.JPG](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/465/large/100_.JPG)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/465/original/100_.JPG)

The actual curves for all of those things are not even close to straight lines. To interpret the reflectance results from a Public Lab spectrometer, you have to know how each of the actual curves deviate from the perfect curves. Then you also must know how the color image of the diffraction pattern is being processed to make a jpeg photo or video frame. All I know is that's a lot of things to know.
