Hi. I recently purchased an "infragram plant cam" and am finding myself confused (a common phenomenon). So, I take an image and read it in to Octave or Matlab and get three channels corresponding to R, G and B but the channels are actually corresponding to NIR R and G?  Then when I calculate NDVI the formula is actually (NIR-G)/(NIR+G), correct?
