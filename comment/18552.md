I'm glad you brought this up, [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n)! [@Mathew](/profile/Mathew) did some work with polarimetry too. See this research note: https://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/05-21-2014/imagining-testing-polarized-light-microscopy-for-silica-dust-speciation. I wonder if we could first identify jagged particles in the >5um size range, and then, if we do see jagged particles, do a quick polarimetry setup like Mathew did to see if they refract light.
