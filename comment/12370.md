[@kkoerner](/profile/kkoerner) Hi Karl! Great find! It would be fantastic if you could request a quote on these. We are planning on have a lending library of these tools that would be shipped around between people needing formaldehyde testing so over time the shipping costs will really add up and weight saving would save the community a good amount of money. 

[@mathew](/profile/mathew) might also be interested in Karl's pumps as he has really taken the lead on the lending kits.
