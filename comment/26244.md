The U.S. Maintains a snotel (snow telemetry) network.  These are stations that monitor the snow depth and then forward that data,  daily, by means of meteor scatter.  I couldn't find a description of how the sensors work, but it might be a good place to start.  Maybe send the  contact an email after reading up on snotel.
