PVC pipe works well.  What are you using exactly--can you post a photo?  

For PVC, you can choose whatever diameter pipe you need then glue a cap on one end and a threaded fitting on the other for a removable screw cap or plug.  You can get dye-free PVC primer that will remove the ink stamp on PVC as well as prep the ends for gluing without making dye marks (see http://www.mcmaster.com/#pvc-glue/=ukjt49 ).  If needed, you can use anti seize compound, teflon tape and/or dow corning high vacuum grease on the threaded cap or plug if it proves difficult to remove.

Aside from DIY, the gold standard of instrument cases is probably the Pelican case, available in a variety of sizes.  I wouldn't use it as a buoy but they're used for all sorts of outdoor instruments.  I have a small one I take kayaking to keep my cell and wallet dry--very durable and waterproof.
