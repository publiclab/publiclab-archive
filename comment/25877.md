I did this!

My first error it was a silly mistake - the yellow/red/black cable was plugged in backwards. "apparently" it makes a difference which end goes where (this is what i get for skimming the instructions, they're very clear above)

...coffee is measured! ☕️

and -- faster blinking is high turbidity -- blocking it entirely made it blink super fast, while measuring nothing (open air) was about 1 blink per second. 

Will, i hope it's all right, i noticed a small error because the < character was clipped out in the script, so I fixed it an copied it into an Arduino Create sketch, and embedded that. I'm able to program the Micro from Arduino Create, on my chromebook, which is nice and convenient!
