Yes, you should be able to -- see the sidebar where the images are listed and it should show a button if it can detect EXIF GPS tags! This one doesn't show it but if your image has these tags, it should work:

We are also working on an improved means of doing this (a better UI, better placement) in an upcoming version. Thanks!
