Re: cameras, I have access to a friend's Fujifilm X100s. It has a fixed focal length, and it's easy to program the exposure settings, etc. In fact, it's a really nice camera! However, it doesn't have built-in GPS. I could probably use a phone, or handheld GPS unit instead, but this would give my location rather than the location of the camera. Alternatively I could record the GPS coordinates for my ground control points. Obviously this means that there would be fewer GPS reading as input for the photogrammetry software. What do you think? Should I use a really nice camera without GPS, or try to beg / borrow one that does?

P.S. Collecting these data is just one small step towards graduating...
