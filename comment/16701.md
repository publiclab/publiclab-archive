You're right I had a typo-- I should have deleted the PM2.5 field. fixed, thanks.

The mine was operational, and they were not loading rail cars, but the facility we visited was loading trucks.

Our windspeed measurements were inconclusive because of the calm conditions, so we largely only recorded the direction.

Agreed, I'd love to hear from the other participants.  I hope there is a time to repeat this effort more systematically.  The documentation here is to accompany the pDR-1500 as a device available on-loan to whomever wants to use it.
