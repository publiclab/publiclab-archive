Hi

I am trying to process two images in Fiji, one raw infrared, one visible spectrum. When choosing the two image files from which to create a text file the software completes the task but the resulting text file which should contain the path to the two images is blank. The files are independently stored in two different folder as described in the Fiji tutorial. I suspect it may be because I have downloaded these two images from the internet and the metadata has been stripped out. I don't yet have my IR camera up and running which is why I am using downloaded images.

Any help would be much appreciated.

Thank you.
