Hi [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n), I just now responded to this question in your other question thread. The validation work is being conducted at BEESL at Syracuse University. I'll ask if the exact protocol can be made public. I do know that it involves building an airtight exposure chamber, and introducing known concentrations of formaldehyde and other co-contaminants like acetone, acetaldehyde, and maybe acetonitrile into the chamber to assess the response of the badge, and of the app in reading the badge.
