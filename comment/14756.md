Great discussion and a lot of good ideas. The AQ-SPEC group (www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec) has published results on several PM sensors other than the Dylos. Particularly interesting is the performance of the "Purple Air" sensor ($150/unit) and the widely used Alphasense OPC-N2 monitor (which provides 3 size fractions and 16 size bins). I am personally more familiar w/ the hardware than the software (just stare using the RPi) and would be more than willing to collaborate with people that have good ideas on how to build a small sensor network. I have been looking into AWS IoT and products like Splunk for structuring, sorting, and plotting sensor data. Anyway...I am digressing. Great job w/ this Dylos project and keep up the good work :)
