Hello [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie), thanks for your opinion it really help us out. We are so new on this issue, as I commented you on other talk we just broke a camera trying to take out the IR filter, oh my !!.. But let me ask you something that maybe I will not understand, but what does all the mixing colors have to do in the end? and how do you do it? We use the Fiji software.  
Thanks.
