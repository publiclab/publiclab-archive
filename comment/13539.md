I figured out the problem with reprogramming -- the pin I'm using for the potentiometer is also used for USB on the Trinket. Oddly, I can get it to work if the potentiometer is turned to a middle position -- not too high or low. I think we could probably avoid this by moving it to pin [#2](/n/2), (analog 1) -- which is not also used by USB.

[Great contributions on the spec list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plots-spectrometry/7QQ7Yg_0xMw) are pointing out that we can boost the brightness with a MOSFET (IRFZ44N); I'm asking which I should order.
