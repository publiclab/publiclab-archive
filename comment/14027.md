I think it's a tough call. I see benefits to both -- how consistent can we make the interface between Ransack and Sunspot? Could we standardize it enough that either could be used? That is, not do double the work, but architect it so that although we work in Ransack, a swap to Sunspot would not be too hard? 

Let's not get bogged down if that's too much to think about at the moment. But it's one option that we could keep in mind.
