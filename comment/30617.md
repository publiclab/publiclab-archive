*** Restoring Louisiana lost coast, marsh land and barrier island can cause an ecological succession!**
The barrier island playâ€™s a crucial role for the safety of Louisiana from hurricanes but restoring these barrier islands can have a negative impact on the fishing industries. 
The LDWF estimates there are currently between 700 to 1,000 in the state of Louisiana.  Gulf Killifish, sheep's head minnow and oyster Killifish and diamond killifish. Brown shrimp and white shrimp. The fish that will be mostly affected by this is brown and white shrimp and all gulf, sheepshead, minnow, oyster, diamond killifish. These sea creatures will be pushed away from their home.  the state's coastal environment, which has made Louisiana second only to Alaska in domestic seafood output, be impacted by these freshly formed marshes and the rapid influx of freshwater to the coast.
