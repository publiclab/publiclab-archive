Woohoo! Mathew, this is brilliant.  Could you include a closeup shot of the gel cap w/out liquid -- or I'll just search online -- are they relatively clear?  I wonder what the optical properties are like ... looks like a really neat little mixing container in which to do colorimetry experiments, too -- collect a water sample in a larger container, then pour it out into a bunch of little gel cap 'vials' and use strips (or sub-strips) of pH testing paper, etc ... supercool!
