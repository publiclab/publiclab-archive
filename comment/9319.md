Thank you for the interesting recommendations.
 I actually just got my Mobius today and will be printing out various components for the rig.  Can you recommend a good waterproof case?  I certainly learned my lesson last time...
  I was not aware of the Bimp plugin though I use Gimp frequently.  I was very impressed with DigiKam and was going to propose a side project aimed at configuring a preset template for aerial mappers or possibly a plugin for MapMill.  But something along those lines would make much more sense for Gimp considering it has such a large user base.  Can I ask if you've tried DigiKam before?  If so how does it compare to Gimp+Bimp? 
   Have you tried Mapknitter yet?  If not I'm sure the devs would be interested in your input since you've worked with professional-level platforms. 
  Some might dismiss the need for 3D but grassroots mapping is one application where 3D could be a game changer!   It looks like Agisoft Photoscan uses some form of Computer Vision to add their 3rd dimension.  I wonder if it would be possible to do something similar with OpenCV?  Though it looks like the Agisoft Suite is proprietary?  If so their technique might be patented...
