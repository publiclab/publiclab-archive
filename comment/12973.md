Yes, a long exposure wouldn't be practical because of the instability of the platform the camera would be on (cost is also a limiting factor). My thought was to mount the camera(s) on a quad-copter with a GPS navigation unit so I can return to (close-to) the same position each time to photograph. My hope was to use a Rasberry Pi with a NOIR camera module to capture the pictures. This setup would be light enough that I could fly two cameras on the quad-copter if needed. From what you are saying, though, it sounds like such a setup may not be of sufficient quality to be helpful. As far as taking a series of photos over the growing season, I suppose, if nothing else, doing so might help identify when the NDVI pattern was most obvious. My plan was to start with a site that has known subsurface features, some of which have already been mapped, so I can compare that with the NDVI results. I agree that a time-lapse video would be a cool outcome, though might not be possible with the setup I envision.
