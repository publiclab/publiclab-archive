If you know the spectral sensitivity of each channel in the sensor in the camera you are using, you can adjust the brightness (intensity) at each wavelength based on how sensitive the sensor is. If the Raspberry Pi camera still uses this sensor, you are good to go.

Note the steep cutoff of the red channel around 580nm which you noticed in the diffraction images. The lens on the camera will alter this relationship among colors, so there will still be some guesswork unless you can quantify the characteristics of the lens. The IR cut filter will also alter this relationship.
