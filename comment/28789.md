We have obtained one trawl and are in the process of building three more. We built three BabyLeg trawls in all. One of our group members, @ brycestrada, took a trip to Bayou St. John to collect our samples. One trawl was lost in the process of collecting samples because the knot of the leash came undone. To solve this problem we put zip ties on the other two trawls to hold the ropes together. After the loss of our first trawl, another BabyLegs had to be made the day of data collection. It all ended alright, we got our samples involving: organics, bag wrappers, and other miscellaneous pieces of plastic. Two more trawls were made, but not used just so we can experience constructing BabyLegs. In conclusion, we did a good job and it was a very fun experience. Below is a link to the instructions we used to build our BabyLeg trawls if you are interested.
