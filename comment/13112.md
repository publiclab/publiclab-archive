Great work, Matej-
Do you have any thoughts on applying your research to collecting samples from frozen soil? How will frozen earth affect collecting samples?
My kit isn't here, yet, so perhaps collecting samples in advance would work. 
The ground is just starting to freeze, although, with El Nino, it's been abnormally warm & wet.
 
There is light snow cover in the Upper Midwest today-

Maybe I can collect samples now, before the kit comes? 
If the ground is frozen hard, I could try collecting soil samples by pouring warm water on it.
If that would mess up the results, please let me know.
 Many of the soils that I wish to test are mucky & slurpy, not like the beach sand demonstrated at the barnraising. Lots of colloidal suspension, I expect. The organic content of the soils may be high, too.

Thanks for your original ideas and experimental techniques.
