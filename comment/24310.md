 I really love that mesh strainer! I was also thinking about this some-- it seems like it might be reasonably easy to extend the antenna on the Raspberry Pi itself (as below):

There are external antennae for other models of the Rasp Pi, so possible sizing up would help (though we'd loose the compact size, which is really nice). That said, I am *very* interested in the parabolic extender. Let's try that!
