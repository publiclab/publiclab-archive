Hi [@warren](/profile/warren), "miscible" means it dissolves with them to create a homogenous mixture (i.e. doesn't separate out like oil and water do). Acetone is a super useful solvent in a lot of laboratory chemistry methods because it is one of a few liquids that has enough polarity to dissolve with water, and enough non-polar bonds to dissolve oils.
