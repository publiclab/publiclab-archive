Isn't stacking just like averaging, but without recompressing the data back into a 0-100% scale? Assuming that if you stacked and all 3 of the images were more than 33% bright, it would hit the 100% ceiling and overexpose, i guess?

SpectralWorkbench averages; we have talked in the past about being smart about using the RGB channels separately, but that would require either:

* an idealized "best guess" choice of where to use R, G, and B -- say, smoothly transitioning between them at equal spacing (bell curves)
* measuring the separate sensitivity of each of the R, G, B filtered pixels and making a choice based on that -- which would presumably vary a little between cameras, maybe not significantly

I'm open to either -- if you come up with a proposed way to do it, i can add an "alternate" means to extract, maybe we'd call it "enhanced" or "smart" and offer it as an option at the moment of capture. We could start by making a macro to display it on the Analyze page to see what it looks like without editing our actual data.
