Hello [@silentsairam](/profile/silentsairam) ,
My name is Rose.  I've been testing the image deletion on the website.  Thank you for making us aware of the issue.  
I'm following up to see if you're still not able to delete the images on your map?  If so, would you please explain in further detail your process in attempting to delete the image?  Maybe that would help me in determining where the problem lies.  Thank you.

I look forward to your reply
