Yeah, we use cloth diapers for our kids and it's important to find detergent without any dyes or whiteners because that stuff will build up over time, so we've spent a good amount of time trying to find detergents without them.  My wife was pretty impressed to see we could use this for a quick test of company's claims ;)

By the way Jeff, I saw you've added the option to download the data in CSV format now.  I tried it in excel and it imported perfectly, thanks!  I'm pretty busy with work for the next couple weeks, but I'll keep you posted with some of the things I can do with the data now.
