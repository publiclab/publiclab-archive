The next part of this can be viewed on page 6 of the mockups (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TCZoTfuhamRVrUak8aDgqJAwSgyhRtZg2Pgacl2_4zc/edit#slide=id.g5d175a1318_0_0), based on page 6 of the Style Guide (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-XHlVn3KQxSjS5WzHgc1l1qvFwqUC5f3-7GXugUP9u4/edit?ts=5cab5403#slide=id.g58d9556a0e_1_528). 

Based on some feedback, I'm hoping to get at the following issues:

 - The tags under "see more" are too dissimilar from the large topic cards and need to be more visually coherent. To solve this, we can update the smaller tags under "see more" like shown below, to make the font should be the same and just a little smaller, appear in an outlined box, displayed one per line.
 - A student had trouble because they thought they were adding the tag "soil x" instead of "soil" because the 'x' that denotes the delete function is visually so similar to the font of the tag. I would propose that the delete function should no longer be an ‘x’ but be moved into the “...” context menu of the topic cards, both big and small. 
 - The wording "8 more" to unfold the additional tags is a bit cryptic and doesn't describe what users are seeing when they make the expansion. Perhaps we could change the text to something like "This is also a part of:"
 - It is confusing that the '+' sign after the text "8 more" doesn't expand to show the 8 more tags but instead opens the tag editor. As it stands, the format suggests that this would be the function of the '+' sign. To remedy this, I'd suggest that we move the '+' sign to before the text and use it to expand the hidden tags _and_ to open the tag editor. 
 - This new system would need a new way to display the power tags and can be used an opportunity to onboard more users to the power tag system. A sub section of the "This page is also a part of:" expansion could call out the power tags. If possible, we could link the word 'powertags' to the wiki to increase a user's understanding of how things are organized on the site. 

Please take a look at the proposed changes here:
