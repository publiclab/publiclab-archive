As I understand it PM2.5 implies an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 microns, straight forward with no "mean" involved.  The "mean" enters with the epa approved monitoring equipment which use a "cyclone" with a 50% cut point of 2.5 microns. This is the point at which 50% of the particulate mass captured will be below 2.5 microns and 50% above. Similar statements would apply to PM10.
