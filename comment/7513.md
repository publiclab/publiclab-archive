Wow, thanks for the interesting design.  Just a comment, it looks like the photodiode array has a peak at 800nm and but continues to have some spectral sensitivity down to 1000nm, according to the specifications sheet <a href="http://www.ams.com/eng/content/download/250183/975717/file/TSL1406R_Datasheet_EN_v1.pdf">here</a>.  By contrast, the white LED source is basically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode">zeroed between 700 and 800nm</a>, while by contrast incandescent lamps have high radiant flux <a href="http://zeiss-campus.magnet.fsu.edu/print/lightsources/tungstenhalogen-print.html">far into the infrared </a>.  It looks like your components could be good for a spectrometer with a spectral range down to 1000nm--with the caveat that I don't know what are the spectral limitations of the your diffraction grating, and wasn't been able to find a source for this specification for the diffraction gratings I could find online, e.g. at Amazon
