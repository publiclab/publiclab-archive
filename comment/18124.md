[@ewilder](/profile/ewilder) and [@hannahJG](/profile/hannahJG) - I've moved this page over to https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-photopaper -- and I really love [the how-to guide](https://publiclab.org/wiki/hydrogen-sulfide-photopaper#How+to+Guide)! Do you think you could use this link to copy-paste the content of the how-to guide into our new Activities system, so it can get featured more prominently on the site?
