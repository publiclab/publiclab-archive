Well, probably not Starlink (>14.0GHz), but there are other satellites in this band. I generated a heatmap (using rtl_power) on 137.000MHz - 137.999Mhz for 15 minutes, ran the results through heatmap.py and got this:

[![20190108-162501-NOAA19-heatmap.png](/i/40951)](/i/40951?s=o)

That's NOAA19 at 137.100MHz, and ORBCOMM satellites at 137.290/137.740MHz and 137.250Mhz/137.310Mhz.  No interference there.

Notice the Doppler Shift of the satellite frequencies as they fly by...
