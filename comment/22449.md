I have not worked with water chemistry sensors, but your first impression might be a good one -- a device that can send encoded concentrations of N molecules will be expensive, proprietary, and require regular calibration. There are some ideas out there for making a DIY colorimeter to quantify a color reagent test, but developing an automated version of that sort of thing is more like a master's degree project than a high school assignment. 

If there is large variation in the nitrogen molecule concentration, maybe there is a proxy that could be measured. For example, if the N concentration changes dramatically, maybe temperature, conductivity, turbidity, and water color also change in a certain way. It's easier to make sensors for those parameters, and real time data on all of them might provide a signature for N concentration. Tracking those parameters would certainly alert you to changes in the system even if you weren't sure what caused them.
