Hi, just responding to the stalled exports issue; [@icarito](/profile/icarito) is right that we are still trying to add more error reporting so this is not as mysterious, but on checking those exports, it seems they are exporting at roughly 0.02 cm/px and that is resulting in a quite gigantic image -- 84743 x 84743 pixels -- so those surely failed to export due to running out of memory. I think in general it's going to be tough to run exports at greater than 10k x 10k pixels -- that's just a really giant TIFF file -- and maybe ~15k x 15k would be the extreme limit. 

The extremely low resolution at common (~50cm/px) scales here is still just a result of this being a map of a very tiny real-world area, so it means all our usual expectations about what resolutions will work are just shifted to a smaller scale. It should still work, but we need to figure out what the best resolutions are -- going back to my old response in https://publiclab.org/notes/pataxte/05-07-2020/mapknitter-exports-are-very-small-scale-unreadable#c26803 perhaps something like 0.2cm/px is ideal?
