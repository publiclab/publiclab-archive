Sounds like a great application for NIR imagery. I think you may even benefit by putting your camera back up in the air --> balloon mapping or a small drone plane/multirotor depending on the size of area you're surveying. the recent release of the PiNoir camera-board for the Raspberry-Pi SBC (which PublicLab was involved with) may be a really good solution as you won't have to deal with focus and it has really good resolution (5 MP) which should be plenty for what you're doing as the res should be higher than satellite images (i am not up to date with exact resolutions anymore).
