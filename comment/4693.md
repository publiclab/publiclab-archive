Hi, Natalie - The main mercury lines of a CFL are completely stable -- it's the smaller europium and terbium lines which vary a bit. The ones that the website asks you to use are the mercury lines and will always be in the same place...

Ah, can you just post the URL of the spectrum you used to calibrate? Thanks!
