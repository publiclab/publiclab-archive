[@mathew](/profile/mathew) I must admit to not reading what was being discussed, only that you said I don't like iframes and [@warren](/profile/warren) said its fine for pieces of media, so I assumed the user was not directly inputting what URL the iframe references. If the visualizations are made using mapknitter and the iframes don't reference any old URL the user puts in, that's fine. I think if the user is all like "woopeee I made visualization at where.ever.on.the.inter.net and I'm 'gun link it in this fancy doohickey", then we could have a problem. That visualization could be any number of things we would rather not see ;) especially if the spammers can easily add annotations with iframes to any old internet.
