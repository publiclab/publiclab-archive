Folks at NASA AREN (#aren) sent this over -- a smartphone method for water color, interesting!

> The prevalence of cell phones among teachers and students provides for the possibility of water quality monitoring with minimal financial investment (In contrast, the Hach turbidity meter used to calibrate HydroColor costs ~$1,000.00). The only investment required (assuming an iPhone is available) is a photographers gray card, which can be purchased for a few dollars.
