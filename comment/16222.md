Hey Glenn, 

Ah, I'm struggling to come up with options for analysis of Sargent's operations. The only thing I can think of is landscape metric type analysis based on satellite imagery over time, and I just don't think that information would be relevant for much of anything... 

I'll keep turning it over in my head. Let me know if you, or anyone else, have any thoughts.

Be well, and keep the pictures coming-
