Hi Willie
Is the actual sensor used in the video a dustduino? I was surprised by the high sampling frequency of a low cost DIY device...

The influence of air velocity with readings is a fascinating topic. Mobile air pollution monitors implemented on trucks currently used in some cities obviously must have some sophisticated ways to take care of this. Anyone know how they do it?
