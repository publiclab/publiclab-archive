I ordered a 3d-printed spectrometer attachment on Shapeways.com (it'll be about $14 or so when done) and will report back in a week or two when it arrives. I'll open source the design and we can adapt it (in Sketchup) for different phones and cameras, and people can print precise copies on Shapeways. 

This seems like an interesting new way to develop open hardware designs... and if we find an "optimal" design we can try to get the part manufactured in bulk for very cheap. 

One more thing -- the cost of 3d printing is pretty high as the spectrometer gets longer -- i think it needs to be longer because the phone cam can't focus on things that are too close to the lens -- but I was thinking we could adapt the design to just be a lens cover and an end cap, and the long tube could be sourced from something else easily found -- a standard PVC tube or something, which we could cut to varying lengths.

Attaching the sketchup file in a sec...
