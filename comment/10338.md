Please explain what is meant by: "During the period when I am sleeping peacefully in my tent (after ~25 mins), the RH and CO2 readings seem to fluctuate in a correlated way. "   I did a correlation for RH and CO2 from 2:30 to 3 and got a value of 0.05.  This doesn't indicate any correlation. I must be misunderstanding?
