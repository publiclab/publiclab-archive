Hi [@warren](/profile/warren)  [@molangmuir10](/profile/molangmuir10) 

1. Connect to the Network as the same with Rpi.
2. Click on Download Images and Videos from SD card. I used San Disk 16GB A1 Micro SD card.
3. Select the Images/Videos needed to download.
4. If you select all, it might take some time as Size of Images is a bit higher resolution.

Ensure the Wifi  Network name is 00-Pi-Camera while connecting and downloading the Images and Videos.

Attached video for reference. Hope this helps.
