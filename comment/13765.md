[@bortek](/profile/bortek) -I am assuming that the noise is partly due to the filter thickness and light requirement. I believe the Event38 filter is 0.5mm thick and the MidOpt is 1mm. They are both thicker than the factory IR filter. I spent a lot of time adjusting the focus with both filters and got them improved. Here is an image with the MidOpt filter from about 350ft with the final focus. The edges are not great but they stitch ok. This is with f/4, exp 1/1600, ISO 400

Are you looking for a filter for a single camera or dual camera NDVI? A 8.9X7.9 filter will fit nicely in the Canon S100.
The channels correspond to the filter I'm using and the channels on that camera to calculate NDVI. So with the Red filter the Red channel(VIS red) is used for the visible band in NDVI equation and the Blue channel(NIR blue) now records NIR for the equation. The downside with single camera NDVI is that all channels record some level of NIR.
