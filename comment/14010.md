Hey  pdhixenbaugh, I was running this test because I know that glass can absorb UV radiation and the quartz cuvettes are suppose to let UV light pass without any absorption so I was testing the theory out with a uv laser and LED, the repeatability tests are a good idea though.

As far as the inverse square law, I don't think there is a problem since the distance is so very small.

Plus these series of tests where done straight ahead and not at a 90deg angle which would be normal in fluorescence spectrometry.

Thanks for replying have a good one!
