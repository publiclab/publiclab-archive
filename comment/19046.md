The strategy which I am adopting will minimise the chances of the requirement of merge of 2 accounts. 
We will have a single account with all providers linked to it. Also, if required the person will be able to unlink his/her provider account and can link another account.
Can you explain in which cases do we require merge??? Want your views.
One situation could be a single person has multiple accounts on public labs and has a single Facebook account. He wishes to connect to both of his accounts via his single account on Facebook. 
So, when the person tries to link an already linked facebook provider to his account which lacks login through FB functionality, he will be notified with flash message - "Please link to another FB account. This Facebook account is already linked to someone" (somewhat).
