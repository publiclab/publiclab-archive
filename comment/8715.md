You can also measure volume in meshmixer - run the 'Stability' tool under the Analysis tab, and the volume and surface area will be shown in a pop-up.

One issue you might have is that it looks like there are some artifacts in your meshes, this could affect any attempts to make measurements from the mesh. You might consider running the 'Make Solid' command, it will have some slight resampling artifacts, but produce a clean mesh that will produce results that are more trust-worthy.

If you have ideas for other types of measurements that might be useful to do in this context, I would be interested to hear about them. If you are doing lots of the types of operations you describe above, I could also suggest some workflow improvements.
