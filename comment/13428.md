Hi Chris,

Thank you very much for kind response.

I converted various plant's images into NDVI index as per your suggestion for infragram standard version.I get better result for these images.But i didn't understand how to you have a calculate 0.09 value in below equation.
((B-R)/(B+R))+0.09

I have some further quires regarding your suggestion.So,I requested to addressing them,

1) Is there any other calibration method or software available for calibration of infragram plant camera ?
2) Can you provide me detail of above calculation ?

Please let me know if you need more information from my side.

Thanks & regards,
