Correct on the Cardboard  Lens, I suspected the same after finding it very hard and expensive to get a openflexure tube lens. OpenLab has a scope that uses a cardboard lens, or very close to one, using a 50mm focal length where cardboard is 45mm (both 25mm dia) http://openlabtools.eng.cam.ac.uk/Instruments/Microscope/Optics/  They do not have 3d printed tubes. I am making a design once I find the correct position for the tube lens. Wrestling with using my picam v2 with the lens on so I can have it mounted on my printer, allowing me to switch between a printer cam or controlled microscope by just screwing on a lens. So far, I have had better luck with the M12 low refraction lens kept on.
