[@donblair](/profile/donblair) Thanks for understanding. I was getting frustrated that my words had no meaning and I could not think how else to elucidate them.

I see what you are saying about embedding YouTube, but I do not believe it is proper to compare that to embedding HTML. For one, consider the ontological consequences. HTML can implement HTML recursively to an infinite degree and HTML can implement YouTube or PornHub equally. Contrast with YouTube media link, which cannot embed anything additional except for the video and player in question. This is not meant to be a practical example of a problem, but express how these two elements are radically different and thus come with completely separate considerations. Apples and oranges is what the humans would say.

I think iframes are extremely risky at a high level. At a low level, it accomplishes what you want. But shooting dictators would appear to do what you want, until you learn about blowback. Nothing is as simple as it first appears.

With respect to a wrapper, this is getting back to the idea of a portable research note format. Imagine if the wrapper was just a document format. A portable research note format, once designed and constrained properly, could certainly be a great approach to importing, linking, or exporting notes into/out of Public Lab. Of course, the into Public Lab piece is still fraught with peril.

Here's the reason I suggest federation: maybe public lab isn't actually the best place to _host_ , _find_, and _read_ research notes. Maybe it's a great place to create research notes for the average person, and publish them for the average person. But you guys, with your whats-its and do-hickeys, might want to come up with a new way to display the research notes. By separating content, tools, and publishers, we allow other experts to exceed our capabilities with e.g. publication while allowing the open standard format (hypothetical research note wrapper as a document format) to move the content freely between such publishers as Public Lab or Don-and-Jeff-Bonanza.
