Sorry, should've posted more details. 

* Yes, duct tape, folded over the dowel with a narrow margin of mylar
* Thin bamboo dowels (like garden bamboo, 1/4", unsplit and in one case splinted with a second piece).
* Leading edge spars run the entire edge, meeting in front.
* Spreader spar not reinforced. 

* Bridle point was eyeballed but i've been using 9' deltas a LOT recently so Im pretty familiar with them.
* that tail has so revolutionized my kite flying recently that I don't fly anything without a tail, ever, any more. But i can try it itd be interesting. I'd hazard a guess that a big tail can compensate for a lot of small design issues.

Here are photos. Amazingly, it's very very close to the Dazzle Delta, which i guess means I should do those pig's weight guessing games at county fairs more... good eye for measurements, i guess? Probably just lucky.

And a strong caveat -- it's flown but not under very tough conditions, not very high in the air, and not for very long... yet. It was too hot today to fly, actually, so we didn't get to test again. Also, it doesn't dis-assemble so it's not very portable. 

I wonder if just trash bags could work on this design???
