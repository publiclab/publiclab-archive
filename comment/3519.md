Hi Spectralod, Your [long tube CFL](https://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/3997) spectrum is calibrated correctly. I am not sure why you are not getting more distinct peaks with regions between them which are dark.  You should be able to get better resolution by making your entrance slit a little narrower. It might be that your camera is not focusing very well. But I found that an iPhone 4 was able to focus really well all by itself, although I was using 1000 lines/mm film instead of a DVD. It could also be that the image is over exposed.  I got a free app that allowed the iPhone exposure to be set for a small area of the image where you touch. That helped some. If you embed that spectrum in a post at the plots-spectrometry Google group, maybe someone will recognize the problem.
Good luck
