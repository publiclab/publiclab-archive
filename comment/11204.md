Andresc4, The A2300 allows custom white balance. For a red or yellow filter, flood the sensor with red light (fill the frame with red paper in direct sunlight) while pressing the button for custom white balance. Using that setting for photos exaggerates the values in the blue channel (NIR) and the NDVI values for some foliage come out close to real ones.
