Love this! That even if nobody is reading (learning) from your shared work, you are changing the knowledge in your own understanding, potentially to your benefit. 

Another phrase occurred to me with regard to the tendency to create new experts and jargon - that of "storing less in your brain" -- that is, being conscious of whether you're using knowledge (of context, perhaps) which isn't being recorded or exchanged, or if you're providing that extra information when you're communicating your knowledge, so that you or someone else can fully access and engage with what you're sharing. 

Maybe this is not quite clearly articulated, but I just love the idea of preserving your "beginner's mind" as you develop expertise. It allows for such empiricism when others read or use your work.
