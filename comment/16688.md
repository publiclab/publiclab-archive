Nicely done [@matthew](/profile/matthew). I'm sure you all had a lot of fun. A few comments: 
Sometimes the text says  the monitoring is for pm10 whereas the notes say pm2.5
Mines are not always doing the same tasks or even operating. Was the Great Northern mine operating that Friday? Was there any loading of rail cars?
If one monitors near a road or intersection it would be important to note any traffic
Wind speed is often not recorded after the first site. Does this imply no change from then?
Checking the Wisconsin DNR site for hourly pm2.5 readings in EauClaire and LaCrosse would give a comparison and done right could be informative of local vs regional concentrations. I checked and it appears your readings and the hourly readings are basically(in my estimation) consistent. 
It would be nice to have some overall comments or observations from those who participated. What did you learn? accomplish? insights for future attempts? 
What did your monitored readings tell you?
