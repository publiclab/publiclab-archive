Hello! We've put a lot of instructions up at http://publiclab.org/micro, but given that there are a number of variants of the kit, I agree that we could better highlight the build instructions for different parts. There is some guidance for Pi camera assembly in https://publiclab.org/notes/bronwen/05-07-2018/microscope-webcam-conversion, but we should break that out and expand it into it's own post. 

The stage assembly is also at https://publiclab.org/micro with all the other documentation, and people have been posting their build photos and feedback there. Please do the same, and we'll get the separated-out Pi Camera assembly instructions up in the next day or two. Thank you!

We've taken photos of the Pi-specific assembly steps, and are almost ready with the fuller broken-out guide:
