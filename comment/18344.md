I am using that website.  I have tried both before and after clicking the "offline" option.  During acquisition there are buttons labeled "Save" and "Download."  "Download" just produces a png image of the spectrum on the screen.  I can save that picture, but that's not what I want.    The other button, "Save", prompts for a title and then takes me to a webpage with the aforementioned graph.  I see no option labeled export or download on that page.  I don't even know where the data is being saved.  Probably in some *&^%$#@! cloud.
