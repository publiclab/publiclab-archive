Mario,  
After the internal filter has been removed, a new filter can be used either inside the camera or in front of the lens. It's hard to keep the filter clean and free of scratches when it is in front of the lens, but it makes it easy to test filters. The red filter has some advantages over the blue filter: https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/11-01-2013/why-a-red-filter-should-work-well-for-ndvi

Photoscan can stitch photos together and output a single composite image. That image could be converted to NDVI using the Photo Monitoring plugin for Fiji: https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/01-13-2016/packaged-photo-monitoring-plugins-available-on-the-github-repositoy

Photos can be dragged into research notes or comments. The photo will be uploaded and code will be inserted into your text where the cursor was. Click "Preview" to see your photo.
