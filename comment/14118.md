Whew!  All's well that ends well!

Every once in a while a freak gust or wind shift will send a kite headed downwards (or high wind conditions outside the kite's flight range)   there's a quick but counter-intuitive fix-- let line out until the kite rights itself, then give it a tug to lock in a clime. 

Letting line out is the secret to correcting dives. remember "when in doubt, let line out!"
