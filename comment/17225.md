Thank you so much [@LaPa](/profile/LaPa) for your insights and sharing the experience.
Would be possible for you share with me how did you implemented, using the raspberry pi, this part that you mentioned in your post:

"I use "ImageJ (FiJi)" + "photo monitoring plugin" to elaborate raw IR photos into NDVI by using InfraBlue.lut that you can see here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUKliCFogxA."

If [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie), who also seems very experienced on the field, has any clue, that would be awesome.

I'll be happy to share with you as well if I manage to move things forward and get reliable NDVI data.
Thank you guys.
