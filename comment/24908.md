***This note is a GSOC Phase 1 summary and updates Phase 2 goals.***
Research notes are posted at https://publiclab.org/profile/MaggPi.  Comments on software programs (posted at https://github.com/MargaretAN9) are listed below:

**Work  can be divided into three parts: **

•	**Satellite image processing** – Processed NDVI Landsat and Planet satellite images with a variety of software techniques (python, Image Sequencer, QDIS, Adobe ).  This was done to establish a baseline for improved Image sequencer modules.  Example processed images available at: https://mapknitter.org/profile/MaggPi

•	**Image Sequencer documentation** – Developed draft Image Sequence User Manual.   The manual will be updated for each phase of the project and will provide a summary of the GSOC effort.  https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/06-10-2019/draft-of-public-lab-image-sequencer-user-manual-comments-welcome

•	**OpenCV/Image Sequencer Installation** - Installed OpenCV.js and Image Sequencer with mixed results:   
o	Spent several days trying to resolve a ‘throw error’ when loading Image Sequence on a Windows machine.  Problem was resolved by using an older version of node (8.9.1 vs 10.16.0).  Future documentation needs to reference node version requirements.  
o	Completed test case demo circle of openCV.js/IS circle detection algorithm.  Code is posted at https://github.com/MargaretAN9/GSOC-2019/tree/master/opencvjsCircleDetect    and example output is available at  https://github.com/MargaretAN9/GSOC-2019/blob/master/circle%20picture.png .  This  example and  [@aashnaaashna](/profile/aashnaaashna) ‘s breakthrough blob processing demo illustrate Image Sequencer’s potential and the IS evolution from  Image Processing to Image Analysis tool.

o	Currently working installation  errors such as  grunt build failure /heap running out of memory  after loading OpenCV and new IS modules.

o	Another issue is understanding  different options to load and use openCV with Image Sequencer .  It may take several designs/evaluations before limitations and advantages of each approach are understood.   

**Phase 2 will continue debugging OpenCV/IS.**  If the system is stable future  modules will concentrate on analyzing geoTIFF images.   Thanks to Warren for referencing  Mappknitter-Exporter-js (see thread discussion above) .  Is it possible to use the cloud feature to import/store  large geoTIFF images?   Looking for a way to get around the 10MB MapKnitter limitation and import larger (~200MB) geoTIFF files.
