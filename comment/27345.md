EDIT: I've posted this in question form [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/pdhixenbaugh/09-12-2020/pendulum-or-picavet-for-kites-why).

Hi [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie)! Apologies if this has been answered elsewhere, but as I've been searching I haven't found an explicit answer.

What about the pendulum and the picavet makes the picavet better for Kite photography?

According to what I can find, the pendulum works better for vertical lines, like with a balloon on a calm day. Does the Picavet handle the erratic motion of the kite line better, and provide better stability than a pendulum would?

I would like to try the jerkpan on the aerobee with a kite, and it looks like if I could only buy one, I would get the pendulum. What do you think?
