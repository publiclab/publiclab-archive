Finishd the OPK Firmata CLI for one-pin readings: https://github.com/jywarren/opk-firmata-cli/

[@rjstatic](/profile/rjstatic) and [@donblair](/profile/donblair) - pretty useful; basically anything you can plug into an Arduino you can now plug into OPK, I think? Might be good to add:

* auto-detection of attached sensors (i.e. scan digital and analog ports and see if anything's attached? This might not work if you don't have pull-down resistors, right?)
* listening on multiple pins at once (wouldn't be too hard, but wanted to keep this first version simple)
* a config file to set which ports to listen on and what to name them in the output, if JSON is specified
