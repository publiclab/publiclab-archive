The per unit cost is about about $35 if you are buying everything (microcontroller, PCBs, components...) and you are using the real time clock. The GPS unit itself is about $35, so if you need to know where you are at, its bit more expensive. Also I should say the PCB fabricator (OSH Park) has a three board minimum for each type of board ordered, and each set of three cost about $20.
