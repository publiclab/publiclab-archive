How should we display data?

Sara, I will email you on this

here's a spreadsheet
http://db.tt/eF9QWxxK

photos of the strips as a table?

if height matters more than opening, there are four groupings ranked by opening method. 

sorry if this is a bit confusing, but this is how the sample design ended up.

3a, 4a
1a, 2a
1b,2b,3b,4b   (a control for site variation)

7a, 8a
5a, 6a
5b,6b,7b,8b

3c,4c
1c,2c
1d,2d,3d,4d

7c,8c
5c,6c
5d,6d,7d,8d

2) if method of opening matters more than height,

3a,4a
7a,8a
3c,4c
7c,8c

1a,2a
5a,6a
1c,2c
5c,6c

1b,2b,3b,4b
5b,6b,7b,8b
1d,2d,3d,4d
5d,6d,7d,8d
