[@cfastie](/profile/cfastie): well, I recall that we made whole leaf spectra in the lab (me = biologist, Ph D of UAntwerp). Guess with a decent light source you can do that with your equipment too ?  So no, it is not necessary... I just wondered if it could enhance the signal (you have a noisy background). Just a question - if you shook that extract, could you still measure a spectrum ? or was it just degraded chlorophyll ?  Also - please don't take this as criticism!! You're doing great work (I love it, and hope to join the fun as soon as I have some time). 

[@vanjo63](/profile/vanjo63): in the student lab I taught, we separated the two (even chl a and b and different carotenoids) on a column of potato starch. Elution with petroleum ether and toluene, but maybe something else (cheaper or less toxic) works also.
