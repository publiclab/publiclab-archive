Interesting! At first I was wondering if the change in time-step occurred after the Riffle reached 0 deg-C, but then when I looked at your data table, it looks like it never goes below 19.75 C (when there was the 55 second delay), but in your plot it does show it recording temps to -5 C. Do you know what is going on there? Anyway, the top plot shows more data spacing just after passing below 0 C -- maybe at -1 C. I wonder if that is somehow related.
