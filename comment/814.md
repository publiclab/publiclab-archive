The pigment doesn't really wear off and I don't have to re-coat the balloon between flights. 

  Next time I make one I'll have to weigh the balloon before and after coating, but my impression is that each balloon takes much less than an ounce of pigment.  Volumetrically it only takes about a tablespoon. That said, its hard to coat the balloon unless its filled with a good quantity of pigment to work around; just throwing a tablespoon in doesn't work very well.

When Molly brought me the first pigment sample, it was less than a 4 volumetric ounces,, and that served to make 3 twelve foot balloons and 5 seven foot balloons, with some left over and about half of it recklessly spilled.

I'd bet that a pound could be divided into 20 or more packets each good for a few balloons.
