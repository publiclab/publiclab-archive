The probe we're using is an [accumet AP85](http://www.fishersci.com/ecomm/servlet/fsproductdetail_10652_659838__-1_0) from Fisher Scientific. We're assuming this is working perfectly--admittedly it too should be calibrated. I've got access to calibration standards--the next step will be checking against these.
