You're right that the filter is slightly curved.  I was worried to glue it in flat in place, and didn't think it would be too much of an issue if there was a slight curve.
 
I wasn't able to fix the focus of the IR mode.  I suspect its an optical issue, IR likely focuses differently than visible light.  We saw the same issue of fuzzy IR images with point and shoots as well, and this may be a major case for using camera pairs. The sanm cam has a longer depth of field and I'd be interested to see if it works differently.
