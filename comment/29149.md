In my experience, well-thought out data visualization is a huge benefit to making content digestible, approachable, and meaningful.   [EDF ](https://business.edf.org/insights/how-data-visualization-can-accelerate-environmental-progress/) pulls in some great supporting arguments for how data visualizing can support EJ action.  
1.  Storymaps are one great visual tool to embed monitoring data into, see this example here on [pollution in Detroit](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/66cb46d9eb394990adfa5ceef4a48bbd).  

2.  Data visualization and justice are the focus of [this group's work](https://envirodatagov.org/environmental-data-justice/), which could be a great ongoing collaborative space for those interested.

3.  Sunrise Movement has focused on [data visualization through their organizing and policy advocacy](https://medium.com/nightingale/what-is-the-role-of-data-viz-in-the-movement-to-stop-the-climate-crisis-a82fe3e24eab).  Their Digital Director gave this answer to the question, "What is your design process around data visualization?"

"When I do data visualization at Sunrise, most of the work occurs before I even open my script. I spend time meeting with program leads, directors, and staff to get to the heart of what information they need from the data visualization. I start by working with key staff on what their programmatic goals are, then how they know when they have achieved them, then what data are available to us to measure success along the way. By the time I sit down to write my code I’ve done all the hard work. On the tech side of things, I’m lucky to have a powerful CRM that syncs to our data warehouse (Civis), and from there I can make dynamic dashboards in [Periscope](https://www.periscopedashboard.com/). My one-off visualizations and any kind of spatial mapping is done in Python with a slew of packages, including Seaborn, Plotly, and GeoPandas."

4.  More long form interviews on organizing and data visualization can be found [here](https://medium.com/nightingale/topics-in-data-viz/home).
