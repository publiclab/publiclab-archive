We're working on an open absorption and fluorescence tool for measuring plant photosynthesis and I would love to also know about what sensors you're using, and the detection limits and all that stuff.  We have some additional sensors in there also (temp, rel hum, CO2, etc.) but we're always interested to include more and it sounds like you've identified a few good ones.  Feel free to browse our project for sensors or circuits that may be useful to you (www.photosynq.org, and project docs are at https://github.com/Photosynq.

Also, we are setting up a platform so that arduino-based devices can easily connect and store data on the web via a cell phone app.  It may be a good fit for this too eventually, though we've got some work to do before it's really ready to roll.

Awesome work!
