I managed to cobble together an Arduino program to try this out:

> Button turns on one of two fans, randomly. On second press, it reveals which had been on by turning on one of two corresponding LEDs.

And a circuit (will post in a moment) that fits in a jar lid -- although I need to plug in both fans, and need a couple transistors since I guess the Arduino can't drive these fans directly from its pins (I'm still a newbie after all these years using Arduinos...).

It'll need some ducting design, and i guess a tube to go down into the roots from the lid. But it's a start!
