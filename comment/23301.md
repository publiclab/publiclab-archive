You are correct that both red and NIR pass through the red filter (Rosco Fire # 19) and both are captured in the red channel of the photograph. It is not possible to distinguish the colors in a single channel after the photo has been taken.

For some cameras the spectral response of each channel is known, and for very few cameras this spectral response includes the NIR region. In even fewer cases, the spectral response of the camera after it has been converted with a red filter is known.

An example of this type of information and how it can be used to estimate the degree of NIR contamination in the red channel [is here.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/plots-infrared/academic$20article|sort:date/plots-infrared/aJhM30D6bUM/zuZqlFYiHQAJ) For the PowerShot A2200 described there, the amount of NIR contaminating the red channel should be equal to about twice the brightness of the blue channel.
