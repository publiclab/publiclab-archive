Hi [@vinushi1995](/profile/vinushi1995)..did you get your project working? I am having a similar problem with the PMS7003. I am using similar code to yours. It does appear to work with the PMS5003 which is similar but a bit larger footprint. But when I use the 7003 with the same code I also am getting values that are 10x-20x larger than expected. Not sure what is causing this as it is claimed that the two sensors are electrically identical and use the same data protocol. Appreciate any thoughts/suggestions from forum members.
