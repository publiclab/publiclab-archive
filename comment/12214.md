Reply to ctoft musings,

Your (ctoft) experiments with the PLab 3.0 spectrometer and PLab oil-test kit prototypes demonstrated the requirement to build mechanically stable devices. While it can be educational to observe a working webcam+DVD spectrometer and recover colorful plots, performing real measurements requires repeatability which means stability.

I agree wholeheartedly!

I'd like to comment on your musings one by one: This comment webpage doesn't allow me to add co

loured text, which makes my reply clearer. I have therefore done a WORD file and added it below.

1 - The optical path from slit to DVD to camera must be a) rigid and b) allow for precise alignment.

I have built my own spectrometer for studying the chemical composition of garden soil by building it fromsquare black plastic rainwater downpipe, which is available in the UK (referred to hereafter just as downpipe)

2 - Black paper is good for low reflections and can provide a low cost light-tight volume space, but is useless in terms of mechanical rigidity.

Inside the downpipe I slide a tube made from folded cardboard, covered with black velvet. I get no reflections from the black velvet. The folded cardboard tube just slides into the downpipe, it is not glued in place, it doesn't need to be glued in place.

3 - Given the slit-camera distance, with a narrow photo-image slit, the slit material must be held fixed relative to the DVD/Camera to reduce spectral noise (for better resolution).

I have made, from pieces of downpipe, frames for all of the components needed to make the spectrometer. I use a black epoxy resin glue (available in the UK as JB Weld). It is sold for glueing metal. It is black and stronger than normal epoxy glue.
I use an angle grinder to cut up the downpipe.

4 - Any "add-on", such as the oil-test-kit module, must be mechanically tied to the spectrometer "frame" (which provides the spectrometer optical path stability) -- a paper interface is not enough.

See comments for number 3

5 - The UV laser illumination of an oil sample (to be viewed by the spectrometer) must also be rigid so as to eliminate amplitude variations in the spectral signal. (Remember, if you are comparing signatures of samples where the major difference is amplitude of a broad peak, amplitude variations can easily create measurement noise that is a large fraction of the signal you want to measure.

See comments for number 3.

6 - Mounting of oil-test-kit components must be rigid, relative to each other and relative to the spectrometer because any variation or vibration can cause poor measurement repeatability and sample-to-sample repeatability.

See comments for number 3.

7 - Reflections. Light from the UV laser can easily reflect off the black paper and cause intensity variations. Black paper is good, but reflections from it, and from distortions in the cuvettes, can cause significant variations.

My cuvettes also fit into frames made from downpipe. The cuvettes slide into velvet lined holes for rigidity, and to prevent scratching of the surface of the cuvettes. The 2 UV lasers also fit into frames made from downpipe; this frame also holdes multiple cuvettes for easier comparison of samples.

8 - At such "close range", the alignment (and alignment stability) of the spectrometer optical path through the slit becomes critical.

A measure of stability of such a system could be verified by repeat set-up, calibration and measurement of multiple samples and comparing the resulting data to calculate the measurement noise error.

I wholeheartedly agree.

All of the frames etc. fit into the downpipe ends rigidly. They could be glued in place, but I have not found that necessary.

I also have frames for:

Various cameras

Various light sources

Various diffraction gratings

Adjustable slit

Microscope slides

Petri dishes

I had a frame for an angular adjustment of the diffraction grating, but once I determined the correct angle I no longer need to use it.
