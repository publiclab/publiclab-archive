 No lighting effects-- the look of the sample shifts a lot depending on the angle/distance/brightness of the light-- the photo of the sediment at the bottom is set up so that the light is cancelling out most of the colors and we're looking at outlines (kind of like an x-ray effect), while the image in the header is coming a bit more from the side. The two photos in the the note (the zoomed in and out pics) are somewhere between those two.

For these pictures I lit from below using the flashlight on my phone, which I think was a little too bright. I've been using LED button lights which are a little easier to move around, and would like to try something with a dimmer function. 

The seaweed I grabbed is reddish/orange to start with, so it's not THAT big a color shift, but I was also a little surprised by how bright everything looks.
