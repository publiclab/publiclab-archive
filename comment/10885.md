Thanks Chris!

My default is to try and know what I am doing before involving other people, but I am actually pushing myself to make my kite-ing more social before then so that me and whoever else I can rope in can all fail together! 

I will have to read up more on rolling shutters. 

What kind of wind speeds does the steady little breeze have that you think is optimal? The day I was flying forecasted 5-20 km/h winds, and I am just in the process of learning what those numbers mean in real life and in relation to my kites, having paid no attention to them previously.  

My favourite kite folds up which is a big bonus for me, but is only 5' wide. Do you think it will fly with a camera in the optimal breeze you recommend?
