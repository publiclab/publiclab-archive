The only filter I tried that worked was Wratten 25A. Two blue filters worked poorly. [@mathew](/profile/mathew) has tried Rosco [#19](/n/19) which seems to work well. I don't remember any other research notes about comparisons among other filters. I eventually installed a Wratten 25A filter internally, then replaced it with a glass IR block filter to see if I could have a normal RGB camera again. That didn't work (the photos were way blurry) and I have not gotten back to troubleshooting.
