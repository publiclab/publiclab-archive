Thanks [@liz](/profile/liz) and [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie) for your advice and patience! Next steps are indeed clear; after some experimentation with [@nedhorning](/profile/nedhorning)'s photo monitoring plugin, I was able to replicate the NDVI image Chris created by selecting single image index processing and stretching the IR band by a factor of 3. I was also able to create the NDVI image below of the original photo of Newfoundland, though I doubt it will be one of those we can make much use of given the snow and lack of an orange hue in the original photo. Nevertheless, we are much better off than when we got started, and my students and I greatly appreciate your assistance Chris!
