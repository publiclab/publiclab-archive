Especially in mixtures, not all soluble solids are conductive.  So yes, you can dissolve (or sometimes suspend) something inert in water.  We would usually do at least a couple of tests to make sure we got most things.  The other was usually total solids.  And TDS and conductivity don't always directly relate.  Was reading premierwatermn.com/water-quality/water-contaminants/total-dissolved-solids/. It said, "TDS is calculated by converting the EC by a factor of 0.5 to 1.0 times the EC, depending on the levels."
As for how the TDS work.... The above quote makes you think it's done with EC, but don't know.
  
Typically, all the conductivity testing we did was close to room temp, although that was measured by the instrument.

The major difference in EC and TDS probably explains many of the differences (the 0.5 to 1.0 factor).
