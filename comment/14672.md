HI kensanfran,
I have used the TI AFE LMP91000 for 4-electrode gas sensor design with an external gain for the transimpedance amplifier. 
For the 4th electrode interface, i have configured LMP2231 as a transimpedance amplifier. 
The challenge am facing here is contain the noise levels and bring down to an identical level.
 Can you please educate me with some info on the noise performance characteristics of AFE LMP91000?
Regards,
Sathvik.
