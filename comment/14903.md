Hi, dear [@cfastie](/profile/cfastie), the webcam that I have been used is described in the follow link: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1722.  The filter used allow  take an infrared photo in the "red" channel of the camera, and a visible image in the "blue" channel.

Do you know a better software to use? I'm suspecting of the software used (ArcMaps).

Besides the NDVI image, I need of numeric values, as mean, minimum and maximum.

Thank you very much!
