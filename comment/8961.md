Ned,
From Maryâ€™s scans, you knew the reflectance of your colored targets for every visible and near infrared wavelength. But it looks like you used only the data for 650 nm (red) to do the calibration. Would you get a different answer if you used other wavelengths? Could you use several at once?

Your targets included a red card, but the others were white, gray, or black. Would it be better to also have a blue and green target? Or is the spectral curve of each target more important that the perceived color?
