Just caught this whole looking up some other stuff.  The technique most commonly used is atomic emission spectroscopy AES.  The flame is so strong, that they Usually give all kinds of interferences.  So, usually, the UV part of the spectrum is used.  For example, a common line with lead (Pb) is 283nm, with 217 nm as a back up.  These intermission lines, so no lamp is needed.  But since the strength of the flame is so strong, filters, before the spectrometer, are common.  Hope this helps.
