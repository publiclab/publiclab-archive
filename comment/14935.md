The new [SpectralWorkbench.js library](https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench.js) can (in Node.js javascript) convert a spectrum image file to a spectrum JSON or CSV file, so perhaps that's a way you could be doing this either onboard a drone or in automated post-processing. I think the way you'd want to do it is to carefully align a spectrometer with a video camera, and ensure (using a high-contrast pattern on the ground) you know which pixels the spectrum actually corresponds to. Then you could record periodic (or continuous, w/ video) spectra along with a video of what you're flying over. 

You'd probably want a more robust version, and smaller/more waterproof than the [Desktop Spectrometry Kit](https://publiclab.org/wiki/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0)), but this sounds plausible, though a good bit of work, with a compact Raspberry Pi-based spectrometer, like the one [@cristoforetti](/profile/cristoforetti) has been working on as part of [#webvalley](/tag/webvalley). 

Either the sequence of spectrum images or a frame-by-frame dump of a video of spectra could be processed using SpectralWorkbench.js. But keep in mind the spectrometer is not [#intensity-calibrated](/tag/intensity-calibrated) (though there are published methods for getting close, by [@stoft](/profile/stoft)), so without that you'd need to compare to reference data you collect on the same instrument in similar lighting conditions. 

This is a big project, but if you tackle it we'd love to hear how you do!
