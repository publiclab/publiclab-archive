What I've read is that the RPi camera used to use the OV5647 camera chip but has "upgraded" (changed chips) to a Sony IMX 219 PQ CMOS image sensor for which I've not found comprehensive specs -- like sensitivity and dynamic range. They only claim 3280x2464 native and 44.5dB "PGA" max -- which 'might be' related to dynamic range, but does not state it is -- and no sensitivity or sensitivity curves. The PLab link you gave to the OV5647 did not have that data either. That chip is 2592x1944 but the spec sheet does not quote sensitivity or dynamic range.
