Hi, Nick - really interesting post, thanks. Is the RKI-FP 30 meter a certified instrument for any regulations, or anything (noting that I think you've mentioned indoor home air is not really a regulated space). 

I'm also interested in how posts like these could ask for input on how to refine experimental methods, or propose followup methods to add robustness to its findings. This seems complex since exposure is involved, but I'm just interested in your thoughts. Thanks again!
