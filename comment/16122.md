[@dannysmith](/profile/dannysmith) -I have been using the Labsphere Permaflect coated targets http://labsphere.com/labsphere-products-solutions/materials-coatings-2/coatings-materials/permaflect-1/
their 2"X2" targets are in the $300 range and work great.
I suggest contacting Charlie Langlois with Labsphere- clanglois@labsphere.com
