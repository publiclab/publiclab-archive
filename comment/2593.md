The three channels in an NIR photo will record different proportions of NIR wavelengths (e.g., 700-1000 nm) because the Bayer filters are passing different proportions of these wavelengths. The particular wavelengths passed are haphazard and not by design because these wavelengths are normally blocked by the IR filter that we removed.  Below is an example for one camera model. Other cameras could be very different.

In addition, the film used as a visible light blocking filter leaks some wavelengths in the visible range which will be added to the signal picked up in one or more of the RGB channels of an NIR image.

So the three channels in an NIR photo will differ from one another for two hard to control reasons. It seems that the green channel in our DIY NIR images is often darker (histogram shifted to the left) than the red and blue channels. Shifting the green histogram to the right removes the pink tint in the images (try this in Photoshop). The histograms for both the red and blue channels are usually similar, so either one could be used successfully to make an NRG or NDVI image.   If the goal is to use one of these channels to make NRG or NDVI images, it may not matter which is used.  Because the NIR image may be dark (our NIR cameras require more light to make an exposure than unmodified cameras) whichever channel is brighter might be the best one to choose.
