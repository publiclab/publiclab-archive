Great! [@sashae](/profile/sashae) and I look forward to introducing ourselves on the call on Tuesday, May 26. We are interested in learning more about the Public Lab community, past experiments in satellite reception, and which aspects out our work might resonate with current projects. >>> A photo of [@sashae](/profile/sashae) and me (pre-social distancing!)

A great image [@sashae](/profile/sashae) captured this week when the lockdown in London was partially lifted. The last month we've been catching satellites from our flats, which is fun but our views of the sky are limited and there is a lot more interference.
