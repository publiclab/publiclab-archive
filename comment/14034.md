Today I got the solar phone charger and 32GB sd card, so I built a crude outdoor housing and asked for permission to throw this thing on the roof for a month.

I took a clear plastic container and mounted the solar array on the top, with the camera underslung by its mount, using the velcro tape provided with the camera.

I used thick baking-rack foil material to make a waterproof stand, which presses the array against the top of the plastic housing.

My thinking is that having it angled ever so slightly downward will keep rain out, and having the camera back a bit will protect against driving rain. The camera isn't waterproof, but its housing is pretty tight and I think this should be enough.

In future deployments, a simple front piece of optical acrylic or just picture glass could make it work better, but that would introduce its own issues with fog and moisture clinging to the glass. 

It looks as if the trickle charge is happening with no modifications. I did chose the "flip image" setting in the config file, since the camera is mounted upside down.

Cross fingers. Do not open until May 4. I'm coming back from a trip that day, and it's star wars day, so let's say may 4th...
