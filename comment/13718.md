I have wondered about how important it is to really extract the plant pigments for this type of absorbance observation. If you had an intact transparent leaf and put it between the light source and the spectrometer entrance slit, you might get a result very similar to vanjo63's result. The colors not absorbed by the leaf will pass through it. 

I have tried extracting plant pigments with grain alcohol (ethanol), and made a nice colored liquid which absorbed just as theory would predict (see https://publiclab.org/notes/cfastie/10-10-2013/lycopene). But I left the vials sitting around and after a few days all the color sank to the bottom of the vials suggesting that I did not have an extract but just a suspension of tiny pieces of plant tissue. I don't know if a true extract would provide better absorbance information.
