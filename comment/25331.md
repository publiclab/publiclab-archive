**This note is a GSOC 2019 Summary Report **

**Wrap up post with major major activities that were accomplished:**

**Image Sequencer Microscope Calibration:**

Demonstrated  several ways that Image Sequencer can be used to calibrate images recorded from digital microscopes. Designed a new Image Sequencer module with prestored calibration settings.

- [https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/08-19-2019/microscope-calibration-with-image-sequencer](https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/08-19-2019/microscope-calibration-with-image-sequencer)

**Satellite Processing:**

Demonstrated application which uses satellite imagery and OSM data with to highlight environmental characteristics.  Documentation available at:  [https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/08-17-2019/shades-of-green-openstreetmap-overlays-on-satellite-images](https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/08-17-2019/shades-of-green-openstreetmap-overlays-on-satellite-images).   This [Mapknitter link](https://mapknitter.org/maps/shades-of-green-overlay-of-nottingham-parks)  demonstrates how [overpass-turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) can be used to identify park areas  in satellite images, which then can then be processed to update OSM markings.  Code available at:
- [https://github.com/MargaretAN9/GSOC-2019/edit/master/sattelliteImageProcess/greenOperpassExV1.ipynb](https://github.com/MargaretAN9/GSOC-2019/edit/master/sattelliteImageProcess/greenOperpassExV1.ipynb)
- 

**Image Sequencer Manual:**

New Image Sequencer manual developed that includes the following:
- Adding new modules such as Noise reduction, Minify Image, blob Analysis, colorimetry
- Demonstration of Insert step functionality
- Increasing the applications section to include blob detection and colorimetry
- Adding an intro section which list modules according to their general functions;  such as color modification, size or shape changes, text/QR,etc.  (This approach may help develop submenus vs the current 40 long  dropdown list).

- [https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/pull/1171](https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/pull/1171)

**Initial announcement:**

- [https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/06-10-2019/draft-of-public-lab-image-sequencer-user-manual-comments-welcome](https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/06-10-2019/draft-of-public-lab-image-sequencer-user-manual-comments-welcome)

**Manual Version 0.3:**  
- [https://github.com/MargaretAN9/GSOC-2019/blob/master/ImageSequencerUserManual.md#saturation-module](https://github.com/MargaretAN9/GSOC-2019/blob/master/ImageSequencerUserManual.md#saturation-module)

Collaboration efforts include Q/A’s to anaconda, opencv, planet.com  and IS github sites.

**IS/OpenCV**

Established the ability to load OpenCV and then process images from data uri to string format and then to RGBA.  Have not been able to successfully transfer image from RGBA back into IS datauri display format.  At this point, aashna27  great work has superseded my efforts and it’s probably best to align with her designs.  My initial code trying to develop IS/openCV in a single file is available at: [https://github.com/MargaretAN9/GSOC-2019/tree/master/is%20w%20opencv](https://github.com/MargaretAN9/GSOC-2019/tree/master/is%20w%20opencv)

Once opencv is pushed,  several new options exist for IS modules. One possible option is a calibration module for microscope pictures which measure a known reference and provide data for the grid module.

**Additional work includes a post demonstrating VS Code as an operating environment for OpenCV.js:**

- [https://publiclab.org/notes/MaggPi/07-04-2019/introduction-to-image-processing-with-opencv-js](https://github.com/MargaretAN9/GSOC-2019/tree/master/is%20w%20opencv)




General Comments:
The focus of the GSOC effort changed over the course of the project.   The initial proposal concept of satellite processing with Image Sequencer was shifted to a analysis via a python/jupyter notebook environment that provided more comprehensive geospatial libraries.   Image Sequencer work was shifted to the microscope  calibration module to demonstrate and provide a well known use case.
