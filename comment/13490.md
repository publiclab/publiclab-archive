Hi, Chris - because we used lots of peaks to determine "fitness", we'd need all of the following nanometer positions plus their intensity (0-255):


          [404.66,   4],
          [435.83,  86],
          [487.70,  64],
          [543.50, 117],
          [546.07,  93],
          [577.00,   6],
          [579.10,  15],
          [587.60,  58],
          [593.00,  50],
          [598.00,  23],
          [611.60, 155],
          [630.00,  41],
          [650.00,  16],
          [661.00,   7]

Then, we'd need the source image for that reference to calculate the trough positions. It's probably easiest to upload a reference and calibrate it, and I can extract the values that way.
