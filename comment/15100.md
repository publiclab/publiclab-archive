I used a Fusion 360 model with the full assembly in the "wireframe with visible edges only" visual style and took screenshots, then I brought the pictures into Photoshop and added darker outlines, dotted lines, and highlighted the new components for each step in red.

Thanks, I'm looking forward to getting your feedback and suggestions on the kit!
