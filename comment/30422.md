 Environmental science is an interdisciplinary field thatâ€™s has a combined link of subjects that are intertwined with this field, to which they study the environment & etc. 

There are so many reasons, problems, solutions, & etc for why & how our environment is so very important. For future references our environment we will need a whole lot of things done soon, which is for why we need a lot of people to study this field. But nor do you need a science background to bring forth information.  

The way the speaker was talking about how environmental science is so very important, how she the speaker spoke so passionate about it to describe her I would say she is very emotional, eager, appreciative, & fond. She showed so much emotion towards our environment; eager to get other young people in this field to speak up about our environment.
