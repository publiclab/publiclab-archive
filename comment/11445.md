I got an idea about calibration...


I recently recorded spectrums of daylight, and actually got to see some Frauenhofer lines. Would those lines perhaps allow for more precise calibration?


Another thing, that's even more important. It has come to my attention that some camera sensors actually suppress some of the green light input. This can easily be seen by just searching for "sun spectrum" in here and compare with this: http://qdl.scs-inc.us/2ndParty/Images/Charles/Sun/SolarSpectrum2_wbg.png

Take a look at my attempts to get the solar spectrum right. Never does. My "white led spectrums" also suffer from this artifact. Could a script not be made, that could estimate how much the green light intensity of a given camera should be amplified in order to get a "solar spectrum" that to a higher degree resembles the actual solar spectrum? Please do that....please ^^

Cheers =)
