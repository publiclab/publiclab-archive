I conjecture that you just have an alignment problem.  My suggestion would be to fix the laser and scope alignment and then move the spectrometer around to get maximum reading.

Another method just occurred to me.  Remove the scope and firmly attach the board.  Hot melt glue would be a good choice.  Point the laser from the end of the board into the spectrometer and adjust the angle until you get the maximum reading.  Trace the angle of the laser onto the board.  I suspect that the angle is not straight down the axis of the spectrometer.  At this point you have a better probability of aligning the scope properly.
