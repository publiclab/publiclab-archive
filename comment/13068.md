Hi Chris thank you for the suggestions!
Do you think would it be a good idea take a set of photos (NoIR camera + blue filter) of the plant gradually increasing the gain of the red and gradually decreasing the gain of blue? After of this I'll check those photos by Gimp to verify the separation of red and blue channel. I could post same results here.
