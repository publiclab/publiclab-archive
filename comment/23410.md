 Hi [@divyabaid16](/profile/divyabaid16), Nice proposal though. I really liked the idea of showing the nearby content. I guess directly connecting the close button to unsubscribe button is not right as the user might just want don't want to see that note but he/she might not want to unsubscribe. So, you can just show a modal to ask him/her to unsubscribe. 

Also, there are some topics which need some more explanation. 

Otherwise, everything is alright.
Thank you!!
