Ned,
So like this.

We need to make a different file of reflectances for each filter because the filters we were using were very narrow band filters, and we want to know, e.g., how much of the red light at, e.g., exactly 660 nm was reflected off the target. I guess this will be less critical for long pass filters like Wratten 25A or Rosco [#19](/n/19), both of which pass most red and all NIR. For the Wratten filter, would you just use the visible reflectance at about 660nm, and NIR at about 750 nm?
