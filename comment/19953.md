Hi,&nbsp;[@troyb](/profile/troyb) - we do have a new Lego enclosure which is a step closer to the kind of rigidity&nbsp;[@stoft](/profile/stoft) has demonstrated in wood -- we're actually phasing out the older enclosure in favor of this very robust Lego version, and we'd be happy to offer you an upgrade kit at a discount if you're interested?
