May I ask what material your camera is housed in? Some materials have very high NDVI values, and it looks like this material is so high in comparison to the center of your image that it might be throwing the calculation off. 

I cropped your image and dropped it into Infragram, and I'm still getting really low NDVI values for the visible land. It is worth noting that areas of barren rock, sand, or snow usually show very low NDVI values (like 0.1 or less).
