Hi all- 
Update for this week, currently working on programming the stepper motor that I have from my Super Starter Kit (UNO R3 Project). I have found a youtube video along with github code that was provided and have been working on using that as practice. I have also obtained a larger stepper motor that will require research on the amount of power needed to function this motor. I have also been in search of more articles for my literature review on this topic!
