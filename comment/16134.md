I haven't had to change batteries (yet) since we set it up near the end of October...I do believe that the twice daily pic set-up is the main reason for the long battery life ( I recall the instructions noting that). It is producing what I consider to be very good quality shots( though there have been a couple of "misfires"-like the one in the middle- for whatever reason)...I'll attach a couple of THOSE shots here now. I'm convinced that this will be sufficient to gauge grossly obvious egregious or impermissible mining activity, should there ever be any.
