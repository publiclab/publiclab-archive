[@donblair](/profile/donblair), I was just reading this again, and am again impressed by your elegantly simple approach -- such a great idea! It seems like this alternating light, with signal subtraction, would work to reduce the stray light issue in [@bhickman](/profile/bhickman)'s prototype, here: https://publiclab.org/notes/bhickman/05-09-2016/turbidity-sensor.
