Hi [@iresal](/profile/iresal),
you are correct about the clock roll value being related to the integration time.  As the code is written, the integration time equals the clock roll in microseconds.  To collect all the data, the value of clock roll has to be greater than or equal to four times the number of readable elements (4964).  That makes the integration time about 15 ms.  You can make the integration time longer by increasing the value of the clock roll.  To get a shorter integration time requires some new code to employ the electronic shutter function of the ccd.
