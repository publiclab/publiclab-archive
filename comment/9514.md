Thanks mathew. In computer science, it's often taught that programming languages come and go, but clarity is always required. To that end, we would frequently have coding projects where we had to turn in just the comments of what we plan to do without any real code as the first assignment. The next assignment would be to add the code which realizes the comments.

I tend to love comments and readable code for pedagogical reasons and because I'm big into open source. Open source does not work well unless people can pick up the code and just get it.
