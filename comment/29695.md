Dr. Rick Smith did an experiment on himself to determine weather or not microplastics are in humans. He tested his own stool to determine that he does indeed have many microplastics in his body. He inferred that the types of plastics found in his stool were from plastic food packaging and clothing. The small size of microplastics enable them to be able to travel through our blood stream. This is dangerous because the chemicals used to create plastics are entering our bodies. Not only are they entering but they aren't being broken down either because they are non-biodegradable.
