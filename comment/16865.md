[@xose](/profile/xose) - i've tagged it as an activity, but if other related (next steps) activities were added, and a Q+A section, this could be the first post on a Methods page, for sure! See how we've started to build that for the https://publiclab.org/wiki/nano-data-logger -- and if you want one for the [#orange-pi](/tag/orange-pi) camera, that's a great idea!
