The linked anemometer relies on heat differential. I don't see the tech specs, but I'd be worried that in excessively hot environments the background air might not be different enough from the heat element to measure wind speed accurately. If the heating element needs to be 160 F, then maybe I take back my concern. A little black box sitting in the sun during a typical US summer could get quite hot on the inside, especially considering that the other electronics inside are going to generate heat as well.

Both the thermal and piezo anemometers are going to require active energy for measurements, which will sap batteries quickly.

Bladed anemometers are passive. In fact, you could look into a mini-turbine to generate electricity and measure its voltage. The problem with bladed anemometers is that they are going to create an accretion surface for dirt to collect on and could also impede the air flow. If you wanted to use a very small bladed anemometer, you would want to put it outside the exhaust. It would need to be cleaned every so often (unless you drop a hepa filter on the exhaust, which is a common practice for clean room particle counters).
