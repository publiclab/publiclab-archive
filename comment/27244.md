I can note that the Pis and Cameras are easily available on Amazon, and run about $25 for each part. The stages you can laser cut depending on availability in your area. The lenses themselves can be pricey, and tend to run from $20-$70 each. 
Here's are links for [10x lenses,](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G4CCB8G/ref=dp_cerb_2) for [20x lenses,](http://www.amscope.com/20x-achromatic-microscope-objective-for-compound-microscope.html) [30x lenses,](https://www.amazon.com/AmScope-Plan-Achromatic-Objective-Knurled/dp/B01G4CCFBE/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=AmScope+40X+Plan+Achromatic+Objective+Lens+with+Knurled+Ring&qid=1597784578&sr=8-1) and [100x lenses,](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G4CC4BK/ref=dp_cerb_3)
