I've been busy these days with exams.

As said I will have to contact Anish, probably look into making the upload feature as a start to begin with the coordination.

About the toggling, I've been weighing the pros and to me I don't think this feature will do any good. I'm not sure of this but can be decided later. 
Depending on the user corrections, I was also thinking it would be better to make the complete tagging inherently with EXIF(modify GPS corrections by user writing to the image EXIF).
