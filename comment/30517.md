There is potential for species to become extinct because of changes in our environment. This can happen due to a number of things such as climate, natural events, people, etc. Natural events such as tsunamis, volcanos erupting, and/or hurricanes. These types of natural events can wipe out an entire species. A lot of species cannot keep up with the climate changes in the environment and begin to start dying. 

The environmental changes are very dangerous to many species because not all species can adapt. Certain resources for species run out, making it hard to thrive- to stay alive. Burmese pythons can also play a part in the extinction of species. Burmese pythons eat animals such as raccoons, possums, and bobcats. Since they reproduce a lot, this is more the chance species can go extinct. Once a species habitat is changed, -whether it is due to humans, weather, or natural events- it is more likely for species to become extinct.
