Microplastic ingestion by humans and fish- 

It has recently been discovered that microplastics are in the belly's of deep water fish. Fish that live closer to the oceans surface are bound to eat these plastics because they are closer to these fish. But its astonishing that deep water fish are also eating these plastics. This means that the microplastics are sinking down to the oceans floor. And considering fish is a major food source for us humans, this is a big problem.
