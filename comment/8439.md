Great stuff!  We would love to see this for our local applications. Some things that would make it even more useful:
1) a scale so we can see the physical size of the area.
2) a definition of "above ambient"
3) a comparison to the predicted or reported thermal plumes that the plant is permitted for. (i.e. is this plume bigger or smaller than the plant already reports?)
