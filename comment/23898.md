Very detailed analysis ðŸ™Œ .
It is great to see the increase of contributors in different PL projects !!!
I strongly agree with the "word of mouth" concept which brings new people to the community .
I think we should work on making PL projects from friendly category to super-friendly category as it is one of the major factor which attracts people .

I think we should also try to analyze the experience of people in coding (in terms of years) prior to their first contribution to PL as well . What do you think ?

Great work ðŸ˜ƒ  !!!
