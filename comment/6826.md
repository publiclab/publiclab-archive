Definitely the IR and vis are mixing unmeasurably, but I'm wondering if the blue card contributes to the sum amount of light being reflected in the blue channel, or if it is minimizing IR (absorbing it) and giving the WB algorithm a value which really corresponds mostly to visible light, or to combined light. I guess we could explore this by calibrating with a blue card with a no-IR light vs. full spectrum light, and also by photographing the blue paper with a pure NIR cam.
