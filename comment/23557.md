 Hi [@Getty](/profile/Getty) nice proposal though. The small little optimisations you have used in your proposal is really good like the increasing of the size of the input bar of the question. 

Just wanted to tell, can you just explain the changes you are doing in people page a little bit more. That would be really convincing for those who see your proposal.

Thank you!!
