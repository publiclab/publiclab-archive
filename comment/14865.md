However, if it's possible to either turn off exposure compensation between your two scans, or to scan both spectra at the same time (side by side), you'll be able to better ensure a consistent light intensity between the samples. [@cristoforetti](/profile/cristoforetti) has been using a Raspberry Pi camera to do this.
