The original photo above has some potential for conversion to NDVI, but the red channel (NIR) is not very much brighter than the blue channel (blue) for areas of the photo with foliage (marquee):

In a photo that can be converted directly to NDVI, the NIR channel will be shifted to the right more (brighter) than the visible light channel.

I used [Ned's Photo Monitoring plugin for FIJI](https://publiclab.org/profile/nedhorning) to stretch the histograms of both channels and compute NDVI. Then I added 15 to the DNs for each pixel to get this:


[![BGNndvi.JPG](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/570/medium/BGNndvi.JPG)](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/570/original/BGNndvi.JPG)

The color key is applied to the image based on the DN for each pixel. The range of DNs from 0 to 255 translates to NDVI values of -1 to +1. The NDVI value for foliage (green) is about 0.2 which is probably too low for healthy foliage. 

What camera did you use?
