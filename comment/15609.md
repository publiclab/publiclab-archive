Scott,

There is no problem. The Mobius can do interval shooting at any interval, and it can also do motion detection. The trail camera has NIR LEDs to illuminate the scene for night time photography. These LEDs don't have to be NIR for stream monitoring -- the trail cam uses NIR so the wildlife doesn't see it and get scared. So any light source could be used with a Mobius for night time stream monitoring. 

The trail cam is already weatherproof, so no enclosure is needed. The trail cam has smart electronics so it conserves power between shots and can last for months on one set of batteries. The Mobius can also do well with power in some situations. 

Some trail cams don't cost much more than a Mobius, and they are ready out-of-the-box to deploy for weeks of 24/7 all-weather interval or motion detection shooting.
