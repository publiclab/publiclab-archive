The webcams we ordered are easy to refocus -- the glue is very soft and a hair dryer can soften it more. So it's not as much an issue for these kits. 

Yeah I don't know a whole lot about lens optics so I can't speculate... do you have an image online of it?

BTW, I tried to show the angle of the webcam as in your design, but was unable to get it to fit nicely onto a card, so I included the 45 degree guide and we'll have an illustrated guide showing how to align the camera instead.
