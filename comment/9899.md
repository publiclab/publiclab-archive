[@bgamari](/profile/bgamari) Generally speaking, we actually do track edits on research notes, but it doesn't use diff-match-patch style updates. It maintains complete copies. Using something a bit more streamlined (diff tracking, which is what git and code repos do) would be a huge improvement to the internal data store.

I actually like the idea of using git as a publication format, except for one huge caveat. Images. git and code repo engines are notoriously bad at dealing with images. Additionally, the export format wouldn't be as simple as exporting markdown diff trees (e.g. a git repo) due to the images.

However, people do indeed cram images into git repos (failing better options), and there would be nothing stopping us from doing the same. I also like this idea a lot because of the import consequences. In effect, research note pages would work very similar to GitHub Pages. You could push or pull.

To do this well, I'd recommend running git or mercurial repos on top of GridFS on top of MongoDB. The website would then extract images and markdown content directly from its local repo copy, which advanced users could update via git push (and only once keys are shared etc).

That last paragraph notes "advanced users." So here we're talking about using a code repository as the medium for publication, in effect. But what we fail to address is the tool to create the content. We'd have to come up with a way for the current editor to do all this code repo magic in the backend so that less advanced users can still participate.
