Hi JohnsonC,

That is a very intriguing chamber you have. Being able to control the spectral quality of the lighting makes some interesting things possible. Your results suggest that you are getting meaningful response to altering the color of the light. For example, 

`-Changing the blue LED settings has a big effect on a NDVI image (too low relative to IR results in image artifacting; `
`too high results in an increase in negative NDVI values)`

You found that when you flood the scene with blue light, NDVI becomes negative. This makes sense because your system uses the blue channel for visible light (VIS) when it computes NDVI, and increasing the incoming blue light will make the VIS value higher. When the VIS value is similar to the NIR value, NDVI will be near zero. When VIS is larger than NIR, NDVI will be negative. A healthy green leaf will reflect much more NIR than VIS, so if you want NDVI results similar to those derived outside under sunlight, you should adjust the lights so green leaves are several times brighter in the NIR channel than in the VIS channel. 

The webcam you are using might not allow any control over white balance, so normally it would be difficult to capture photos that allow direct computation to meaningful NDVI values. However, you have control over the color balance of the photos through your control over the spectral quality of the lighting. As you have found, altering the lighting will alter your NDVI results just as altering white balance does. So you should be able to find a color mix that produces meaningful NDVI even without controlling the camera's white balance setting. You might be confused by how changing your spectral mix affects the photos because the camera might have an auto white balance algorithm. So it might be changing the color balance to try to compensate for the changes you make. Could be fun.

One of the reasons you have not been able to capture the difference between healthy and stressed leaves is that you are using a blue filter so you are using blue light as your VIS value. The amount of blue light reflected from healthy leaves does not differ much from the amount reflected from stressed (or even dead) leaves. See this note: https://publiclab.org/notes/nedhorning/11-01-2013/why-a-red-filter-should-work-well-for-ndvi. If you use a red filter instead, reflected red light will be used as the VIS value, and you will probably get better distinction between green and yellow leaves. Stressed leaves reflect a lot more red than healthy leaves.
