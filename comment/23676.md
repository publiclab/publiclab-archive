Hi [@ishaGupta18](/profile/ishaGupta18)!!! Thanks for all your hard work. I'll go through a bit now and will add more later!

First, I think for a lot of this, it may be sufficient to just stick to line graphs for the time being. That can simplify your project, at least in the first version! 

Also, one juncture where you may want to split your work is where you upload the file, then run stuff on it, versus in some cases, where the file will already be online, and you just need to load it from a URL. If you think of your library as accepting input in 2 formats, you could have the rest of the library share code, so one might be `$('.dropzone').onDrop(function(file) { new yourCsvLibrary(file); });` (or something like that) or it might be simpler, like `new yourCsvLibrary(urlToCsv)`

Make sense?

I love how you're thinking of auto-recognizing columns. There might be a couple lines where we have to prompt:

`Select a column for labeling your graph: [select +]`
`Select a column for time: [select +]`

That said, for /some/ CSVs we could try to auto-detect which is full of timestamps... worth a try!

For time slider, try this interface out, it's pretty nice: https://oss.skylight.io/app/applications/GZDPChmcfm1Q/recent/6h/endpoints

And I believe there are lots of time slider plugins and libraries out there -- the existing really minimal graphing on PL uses Chart.js - https://publiclab.org/wiki/power-tags#Inline+graphs -- are there timeline scrolling plugins for that? (update: you're way ahead of me!!! i see you found https://github.com/schme16/Chart.js-RangeSlider/) 

One alternative view might be interesting -- a view by day, so you can see if something you are sensing for (like [#purple-air](/tag/purple-air) dust sensing) happens at the same time each day. You might see a spike on multiple graphs because a truck goes by at the same time each day. Interesting to try looking for patterns!

> Each graph plotted is given an option to be saved as an image. This makes it very convenient for the user to have the analysed data in an easy and accessible form.

I like this a lot. Some libraries like the one [@cess](/profile/cess) used on https://publiclab.org/stats allow downloading automatically. 

OK, thinking on the mailer - i wonder if it could be simpler but more powerful to prompt people to post their work as a "note" on https://publiclab.org -- because then it'd be published online, they could add a blog post around it, and people could comment on it and discuss. This already then sends email updates to people who are subscribed, so it nicely re-uses existing infrastructure!

On that theme, if you drag a CSV into https://publiclab.org/post now, you should get a short-code that shows a graph when you publish - documented at https://publiclab.org/wiki/power-tags#Inline+graphs -- so, i wonder if we really need a new table/model for it. Could we keep using the Image model, and just detect based on file type which are images and which are CSVs? What are the pros/cons here -- less to maintain, maybe, but more confusing if CSVs share a lot of systems with Images? Still, at a basic level it already works, which could free up time for you to work on other parts of this large and ambitious proposal. 

Thanks so much for your hard work on this. Your mockups and design work are tremendous! üéâ üëç
