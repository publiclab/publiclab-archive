No reason to assume that intensity is constant from 400 to 900 nm, because we apparently know that it is not:

So use a curve like this and correct a sky light spectum from your spectrometer to match it. Then use that correction on all spectra from that spectrometer. Make sure you keep white balance the same (no auto WB!) and don't over expose any peaks in any channels. I'm not really sure how to best take a spectrum of sunlight.
