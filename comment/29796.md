Yikes!! I'd definitely call. Here's a post on [method-9](https://publiclab.org/notes/gretchengehrke/02-21-2017/epa-method-9-visual-determination-of-the-opacity-of-emissions-from-stationary-sources). It includes taking measurements over time and calculating them together, so I'm wondering if it needs to be sustained.
