Hi Read! Did you have that specific Vox map link as well to also paste in here for reference? It used Leaflet, so I wanted to try to pick out the layer code. Thanks!

[@warren](/profile/warren) mentioned this convo and suggested I throw out a thing to get reactions: Mapping environmental lead exposure is an ongoing conversation happening out there; a number of people are doing it, mostly in silos (within their own city or state for example), and all trying to figure out the best variables.  I wrote up a potential project idea here: [https://publiclab.org/notes/read\_holman/01-14-2019/seeking-gis-data-folks-help-us-create-a-nation-lead-exposure-risk-map?\_=1547506494](https://publiclab.org/notes/read_holman/01-14-2019/seeking-gis-data-folks-help-us-create-a-nation-lead-exposure-risk-map?_=1547506494)  Would welcome thoughts, comments, etc (Should we actually have the conversation on that page?)
