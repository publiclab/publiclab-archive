node: Why do raw RGB values differ from calibrated RGB values? I thought calibration just set pixels to wavelength (nm)?

Ah, the table makes the values hard to see. Note for instance that a raw value of 10 scales to 7.65 while a raw values of 23, 24 and 25 scales to 22.95.  This happens with all my spectra it seems. That particular spectra is at: https://spectralworkbench.org/spectrums/137547 (and this format can be used to get to any saved spectra).
