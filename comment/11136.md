GoPro software actually contains a tool for fixing, but only if you took video.

I have written a python script to do stills from a Hero2, it would work for a Hero 3 if a lens model is made for the Lensfun database. I describe the process on my blog http://blog.wildintellect.com/blog/lenscorrect

Technically Digikam, Photivo or GIMP should be able to do it once lensfun has the camera added. However the batch in digikam is broken (1 at a time works), GIMP is also difficult to batch, and Photivo is relatively new and not widely available on many platforms yet.

Here's the code:
