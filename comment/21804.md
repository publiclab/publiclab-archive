 I took a different route.  Wanting to know when to switch on the  air purifier based on readings, I developed a micro service pulling JSON data at regular intervals and sending push notifications if appropriate.  I can set intervals (to a certain degree, PaaS limitations apply), thresholds and message. So I donâ€™t have to look at the map all the time.  Looking into Apple HomeKit with geofencing to calculate exposure averages when I am home.
