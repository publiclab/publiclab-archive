People post to facebook to get feedback. Facebook posts are not generally intended to help others. 
Editing a Public Lab wiki does not typically lead to feedback for the editor so there is little social reward. 
Is there a way to acknowledge good wiki editors? The reward does not have to be tangible.

Writing is a solo activity for me. I crave feedback when I am done, but writing by committee is beyond my ability.
