Hmmm... those are interesting!  Actually in further discussion here we came to a similar idea that if the filter/carbon/whatever filled up with material too fast you could seal it and actively pump outside air in in a sampling regime (like 2 minutes of every 60 minutes) to extend the life... similar to the systems you described.  I think that adds a lot to the design.

We had another set of ideas that also estimates weight, but in a more direct way and with a wider range of applications on a single 'scale' (ie single set of electronics and piece of quartz).  This is Robert Zegarac's idea BTW that came out of a discussion I had with him.  

Imagine a star shaped piece of quartz (or other high Q oscillating material), where the tip of each point on the start had a chemical treatment which reacted to different pollutants or chemicals of interest (obviously a lot of discussion about what that would be... I'm addressing the smirks of the chemists reading this right now :).  Each of the points on the star will add to the overall quarts oscillation in a unique way, which will come out using FFT (fast fourier transform) of the return signal.  So basically, the spikes on the FFT correspond to the points of the star, and as the points of the star change weight (ie react), the spikes on the FFT produce a corresponding shift in resonance.  (see attached image for what is hopefully a more clear description).

We discussed more elegant potentially longer term ideas (like same idea but using MEMS technology similar to that used in an accelerometer), but here's why I like the quarts idea:

1) it's human visible, and therefore it's easier to begin testing on (human beings could add the chemicals to the tips of the star, you can pick this up and assemble it by hand, unlike MEMS).

2) it's relatively low cost, and except for the question of how to get a start shaped piece of quartz, it's testable like today.

3) in the long term, once it's proven, you could move to MEMS as a lower cost, mass manufacturable version.

One could imagine choosing the 5 most important air quality components to measure, creating robust chemistries to apply to the oscillator, and using the occassional sampling method you described to have a pretty robust, easy to change, long term measuring device at relatively low cost.  Obviously technology to be developed there, but it feels like a pretty compelling idea that's in the realm of possibility.
