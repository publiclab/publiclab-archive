Believe it or not, the UNO Datalogger tutorial I posted last year has risen to the top of the traffic stats on our blog, and has generated more than a few requests for me to post a complete parts list, which I finally put together:

I'm sure there is nothing on that short list that Public Lab members don't already know, but feel free to pass the link on to any teacher friends who want to use Arduinos as part of their STEM curriculum, but are working within a very limited budget.

Cheers.
