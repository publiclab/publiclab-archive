Oh, wow, really good question! I wonder if you could combine some of the DIY microscope projects -- especially those based on the Raspberry Pi (which can do long exposures) -- with a spectrometer, perhaps building on the work by the [#webvalley](/tag/webvalley) group? I imagine you'd need really long exposures to take a spectrum of a very small thing like that.
