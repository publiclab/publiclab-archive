Presently the topic/tag blends with the rest of the body and the only thing that makes it stand out is the font size. Using an underline on the topic would make the line usage excessive.  I think using Junction Bold for the topic will immediately call the attention of the user as soon as they see the page.

You are right about making people think in terms of topic groups but I think the help text at the bottom of the input field for tags already explains to the user why they need to add topics. Also if the Share your work is to be removed I think adding a link to [https://publiclab.org/tags](https://publiclab.org/tags) on the dashboard will give users more options as to which tag/topic they would like to make a new post with so that they are not limited to only the topics they follow.
