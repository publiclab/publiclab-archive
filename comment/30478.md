Biome- a community of living things with the specific climate 
Ecosystem â€“ How the community of living things interact and correlate to each other 
The current world population is 7,969,431,900. 
Hydrosphere (water), atmosphere(air), geosphere(land), biosphere (living). 
There are about 779,719,398 without access to clean drinking water. 97% of the water on earth is salt water. Only 3% is freshwater. 540,446 people died due to water related diseases. 
Abiotic: ice, buildings 
Biotic: lion, trees 
Biosphere: animals and trees 
Hydrosphere: the ocean and dolphins 
Geosphere: mountains, grass plains 
Atmosphere: the air 
3 majors for biotic: producers, consumers, decomposers. All 3 are required for a biome to thrive.
