Ah, my apologies for getting to this conversation late. I should qualify what I'm about to say by stating that I'm no expert in chlorophyll fluorescence, either theoretically or practically, and that most of my experience comes from controlled studies of plants raised in growth chambers.

I originally started taking chlorophyll fluorescence measurements on dark-adapted leaves (taking measurements very early in the morning just before the lights were scheduling to come on), measuring Fv/Fm. Even in pretty severe drought stress treatments, we didn't see a statistically significant difference between the stress treatments and controls for Fv/Fm values. Only when damage could be readily detected visually did the Fv/Fm values tick downwards.I looked at a few other studies, and noticed that some of them also had no luck in finding Fv/Fm differences in their various treatments (perhaps it is species or treatment dependent).

At least going by the gas exchange evidence of Photosynthetic rates vs. intercellular CO2 concentrations, the actual biochemistry of photosynthesis is very resilient to stress in the sense that it doesn't accrue permanent damage easily. So, it makes sense that Fv/Fm, measuring maximal rates under ideal light conditions, would be a fairly stable, unchanging parameter. Perhaps measuring on 15-20 minute dark-adapted leaves allows a capture of mid-term photoinhibition damage that isn't seen when I dark-adapt leaves for 8+ hours.

So, I switched to phi2 measurements if only because they could give me fairly consistent differences based on treatment as long as I designed my measuring protocol well. Admittedly, in field conditions, it is a bit more difficult to achieve that same level of control in measuring conditions, and perhaps Fv/Fm shows more variability-based on treatment in field conditions as well. I'd be interested to see how these clover patches respond if the experimenters went back and took Fv/Fm measurements on them during three or four points during the night.
