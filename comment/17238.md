Awesome! I'll just copy in your notes so they're searchable on the site:

> I saw Jeff Warren’s note, so gave it a try. I’ve used some of the other tools like Gimp, PTLens, and some time ago we communicated about it. Nice result!

> I tried two photos from a Peter Swigert DJI flight in my front yard back in 3-12-15, and shared results in this note: https://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/03-17-2015/dji-uav-with-gimp-correction-of-fisheye-effect

> Issue: Full size images (Pixel Height: 3,288 Pixel Width: 4,384) gave black screen, sized to 640m processed okay, didn’t check in between

> Didn’t try tinkering with sliders to tailor for the DJI camera, just exercised the tool

> I’ve not been flying them lately, but I prefer using the non-fish eye lens configurations as discussed in this and prior notes: https://publiclab.org/notes/patcoyle/09-07-2015/mobius-non-fish-eye-and-small-lifter-wrapup

Thanks for giving it a go. It uses the web browser's WebGL system which uses your computer's graphics card to do the distortion. I don't know that all computers do this equally (esp. with higher resolution images), so would you mind mentioning what type yours was?

I'll also add a note about using different lens types, for those who choose that route, which I agree is great too!
