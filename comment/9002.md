[@erget](/profile/erget)--  are you using entirely matched stereo pairs, or are you moving to do a SFM-style unmatched parallax extraction? 

We have a big team working on completely re-writing [Mapknitter](https://mapknitter.org) this summer.  EXIF-based image placement is a central thing we're working on, which should reduce the processor intensity of doing point-cloud generation.  We see that as one of the next steps for mapknitter.  Would you be interested in working on your software in a server-side implementation?
