Why does this work when the two wires (the extension cord) are insulated? It must be that the electric field extends outside the wires into the water. Electricity is weird.

There is no power at the spring house. There is a constant flow of water like a little waterfall, so we could fix up a turbine generator. 

It might not be an important project because I already get data on the water level at the house -- when it gets low enough nothing comes out of the faucet.
