Although, the research paper you referenced at the top explains the algorithm but, try to explain it via a rough sketch/GIF/Video about the algorithm. You can also add a GIF to *matcher-core* and *matcher-cli* Readme files.

Thank you so much for your great contributions in all the projects. Your enthusiasm for JS is great. I hope, you'll motivate many new developers and contributors, and will learn more and grow more. 

Cheers!!
