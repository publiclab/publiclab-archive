I am doing about the same thing as you: use small quadcopters with small cameras with red/blue filters to analyze NDVI for small farmers. I posted my first two notes [NDVI with a key chain camera to use with a mini-drone - First steps](http://publiclab.org/notes/azaelb/04-11-2015/ndvi-with-a-key-chain-camera-from-a-mini-drone-first-steps) and [NDVI with a key chain camera to use with a mini-drone - Second steps](http://publiclab.org/notes/azaelb/04-27-2015/ndvi-with-a-key-chain-camera-to-use-with-a-mini-drone-second-steps) with subjects filled with more or less similar vegetation and too close to them. Processed images were not so resolved or detailed. I am using instead two small 1080p cameras from the type used in small spy key chain cameras. Not the best but an inexpensive beginning. I am still figuring out how to use and compare results from Infragram Sandbox and Fiji/PhotoMonitoting plugin. I really appreciate the work you are doing, it is helping me to sort some of my problems.
