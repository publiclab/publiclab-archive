[@sara](/profile/sara) and [@gretchengehrke](/profile/gretchengehrke) have mentioned the "Corrosion Coupon" badge which uses both copper and silver -- I posted a question looking for some more information about it here: https://publiclab.org/questions/warren/01-09-2018/is-there-more-information-on-the-corrosion-coupon-hydrogen-sulfide-test-kit -- any help appreciated!
