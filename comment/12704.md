I wonder, for usability, if the V piece and the M-folded piece can have slits for the attenuator in both sides as well as their being an extra cutout for the laser pen handle on both ends of the M-folded piece. This would be helpful in the case where someone aligns one or both of those pieces backwards (despite the instructions). If both of those pieces are symmetrical, then there is no orientation requirement that needs explaining and understanding. 

(Ya, I goofed, but am weary to dismantle the frame since that risks ripping the paper and making it less rigid. I'll probably just slide the attenuator in closer to where the cuvette sits.)
