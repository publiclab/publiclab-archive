You certainly can swap the second lens to shrink the thing to increase bandwidth, but decrease resolution because you are limited by pixel pitch. One of the key considerations is the number of slits in the grating you light up. More slits, more interference, the more contrast on the CCD. The laser can be replaced with a slit, and if you use cylindrical lenses it would be even smaller.
