Hi Jacob, To check for aperture you could try another EXIF reader. Maybe "max aperture" is the same as "aperture" but I have no idea. 
When working with Pix4D if you are planning on stitching NDVI images that might be problematic since it is more difficult for Pix4D to locate unique keypoints to match in adjacent images. I would like to add a feature to the photo monitoring plugin to output calibrated image bands but am not sure when I'll have time to do that. Using calibrated image bands would probably be the best approach for creating mosaicked images (RGB and NDVI) in Pix4D and other similar software. 
A 20x20 pixel ROI should be fine to calculate calibration coefficients as long as the ROIs are fairly homogeneous and without edge effects where the edges values are different from the rest of the ROI.
