 Hi [@read_holman](/profile/read_holman) - there's some information (not nearly as much as you're asking for) up at https://publiclab.org/common-water-contaminants#Lead, which maybe we should merge with https://publiclab.org/lead, what do you think? At least to consolidate what we do have on the site.
