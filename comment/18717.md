A few ideas; 

If we stopped using IFTTT to generate tweets, and did it via the API somehow, could we get the tweet ID directly that way? And if so, could we link the tweet id to the node with a node tag like `twitter:_______` maybe? 

Is 10 minutes based on a Twitter API limit? Just curious! 

For the project map work, I'm interested in hearing from [@stevie](/profile/stevie) and [@liz](/profile/liz) -- they have a lot of ideas about project and page mapping that I hope could be useful! And also see this related but old page: https://publiclab.org/places
