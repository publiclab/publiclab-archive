Do you have a data source for the intensity, pixl, wave length for the CFL in this image.  Pictures are beautiful.  I have a similar setup using some 1000 line/mm film a Canon A620, plumbing tube and fittings and razor blade for slit, and shopping bag for diffuser, some black construction paper, Ubuntu, gphoto2 (some scripts) and ImageJ.  I've found a way to identify the peaks in the data in Excel / Open Office but I don't have any calibrated CFL data points to compare to.  I've been using the same camera and Ubuntu to take astronomical photos (mainly for surveying).
