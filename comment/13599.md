Jeff, I was going to provide you with a fresh plot but unfortunately SWB still fails on Firefox -- same "left half only" spectrum with no visible data to match what shows in the image -- so, SWB remains unusable. I'll try an update and see if that helps. Otherwise, I could probably do a download of an uncorrected spectrum you wanted to use and convert that to run locally.
