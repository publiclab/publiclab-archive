Hi [@crispinpierce](/profile/crispinpierce) - that's great to hear about your interest in the SD card logging. I'll see what we can get together. 

The images showed up perfectly, and the ribbon cable looks OK. I wonder if, without a housing, it's just gotten bumped around a bit. If you want to send it back to us at:

Public Lab
55 Cromwell St 1C
Providence, RI 02907

We can replace it or fix it. Thanks!
