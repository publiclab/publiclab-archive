Does this count?  It is an operations fugitive emissions point source for Rain CII Carbon in St John Parish, Louisiana. 

I can't get within a quarter mile, this photo is from half a mile away.

I don't control when the operations happen, they happen mostly in the afternoon until early morning.

LDEQ has a Method 9 certified staff member, but i've only ever seen them dismiss complaints--LDEQ usually comes to inspect two weeks after the incident, and ~75% of the time, the facility isn't conducting the same operations two weeks later.
