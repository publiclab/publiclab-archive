Hi [@nicklasjordan](/profile/nicklasjordan)  -Just saw and responded to your GH post before I saw this note. I thought you were trying to create a Germany page and had trouble, so I plugged a template in on that page. Want to start on that one? There are a couple reasons to start with a bigger geography rather than a smaller one:: 1) you include more people, 2: it's always easier to get smaller from a geography rather than bigger. If you end up with a lot from different places that need to be represented within Germany on that page you can always break out into city pages and use /germany as a parent page for those smaller city pages :)
