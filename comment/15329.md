Another idea I had was that existing (and possibly longer) posts, rather than needing to think about which category they fit into, and how much work it'd be to revise them into fully-fledged stepwise activities, could have follow-up "responses" which distill out a portion of the original post as an activity. The smaller chunks in each activity might reflect individual categories, whereas the big narrative over-arching post would have been multiple. Then we could say "see these activities to try replicating some of the steps in the post above." 

This seems more feasible than reworking large portions of historical PL posts to fit the new activities system anyways!  And we could provide a prompt on some posts like "post a follow-up to break out specific activities from this post" or something. It won't always be the case that the original author is the one to create the activities -- someone else might try to distill out steps from the original work.
