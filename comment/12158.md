Hi ned! I would like to ask you how do you setup the camera? I have a canon power shot a490 with red filter, i try to a similar test but with bud results. How i should put the differents settings in  the camera? Automatic? Program?  Iso should be 100 ? Expouse brigghtnes? -2 or 0 +2 i 'll apreciate your opinion. I put a white paper and a black plastis maybe there are not the right materials.

regards. 
Agustin
