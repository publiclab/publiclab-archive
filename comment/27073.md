Hi all -- looking forward to Thursday. Our team was planning to follow the methods for analyzing microplastics in marine & sediment environments that are detailed in this pdf from NOAA: https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/publications-files/noaa_microplastics_methods_manual.pdf

The NOAA methods are a bit intimidating to this everyday citizen (me) who has no college level science background whatsoever -- dealing with oxidation solution that can "boil violently" if overheated and, I just noticed, needing a "fume hood". (I was already aware we need a drying oven, a dissecting microscope, a 0.1 mg balance, and various beakers, funnels, sieves, hotplate etc.)

I wonder whether there is a simpler and safer way to measure weight of microplastics per liter of water? 

We are also interested in baby legs, of course, and will give it a try, but it's my understanding we could only then report on visual qualitative analysis, not on quantitative prevalence of plastics. (right?)
