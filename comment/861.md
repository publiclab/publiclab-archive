Jeff, do you understand how silly you will look wearing these around the MIT campus?

The glasses must block most of the green wavelengths (leaving only red and blue which is why they look purple).  Healthy plants absorb most red and blue, so they look dark through the glasses.  Plants that are not photosynthezing as much will reflect more red and blue and look brighter through the glasses.  To make the most unhealthy plants look red or yellow, the glasses must transmit more red than blue.  You could make a pair of these using color slide film by taking photos of the correct color purple (or of the glasses).
