[@denissebn_06](/profile/denissebn_06) This is a great question. 

In my experience, all AQ monitors make noise. To operate, they have a fan and motor to move air through its sensors. Some, like the ones I use for outdoor air quality are quite noisy and have alarms and flashing lights for man-down alerts.

With regard to [another question](https://publiclab.org/questions/denissebn_06/05-11-2021/how-difficult-is-to-figure-out-how-to-use-air-quality-monitoring-devices) that was posted, I can do an air monitor review post and add a decibel rating for each of the monitors using an iPhone app. 

Indoor AQ monitors are usually much quieter, but do emit a low-to-slight humming noise from their internal fans. Perhaps you/one could call the manufacturers before purchasing and ask for a decibel rating?
