Here's a great resource for soil sampling. Section 8.3.2 gives a good start for a step-by-step protocol for surface soil sampling. Table 8.2 is super useful for sample holding times, how full to fill the vials, etc for different soil analyses. https://archive.epa.gov/region9/toxic/web/pdf/ee-soilsampling-sop-env-3-13.pdf
