<i>This is likely a contracted blasting service where the blasting company drills a "grid" of 5.5-6.5" bore holes (comparable to well water casings) ~75' - 90' deep, and ~20' - 25' apart.  These bore holes are then cast with ~ 125 - 250 pounds of ammonium nitrate/diesel fuel oil (ANFO) slurry charge.  Each bore hole charge is electronically time controlled to blast independently (millisecond differentials) across the established mine site grid pattern.  The old blasting system used 80% nitroglycerin with blasting caps/fuses. The intended purpose is to break apart rock layers located above the frac sand material.</i>

<i>We experienced 25 such events in 2019 alone at the Schlumberger/WI Proppants Hixton mine site.  These events create challenging air and water quality conditions on a regular basis, not to mention structural integrity issues.</i>
