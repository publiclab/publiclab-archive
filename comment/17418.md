Hi  [@david_uw](/profile/david_uw),
I am really impressed with your work :-) Very nice.
I would like to build your spectrometer.
Would you share your codes and assembling instructions ?
Did you already considered the possibility to connect your device through Bluetooth in order to use smartphone screen ?
This is the very first time I post  here.. I hope I did it right.
Thank you.
