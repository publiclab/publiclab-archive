I'm looking to test out a new board since it seems like the consensus is that the SANM isn't as good for florescence.  I'm trying to compare other SYBA webcams comparable in price but unfortunately, the specs for the former webcam, the [SYBA SY-CAM63014](http://www.sybausa.com/productInfo.php?iid=1000) do not include the the same descriptors as the ones I am looking at such as the [SYBA CL-CAM50001](http://www.syba.com/index.php?controller=Product&action=Info&Id=899). Does anyone have an opinion on which factors are making the SNAM camera less sensitive or is it a manufacturing issue of better parts or chips. I know [@matthew](/profile/matthew) mentioned that the SYBA has 2x the sensor size, but what is the descriptor that would tell you that?  Of course in the end, this might just require some good old fashioned experimentation but if you have any thoughts on what I should be looking for I'd appreciate it.

I'm also contacting SYBA
