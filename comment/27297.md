Hi Sam

Are you sure your camera's white balance is correctly set for the red filter? I'm also new to using infragram but have obtain some interesting, though not necessarily meaningful, results by selecting the RGB option and entering about 1.5 into the "R" window.  

Although reluctant to criticise such a potential valuable community research tool as infragram, I do think the application would benefit from including user instructions. This information seems currently to be scattered around general NDVI topics. 

Mike.
