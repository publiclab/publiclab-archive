Nicholas - There are a lot of how-to instructions on etching circuit boards on the Internet if that is what you want to know.  I plan on documenting how we convert the toaster oven when we get going on that.  Yes "copper" pennies only have a copper plating.  We did not etch all of the copper off a penny to get to the zinc.
