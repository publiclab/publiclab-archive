 [@Ag8n](/profile/Ag8n) , thanks so much for support and answers.  Meanwhile I also found a summary of reagents and methods based on UV/VIS spectrophotometry [[ https://www.hach.com/dr6000-uv-vis-spectrophotometer-with-rfid-technology/product-parameter-reagent?id=10239244800]( https://www.hach.com/dr6000-uv-vis-spectrophotometer-with-rfid-technology/product-parameter-reagent?id=10239244800) ]. Counting with support of a University in SÃ£o Paulo I hope we can focus on a few, but important process methods for heavy metal detection. Most important is to keep the cost down for the kit and have portable spectrophotometer equipment to collect samples at the remote locations, recording the data in our central database, using proper reagents and doing absorption readings.  Thanks for the feedback about the ANDalyze Fluorimeter process, thats a new instrument kit with a very different method. It looks interesting.
