Hello, Taylor...

...Sorry for the delay. I'd think that any quantitative analytics regarding the degree of sand removal from Sargent Sand's site would be of potentially great benefit to our group. (I have no proof, but cynically wonder if Sargent truly reports accurate mining information to the State of Michigan***it's been reported by the DEQ that Sargent supplies the data on the "honor system"***hmmm.
  That said, I'm simple a Veterinarian and a community "activist" in this quest to minimize further destruction to these irreplaceable dunes that we're all kind of fond of.
  I'd be more than willing to help YOU in anyway that I'm capable of and would at the very least, love to hear your thoughts on what type of data could be gathered and how it can help yourself (more than any other one thing) AND provide valuable data for us and groups like FracTracker Alliance that has been really interested in such information.
  Let me know if that is a giant "thud" of an invitation or if it's appealing to you in any way, okay? ( I would not be offended if it's the former).
