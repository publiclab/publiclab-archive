To be more specific ...

The goal is for the microcontroller (uC) brain (Atmel 328p), and the sensor boards it connects to, to be running at 3.3V. That way all the signal levels will match.  

So, whatever voltage comes into the board (assuming above 3.3V), it needs to be dropped down to 3.3V. 

This is done with a linear dropout regulator (LDO) -- it takes whatever voltage V_in and drops it down to whatever voltage it is designed to generate (in our case 3.3V). 

So, the way I'm thinking of taking in voltage to the board via various power sources, and generating 3.3V on the board, is as follows:

I'm adding a general "through hole" pair of +/-, so that if folks want to use something other than a JST connector, they can easily.  Because it's easy to mix up +/- on that connector, I'm putting a diode in front of the positive terminal, in case someone goofs up.  I'm not worried about USB or JST -- they're both polarized connectors so you can't plug something in wrong.
