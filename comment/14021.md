This is great. Jeff is right that you need a post processing routine to learn if you captured anything interesting. In fact did you look closely at frame 197?

I bought a few of those boost converters on ebay where they cost $3.00. So far one of them is junk and one really works supplying 5.2V even from three eneloops (3.6V). The third hasn't arrived yet. I was hoping one would output 6V to run the SkyShield, but the commodity versions are all designed to charge devices with 5V. Pololu has [one that will output 6V](https://www.pololu.com/product/791) but it's $12.00. Pololu also has [one that outputs 5V](https://www.pololu.com/product/2116) for $4.00
