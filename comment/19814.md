It is common for focus to be poor after the internal IR cut filter is removed or replaced. To make those modifications, the plate holding the camera sensor must be removed by unscrewing a few small screws. The tightness of those screws determine the position of the sensor which is critical to focus. Unless a thick filter is installed to replace the IR cut filter, it is almost always possible to adjust those screws so the camera focuses well again.
