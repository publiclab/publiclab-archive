Absolutely, I should have mentioned them.  Here are two:

* $26 [Ambient Weather WM-35](http://www.ambientweather.com/amwm2.html) (discontinued, new model is WM-2), has no recording functions
* ~$100-150 [Brunton ADC Summit](https://www.brunton.com/products/adc-summit) cheapest I've seen with recording functions
