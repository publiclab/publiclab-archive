The camera I ended up using was the camera for pi zero with infra-red filter (https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-camera-module). With the centre line, it's more that the line is there to allow the user to line up where the spectrum is on the screen, the line of pixels directly below the white line is what the script stores. With mine it's a case of nudging the spectrometer left or right until I'm happy and then hitting the spacebar to capture.

Let me know how running the code goes, especially any bugs.
