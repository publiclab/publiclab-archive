The Basic Microscope Kit is an introductory Do-It-Yourself microscope made from affordable and easy to find parts. It's based on [the Hackteria microscope](https://publiclab.org/notes/partsandcrafts/10-26-2017/making-a-hackteria-microscope), the OpenFlexure Microscope, and @maxliboiron's work at http://CivicLaboratory.nl ( #13503 ), among other sources.

## Goals

This project was started as a collaboration between Public Lab and [Parts & Crafts](http://partsandcrafts.org). The goals of the project are:

1. offer a very easy starting point for DIY microscopy
2. act as a stepping-stone to more advanced DIY microscopes
3. be as affordable and simple as possible while still providing great microscopic images
4. be good enough to view 2-5 micron size particles (see [sample images below](#Sample+images))

##About the parts


### General parts list

* a lens (objective)
* a [Raspberry Pi](/tag/raspberry-pi)
* a [Raspberry Pi camera](/pi-camera)
* a light source
* a rigid stage to connect these all together

###Example parts list for building a Basic Microscope:
