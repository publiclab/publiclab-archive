###Public Archive###

* Our first printed map
  * Interview: # of words (500-700 or 1400/2000) -- jeff does typographic magic, shannon cuts or tries to
* June 3rd -ish launch date for online archive
  * Jeff has to format the individual map pages with an embedded viewer, Cartographer and Mapper notes,  etc.
 * consider nice embedded map interface like this example: http://mapbox.com/#/tileset/natural-earth-2 
 * Stewart will begin inputting the maps collection into the system
* accuracy statement? -- “what makes this map unique?”, “how does this compare to other maps?”, scale and precision, something about subjectivity...

* Kickstarter for Grassroots Mapping “Oil Maps” exhibition, etc:
  * Ask for 20k? 25?
  * $300? some level where you get to host the exhibition in a space of your choosing. This must be worth the cost of shipping
  * Shipping the prints: $? find out cost; estimate $50x # of locations?
  * Printing with UV-resistant dyes on recyclable Tyvek: $1500
  * Printing a couple print map editions: $2000
  * Map archival preparation, publishing, server costs
  * A book of essays and 12 maps in a printed collection, (printing as we go, later approaching a publisher)
  * Digital copies in libraries
  * a MapMill kiosk and/or a map viewing installation

###Collaborations###

* Jeff needs to announce P&C spectrometer on the mailing list - with link to purchase

* agree upon and post the Creative Commons licenses for the site & materials
* Mikel’s questions about UNICEF & JA
  * Jeff needs to call JA and clear things up, and make sure that this really is/would be a grassroots mapping balloon mapping project, and not an attempt to get us to do Map Kibera
* Shirley- waiting still, contacted her this week, been waiting 3 weeks, possible restructuring

###PLOTS: the organization###

* Mathew followup on decision making -- need to agree on a technology (selectricity or google docs, or what) and a set of thresholds for what levels of majority are needed for what types of decisions
