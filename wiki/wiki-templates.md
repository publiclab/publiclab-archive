This page has templates that can be used to create new wikis. Click edit on the page and copy the template you'd like to use for posting a new page! Feel free to adjust the template on your new post to suit your specific need. 

`tagname` note: on each of these templates you will see spots that say `tagname`. A tag is a useful tool on Public Lab to help organize material. For each one of the templates below, you will need to create a tag that you'd like to use and replace all the `tagname` text on the template with the tag you've chosen. The tag you choose should be the "key word" or words for the topic of the post (note that if it's more than one word, it will need to be hyphenated). 

Any material on Public Lab that has the tag you choose will be funneled to your page as supporting or related material. If you want something that's unique to your page (say a specific project) choose a unique tag (such as `chicago-petcoke`).
