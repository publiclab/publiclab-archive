###Questions###
* Retail report done?
  * wednesday due
* Final receipts?
  * retail receipts still need organizing, right? -mathew
* Jeff- accounting questions? - upon return to MA
* next kickstarter -- point person? Jeff can do the video... but doesn't want to run the campaign.
  * thermal flashlight 
  * Look at these as full/part time staff) roles: 
    1. video: 1 month, october -- Jeff
    1.  bulk ordering/sourcing and assembly (6 months) -- sourcing and pricing for 100, 1000 or 10,000 units known before launch
    1.  updates/promotional events (40 days)
    1.  comments and messages (3-6 months) 
    1.  outreach to blogs and press (40 days)
    1. Fulfillment of rewards 
  * Thursday- deadline for decision
    * i said i think we can ship an arduino-based kit by christmas but we can debate that. A custom and completed device, definitely not. More like March/April. But we can ship a certificate or something earlier.
    * what if its a different person running the campaign? i mean so peeps dont think we are launching a new one before shipping the next one
    * another thought -- just sell an arduino shield as base reward
    * and not sure if we can wait another year for cold weather
    * we don’t have to do another kickstarter for months, dont worry! this one is a much simpler project
    * that’s the “completed device” version. a “kit” would be the early-shipping version
      * http://thermographer.publiclaboratory.org - and pre-calibration idea -- “hold up the flashlight to the camera to “read the calibration””
    * no, 3+ per year kickstarters is good idea - lets

 * Membership
 * Staff meeting form
