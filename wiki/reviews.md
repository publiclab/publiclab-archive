**Hello and welcome!** üëãüèª üéâ Thanks for visiting and learning more about Public Lab‚Äôs organized research activities.

On this page, you‚Äôll find information on Research Area Reviews, which are ways we work together to grow and organize shared knowledge on [environmental topics](https://publiclab.org/topics) at Public Lab.

## What are research area reviews for?

Anyone can come to Public Lab to learn about an environmental topic and find information on accessible, do-it-together tools for investigating local environmental concerns.

**Research Area Reviews aim to keep information on environmental topics up-to-date, organized, and useful for community scientists** ü•Ωüìù. There are already many fantastic resources on community science methods out there‚Äìour aim is to uncover, collect, build upon, and contextualize these resources so that people can **see a pathway for researching their local environmental concern**. If there are resources we think are important but can‚Äôt find, we sometimes also develop them. For more details, see ‚Äú[What happens during a review?](https://publiclab.org/wiki/reviews#What+happens+during+a+review?)‚Äù

üéà **This is a collaborative project!** Many people bringing their own lived and learned experiences on a topic leads to richer resources and conversations that more people can learn from. 

üíÅüèΩ **And there are many ways to participate!** Anyone can contribute while also building their own knowledge and experience on a topic. See ‚Äú[Join us](https://publiclab.org/wiki/reviews#Join+us!)‚Äù below for more!

## What happens during a review? 

The overall process for a Research Area Review roughly follows the outline below. They‚Äôre currently coordinated by @bhamster and a stellar team of [Research Curation Fellows](https://publiclab.org/wiki/research-curation-fellows) üëãüèΩ. We aim for a balance between structure to keep us on track and flexibility to enable all kinds of contributions and ideas to take shape.

**Review process**

Research Area Reviews currently happen every three months, cycling among the larger topics of air, water, land/soil, and organizing and advocacy. For each three-month review period, we choose an environmental topic to review under the larger topic for the quarter. In choosing a topic, we consider those that Public Lab community members are actively working on and topics that are in need of a little extra attention.

_**Kicking-off a review:**_

+ To start a review, we hold a public kick-off call to welcome people to the review process, talk about how to get involved, begin conversations about the review topic, and help shape the direction of the review.

_**During a review:**_

+ We surface and post questions on the topic by examining existing resources and listening to people working on the topic;
+ We talk with people to find answers to these questions;
+ We also talk with people to learn and document their experiences with the topic;
+ We research and post information on accessible methods and tools and their uses for community science;
+ We create step-by-step activities for getting started with community-led research on the topic;
+ We outline next step challenges in tool development and research on the topic;
+ We collect and organize these questions, activities, and other resources on a collaborative wiki page.

_**Wrapping up a review**:_

+ We hold a public event to share our findings, talk about remaining questions and ideas for next steps, and welcome anyone new to the refreshed resources;
+ We post a summary of the review, including links to updated resources, recordings of events, and shout-outs to all who contributed.

üí° **If you‚Äôre interested in contributing to any part of this process, [check out the contribution guidelines here](https://publiclab.org/wiki/contributing-to-reviews)!**
