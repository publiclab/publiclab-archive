  * Sara is speaking on a panel about science and information around hydraulic fracturing, she along with discussing webtools for community monitoring of the oil and gas industry she will discuss the possibility using Public Labâ€™s grassroots mapping tools to document the expansion frontier of natural gas development in the US.
  * Panel Abstract: We often see debates between experts on scientific issues that affect our lives and livelihoods. What can we do when the experts disagree but their decisions have enormous impacts on us? Do we try to influence their debate? Do we trust one side? Do we trust our gut feelings? Hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus Shale has recently brought up these questions and issues. Join a panel discussion with speakers from a number of fields and disciplines who will help us understand the way we access and understand information and help us apply lessons learned from history in our decision-making process.
