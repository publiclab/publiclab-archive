###About the Barnraising 
A Barnraising is an event hosted by the Public Lab community. In the spirit of bringing a community together to collectively raise a structure such as a barn, Barnraising participants come together to test environmental monitoring tools in the field, brainstorm new research projects, share about environmental concerns, and develop strategies to address them. The event is hosted in an “unconference style.” This means that people collectively set the agenda, and join to participate and collaborate rather than just present, talk, and listen.  

At the event, barnraising participants can expect to: improve social ties through in-person collaboration, participate in deep exploration of local environmental issues and ongoing community research, advance technical knowledge, and work with hands-on projects for local environmental monitoring and documenting new monitoring methods.

###Registering for the Barnraising

####Registration and closing dates
**Full Registration** for this event includes housing, and all meals between Friday breakfast and Sunday lunch. Registration for this ticket will close **February 17th.** _(If you do not require housing, please indicate that on your registration form or email stevie@publiclab.org.)_ 

**Single Day Ticket** If you are just planning on joining this event for one day, we recommend Saturday. Single day tickets cover breakfast and lunch for the day you will be joining the event. Registration for this ticket will close **February 19th.**

####Event costs and discount options
**Registration Costs:** Each year we work hard to make this event accessible for everyone to attend. In that respect, every Barnraising event is run on a sliding scale cost for registration. While the Registration cost is listed at $50 ($20 for single day), this event costs us much more to put on (around $40,000). If you are able to pay more, please include more funds through the donation option or through the institutional support button at the end of the registration form. If the event cost is more than you can cover, please email stevie@publiclab.org for discount codes for free or reduced registration. 


###Logistics

**Event times and location:** The Barnraising will begin on Friday, February 22nd at 9 a.m., and end the afternoon of Sunday, February 24th. The event will be hosted at the historic Ashton Villa in Galveston, Texas (2328 Broadway Avenue J, Galveston, TX 77550). On Sunday morning after breakfast, the event will conclude in Houston, as we work with local partners exploring local environmental issues and practicing our environmental fieldwork methods and tools. 

**Housing:** Housing for the Barnraising is included in registration for those who are joining for the full event. We will be staying in several houses we have rented out near the event. In this housing arrangement, bathrooms, and in some cases, bedrooms will need to be shared (no bed sharing!). If you prefer your own room, or require other housing considerations such as wheelchair accessibility, please indicate that on your registration or email stevie@publiclab.org. **If you do not require housing, please let us know!**

**Transit options:** We will have large vans available to pick people up at the airport and in Houston on Thursday before *7:30pm* (city pickup locations yet to be determined). The vans will be returning to Houston on Sunday around 11 a.m. If you require transit outside those times, please make personal arrangements.
