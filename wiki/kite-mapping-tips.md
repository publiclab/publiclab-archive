# Kite Mapping Tips

##tips for trouble-free kite mapping

**Note:** _This is **NOT** a guide for "expert" kite flyers. It's intended to be a QUICK START guide for people who've never kite mapped before, with as few problems and things to worry about as possible._

###Equipment & Conditions

**Check the wind** - don't fly balloons if it's windy; don't fly kites if it's calm or **very** strong! ([Weather Underground](http://preview.wunderground.com/) has an hourly wind forecast)

|  0 mph  |  5 mph  | 10 mph | 15 mph | 20 mph
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| balloon | either | 9 ft kite | 7 ft kite | don't fly 

**Use a delta kite** - regular, simple triangular kites as pictured below.  Nine foot (2.7m) wide for light wind, seven (2m) for stronger winds

**Use a tail** - put a 20 foot long FUZZY TAIL (ribbony, [as seen here](http://store.publiclab.org/products/kite-mapping-pack), or [make your own](/wiki/en/fuzzy-tail-kites)) on your kite. It will keep it stable and stop it from diving.

**Recruit kite flyers** - 8-year-olds and 80-year olds know more than the rest of us

### Where to Fly

**pick a takedown area**
Turbulent air currents will bring your kite down when it is low, 15-75' up, plan space for this to happen.

**Learn when to quit.**
If the weather looks bad, don't fly.  Start pulling in string at the first sign of trouble.

###Launch & Flight

**Use gloves** - made of cloth or leather for string burns. No rubber!

**Running is unnecessary** - quickly get your kite up into strong, clean air: work with a partner to walk out 100 feet of tensioned line. Let go of the kite and either pull the line in or walk upwind slowly.

**Climb the kite with even tension** - if the kite pulls, let it climb up and away from you.  Give it as much line as it needs to keep climbing, and an even amount of tension for stability.

**Do a test flight** - with no camera, to test the conditions.  Find the height where your kite is fairly stable. On the next flight, attach a camera at or below this point on the line.

**Use ALL your string** - fly high! 1000-2000 feet: one large photo of your whole site is far better than 20 you'll have to stitch together later!

###When In Doubt, Let Line Out

**Learn to recover from dives** - If the kite dives sideways or downward, let out line until the kite rights itself. Don't pull!  

**have a crash plan** -carry a knife. If a kite is crashing across a path or road let the line tension out and cut the line.  Run along the line and cut it off the path.
