This page collects resources related to the recent wave of #GoPro -like mini cameras that often have features like:

* waterproof and impact-resistant cases
* WiFi connectivity
* light weight (~50-60 grams)

These cameras vary widely in quality, from excellent (#GoPro cameras themselves, or #GitUp cameras which can do 4k with very clear crisp imagery) to [relatively low quality](/questions/warren/05-20-2017/cheap-lightweight-gopro-alternatives-for-aerial-mapping) which may still be useful depending on your use case and budget.

The Public Lab Store carries a few models:

* [the GitUp](https://store.publiclab.org/products/gitup-action-camera)
* a generic [waterproof mini-camera](https://store.publiclab.org/waterproof-mini-camera)

We also strongly recommend #pi-camera options based on the Raspberry Pi camera, especially for #infragram multispectral photography:
