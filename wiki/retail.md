**GMF workflow:**

* divide up grid, pass out google docs to contributors.
* How do we launch GM Forum all at once, with retail-- i.e. donation levels from GM Forum up to balloon and spectrometer kits.
		
Adam- don’t lose gifts that are donations to our organization that are tax-deductible, this is our big push and make it clear that we can receive donations.

Are people “backers” also members of PLOTS?

* reward can be “membership” -- find out legally what “membership” means
* “membership” vs. being part of the Plots community? - “member of the plots ….” - use Kickstarter’s “backers”, makes people seem like “investors” -- rather than charity-givers/donaters
