**VALUES**

**JUSTICE:** We support the health and wellbeing of communities and their environs, especially those disproportionately impacted by social and environmental harm. Local knowledge and leadership are central to the movement from unjust to just.

**RESPECT:** We see our varied backgrounds and experiences as strength, and treat each other and ourselves with kindness, care, and dignity. We take personal responsibility for building an equitable, collaborative movement.

**OPENNESS: **We commit to sharing our work, incorporating new ideas, and amplifying the efforts of others to accomplish our common goals. We work in ways that encourage others to join in at any moment.

**INTEGRITY:** We value rigorous science and commit to ethical, honest, high-quality work. We strive for goodness in ourselves as individuals and as an organization.

**EXPLORATION:** We are curious and creative, embracing wonder as we re-imagine our relationship with the environment.

_These values were created through a series of work sessions and drafts by Public Lab staff in 2016._
