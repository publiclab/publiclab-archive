Public Lab is working on a campaign to relaunch our Balloon Mapping Kit, and to that end we're hoping to round up images and/or video showcasing your kite and balloon photography over the years! 

We'd love to see documentation of all kinds of projects: large-scale research missions, backyard surveys, successful (or unsuccessful) experimentation, works in progress, or anything else you can think of that gives insight into aerial mapping and your work with the process. Completed maps and action shots of mapping teams are all welcome! As long as you put something up in the air (or TRIED to put something up in the air), we'd love to take a look. 

Feel free to post photos, videos, links, and any commentary you wish directly into this post or the comments. Many thanks!
