# SNUT balloon mapping video

Hello, Public Laboratory. 
Last year, I got a video for the other people who want to get picture by balloon. It was not complete, but I think It is useful for beginner.

I'm going to make Korean tutorial about balloon mapping, and I hope more people try to balloon mapping at S.Korea.
