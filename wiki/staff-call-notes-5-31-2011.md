(Stewart and Jeff present)

###Public Archive###

* Posters!!! 
  * edit cycle more efficient, firmer deadlines, much less protracted feedback/edit period
  * new publishers? not returning calls
  * name suggestions? “Grassroots Mapping Forum”, “Grassroots Mapping Reader”, 

* online archive feedback from C4 meeting, lots to do
  * permalinks for map views - scroll to one location in the map, and embed just that view
  * new view template for a full-screen embeddable map, that reads the hash permalink
  * timeline view (maybe just for nearby maps) that loads other layers
* remove zooming/scrolling in /maps
* sort-by “state name”, recency, license? date?
* search maps: http://publiclaboratory.org/search/node/type:map%20chandeleur

###Fundraising###

* Lindbergh grant (jeff is back online after weekend and will help out where possible, tell him what to do)
* set up bank account for SIP (and others)
  * backup plan for SIP, put it in Shannon’s account, then a new WePay account, open a nationally-available account after a little more deliberation (Chase, BoA)

###Field work this week###

* Adam, UV/IR camera late - arrives maybe by Friday? too bad
* Shannon, Bayou Dularge, LSU

###Collaborations###
