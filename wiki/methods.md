The word "method" has different meanings in different spheres, at Public Lab we use it to mean any technique, approach, or set of techniques to achieve something. You can see a selection of them at the [Methods page](/methods), or post a new one using the instructions here:

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="/wiki/new?n=14552&title=Your method name here">Post a new method here</a>

## What goes into a method page

Briefly, a method page could contain:

* A one-line introduction to the method or set of methods
* Context and background on the method
* Questions and a prompt to add your own
* Activities to guide people to how to begin using or contributing to the project

A **much** more complete description of methods [can be found here](https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/12-07-2016/post-a-new-method-to-publiclab-org).
