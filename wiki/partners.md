_Thanks to the collaboration and support with the following organization and individuals, the work of Public Lab is made possible._

###Public Lab Partnership Statement: 
At the Public Lab nonprofit, we see partnership as a process by which we work to build alliances, strengthen mutual capacities, develop opportunities, and work in healthy relationships with other groups and institutions.

In our partnerships, we value mutual trust, respect, and transparency.

Through partnerships we seek to:

- Share and exercise a commitment to learning,
- Recognize and celebrate organizational autonomy and independence, and
- Practice clear, constructive, and where possible, outward facing* work and communications.

We recognize healthy partnerships have:

- Clearly defined goals and expectations,
- A balance of power through equitable distribution of responsibilities, resources, management, and attribution, and
- A mutually created, and agreed upon process for decision making, accountability, and closure.

In partnerships, we commit ourselves, and call on our partners to:

- Celebrate and publicly recognize our independent and mutual achievements.
- Share appropriate resources, and
- Work in good faith, and with best intentions.

The Public Lab nonprofit reserves the right to withdraw from relationships that violate our [code of conduct](/conduct), go against our [values](/public-lab-nonprofit-values), are tangential to our [mission](/mission), or do not adhere to the above statements.

Footnote:

_*We value public facing communication for its ability to increase transparency and stem inclusive dialogue. However, we recognize that many types of communications, especially those in relation to human health and safety, require discretion and protection of privacy._
