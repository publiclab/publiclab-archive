This page collects efforts to develop a Raspberry Pi (#raspberry-pi) based spectrometer, building on Public Lab (and others') open source [DIY spectrometer designs](/wiki/spectrometry).


## Design goals

The Raspberry Pi camera (especially the version 2 camera) is very sensitive and good resolution, very inexpensive (<$20), has very low baseline noise, and is extremely configurable. 

## Software

You can now [download ready-to-use camera software on our Pi Builder page](/pi-builder).

## Questions

Questions can be either frequently asked questions, or "next step" challenges we're looking to solve.

[questions:raspberry-pi-spectrometer]

## Activities

Activities show how to use this project, step by step.
