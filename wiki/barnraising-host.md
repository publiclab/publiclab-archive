## About Barnraisings:

#### What makes a Public Lab Barnraising? 
There are several important traits that all Public Lab events have. If you’re coming to an event for the first time, they are things you can expect to happen, and what makes a Public Lab event unique. 

All Public Lab events:

- Follow the [Public Lab Code of Conduct](https://publiclab.org/conduct),
- Create learning moments,
- Level the playing field for people to participate,
- Increase collective understanding of environmental issues and community science,
- Allow space for people to think and act creatively, use available resources, and move towards action.

A Public Lab Barnraising is unique in that it also follows the principles of Open Space Technology ([read more here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1erkclv17M25gp_NOBb2XiIkqajssBO2kN_VWYENlgK4/edit)):

- Every person here is the right person
- Whatever happens is the only thing that could have
- Be prepared to be surprised
- Whenever it starts is the right time
- The Law of Mobility -- _meaning, everyone is responsible for using their own judgement in moving to where their time will be best spent._ 

Together, these guiding principles help to create the space for the unique and genuine collaboration that Barnraisings have!

#### Why host a Barnraising? 

Sharing a physical space with others can be extremely productive and rewarding. Barnraisings, in particular, help people to share and build knowledge with others.  Barnraisings have been known to help people:
 
- connect with others and build social bonds,
- dive into local issues,
- share a physical space to be creative, and
- work on projects, and bring newcomers in. 

At a Barnraising, agenda-setting power is moved to the participants. We all come to the space with our own ideas and interests on what we would like to do, and through a facilitated process, actually set the schedule together. This means that everyone who is there is part of the process of deciding what happens with the shared time and space.
