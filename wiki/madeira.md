## Multispectral imaging

The [Infragram project](/infragram) brings together a range of different efforts to make Do-It-Yourself plant health comparisons possible with infrared photography. Vineyards, large farms, and NASA all use near-infrared photography for assessment, usually by mounting expensive sensors on airplanes and satellites. Infrared analysis is used for a variety of things, but most focus on assessing plant health, such as:

* to assess crops and #agricultural practices
* better #soil management (reducing #fertilizer, soil treatments)
* in #wetlands analysis

## Spectrometry

The Public Lab [spectrometry project](/spectrometry) is an open source community effort to develop low-cost spectrometers for a range of purposes. Our most recent projects are the [Lego Spectrometer Kit](/lego) and the [Papercraft Spectrometer Kit](/paper-spec).

## Microscopes

The [Basic Microscope Kit](/basic-microscope) is an introductory Do-It-Yourself microscope made from affordable and easy to find parts. Our goal is to measure #silica particles in the air, #microplastics, and other things using a simple-to-assemble kit.

## Hydrogen Sulfide

The [Hydrogen Sulfide Copper Prototyping Kit](/hydrogen-sulfide-copper-pipe) is a new project looking at whether burnishing copper can be used as a means to measure the presence of toxic hydrogen sulfide gas. This is an early prototype which needs a lot of work on initial kit design and testing:
