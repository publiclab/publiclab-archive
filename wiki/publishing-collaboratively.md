This page is all about finding new (and old) collaborative means to publish the scientific research done by the public lab community.  This page will most likely include several discussions including research note workflows, reproducibility, what is publishing and where to publish research etc.... This page can also serve as a resource for the tools and findings about open publications.

###Research Note Workflows:
[A fabulous research note and video tutorial](http://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/08-11-2014/research-note-workflows) by [donblair](/profile/donblair) and [walkerjeffd](/profile/walkerjeffd) about publishing research note workflows.  This page generated lots of discussion.

###Tools

Lots of great resources found from the [Mozilla Science github repo](https://github.com/mozillascience/publishing-with-git).

###Example Publications
