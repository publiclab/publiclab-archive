###Adhesive options

Here's a list of other adhesives and tape strips which may be helpful in assembling and mounting the spectrometer. Some may be shipped in the kits:

* Tape strips are sold for costumes and wigs: http://www.amazon.com/Bonding-Double-Tape-Walker-Straight/dp/B00D7LA162/
* 3M's super strong 300LSE in letter sheets, ~$12 each: http://www.amazon.com/9474LE-super-strong-double-sided-adhesive-transfer/dp/B00CCGK31G/
** these are an excellent option.  3M sells [24x36" sheets](http://multimedia.3m.com/mws/mediawebserver?mwsId=66666UF6EVsSyXTtlxTV5XM2EVtQEVs6EVs6EVs6E666666--) somewhere.  we can save users any trimming through cutting to 6mm wide-- the width of the edges of the mountplate.  one sheet = 300 30cm strips 6mm wide, giving each user 6 5cm pieces they can cut to length with their razor.  Then there's no tape trimming to do when attaching.
* Scrapbooking tape strips: http://www.amazon.com/Double-sided-adhesive-mounts-12-pack/dp/B00D5WDZXO/ (hard to find but good size -- big lots available on ebay: http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-72-Packs-Scrapbook-Double-Sided-Adhesive-Strips-/321157403796 is 3600 strips for $65, or 2c per strip)
