The project will use environmental sensors connected via mobile networks to generate indicators of water quality in cities in the Brazilian Amazon. Starting in December, 2015, the project will inform people on the quality of water, reducing water contamination by disease and environmental degradation. The goal is to provide real-time data on contamination of water tanks. The data collected by this network of sensors will be distributed to the government, citizens and non-governmental organizations through the alert system for mobile phones (SMS) and web mapping applications.

##Information flow

- The equipment measure the levels of different parameters each hour, sending the data to a server.
- The server show graphics in realtime and a WQI to make simpler for the online public to understand.
- An analyst will look for the levels of the different parameters from time to time.
- If the analyst find and something that needs to be checked, s/he contacts the volunteer responsible for the equipment, to make lab analysis and uploading the data to the server (that also will create graphs).
- If the lab analysis indicates that the water can be contaminated, the analyst will send a message (SMS) for the people inscribed to receive info about the water quality in this specific place, saying that there's a possibility that the water is contaminated and recommending change the water source.

All the volunteers will receive the equipment and an mobile lab analysis kit as donation. S/he will be trained to make maintenance in the equipment  and to make the lab analysis.

##Hardware

You can find information about the hardware [Mãe d'Água](http://publiclab.org/wiki/mae-d-agua) wiki page.
