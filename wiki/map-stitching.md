Once you get aerial imagery from a balloon or airplane, you can 'stitch' it into a flat map in a number of ways. This helps to overlay your data on other maps, to correlate information, and can be the first step towards [creating NDVI](/tool/infrared-camera) or other image analyses.

Ray Cha and Jeff Warren are currently developing a tutorial to guide first-time map stitchers. You can find the work-in-progress here:

It may eventually become a PDF, video, and/or web page. Contact the mailing list at https://groups.google.com/group/publiclaboratory to get involved.
