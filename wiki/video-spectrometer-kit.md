_This page is out of date; please see the [store](/store) for details, or the [video spectrometer page](/wiki/video-spectrometer)_

This page details the upcoming mail-order kit for the [video spectrometer](/wiki/video-spectrometer) which PLOTS will be selling.

At cost this spectrometer is $34 shipped. I hope to bring that down to between $13-$16 shipped with a cheaper camera. In order to support more research, I propose a cost of $50 for the current model, dropping to $30 for a cheaper camera.

* double sided tape
* velcro tabs
* webcams
* VHS boxes
* black card stock (letter size yields 2 kits)
* laser cutting for the inserts
* drilling for the slot holes
