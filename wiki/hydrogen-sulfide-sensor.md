### Arduino-based sensor prototype 

Our first prototype used a digital sensor for hydrogen sulfide connected to an #arduino. Advantages of this system is that data from the sensor could be logged over time and that tool is reusable and portable. However the [Figaro TGS 825 sensor](http://figarosensor.com/gaslist.html) itself is relatively expensive--approximately $60 for an individual sensor and $40 in bulk.
