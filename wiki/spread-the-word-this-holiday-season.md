##Email
**Sending a personal email to your friends, family, and colleagues is a great way to share why Public Lab's work is so meaningful to you. Create your own personal message, or use this message to get started:**

_Despite recent environmental successes, we live in a world where the very notion of “science” is under threat. Storms continue to increase in intensity, and deregulation means that industrial polluters have little oversight. As always, historically disadvantaged communities are the most deeply impacted._

   _To create a more equitable world, we need to ensure that all people have access to science. We need science and technology to report the changes we see in our backyards so we can protect ourselves, our families, and our neighborhoods._

   _That’s why I support Public Lab and its mission to educate and connect a new movement of scientists and advocates, so that all among us have a voice, the tools to collect data, and the power to protect and preserve our communities._

   _This holiday season, will you join me in making [a tax-deductible donation](https://publiclab.org/donate) or [donating a DIY science kit](https://store.publiclab.org/products/donate-a-kit) to someone who might not be able to afford it?_
