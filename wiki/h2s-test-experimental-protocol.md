1. Locate a good point source

2. place canisters close to, a medium distance and far away from that source, in a ring around the source.

3. place draeger tubes co-localized with at least 3 samples strips at each level, close, medium and far way.

4. Leave for a set window
12 hours
24 hours
1 week.

Need 10 canisters for each ring- of strips- 3 draeger tubes co-located with the strips on each of the rings- could get a map back that we can make around this source.

Canisters numbers and correlated with a map- cap all of them and send to wherever they are. 

Dots to show change in color of the paper- also can use as labels
