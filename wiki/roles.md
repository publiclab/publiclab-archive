The Public Lab website (this site!) has a feature known as "roles" for different people -- enabling some to act as [moderators](/wiki/moderation) and some to act as admins.

## Moderators

Moderators can approve (or mark as spammers) first-time posters and their notes, delete comments, and moderate specific wiki page revisions. To become a moderator, see the [Moderation page](/wiki/moderation)

See a list of moderators here: https://publiclab.org/users/role/moderator

## Admins

Admins can, for reasons of safety, privacy, or with the author's permission, edit other peoples' posts, and can permanently delete wiki pages and comments. They can also do everything moderators can do.
