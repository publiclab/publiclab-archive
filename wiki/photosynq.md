Welcome to PhotosynQ!

Prefer video tutorials?  Go to PhotosynQ’s youtube channel for full tutorial videos to get you up and running faster than a bamboo shoot on a sunny day! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvJrVf_OUX8ukD01AjmDwSg


Step 1: Collect Data
I have a Android smartphone (Honeycomb 3.0 or better)

Find and install the PhotosynQ app in the google play store.  Complete the tutorial which begins when app starts.


I have a PC, Mac, or Linux and Google Chrome browser

Install Google Chrome. Then download the PhotosynQ Chrome app from:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore

Open the app, and complete the tutorial.  

Step 2: Explore Data
In your computer’s web browser, go to www.photosynq.org/discover and select the project you contributed to.  Click on the ‘dashboard’ link on the left hand side of the project page.  Be patient, mammal - it may take some time for the data to load!  Once loaded, you can map the data, compare results on the X and Y axis, view the distributions of results, and more!

For a full tutorial of the online data analysis tool, go to: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvJrVf_OUX8ukD01AjmDwSg

Step 3: Contribute to Science!

Now that you understand the basic idea, you can find a project to take part in at www.photosynq.org/discover.  You can collect data, analyze results, and add to the discussion on the comments thread.  

Or you can create your own project at www.photosynq.org/projects/new.
