# SEM stub monitor for particulate matter

In field testing, these samplers have been demonstrated to vary (CV) only 11.6% from [Federal Reference Methods](https://publiclab.org/wiki/pm-monitoring-regulations#The+Federal+Reference+Methods:), when measuring course particulates (PM10-2.5), making this the most precise published passive particle monitor design [7].  Public Lab is evaluating the deployment of this technology.

## Background

Developed originally for indoor dust monitoring at the University of North Carolina by Jeff Wagner and David Leith, this tiny monitor (in the middle of the housing, below) consists of a fine mesh cap over top of a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) pin stub, a small aluminum object that looks like a pin.  Thomas Peters and Darrin Ott at the University of Iowa added a wind-and-rain housing so the monitors can be used outside.  They also added a glass microscope slide cover on top of the stub, allowing lower-cost analysis with a standard visible-light microscope.

Early testing by Wagner, et al. demonstrated that there was a high correlation between results from the passive sampler and impactor sampling in indoor environments [2, 4]. The wind tunnel used is described in [4].  Windy environments would require wind speed measurements to correct against.

### Enclosures for outdoor operation

Thomas Peters and his team were interested in using passive monitors for outdoor testing that would obviate the need for wind speed data. They developed a housing [[6]](//www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02786820802054236) and rigorously tested it in relation to optical and filter-based dichotomous samplers in wind tunnels and field tests [6, 7, 8].  The friction between the two plates slows air down and normalizes the deposition of particles.

Wagner adapted a version of this flat plate system [10]:
