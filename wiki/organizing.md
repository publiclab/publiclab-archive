Public Lab respectfully draws on multiple rich lineages of organizing with a site-specific focus for community self-determination. 

>_We lift up indigenous movements for land defense, poor people's struggles for land reform / tenure, the lived expertise of HIV patients that changed medical research, and Public Lab's own predecessor organization Grassroots Mapping as ancestors in this work. We lift up the methods and ethics of Freirian organizing, action research, participatory planning, and public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) as we develop methods and ethics._ 

**Public Lab's community science projects are place-based and led by local residents**. This is for several reasons, including: 1) people near the site through time have priceless lived experience; 2) governance is geographic by what environmental regulations are in effect and which electoral district you're a constituent in; and 3) place offers a container for multiple standpoints to offer views on the same place. **Stand for what you stand on!**
