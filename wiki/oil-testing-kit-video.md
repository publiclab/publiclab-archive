###Desk video request

Mathew and I are working on a new video for a Kickstarter, and need some help portraying the resourcefulness (and eccentricity) of the PL mailing lists. The video is in the style of a Wes Anderson movie! Time to get out the tweed.

We need some video of people participating on the mailing lists, solving an "enviro tech" problem (or mystery!) collaboratively. We need video of people:

* walking up to their computer and sitting down
* typing furiously with an intense "problem solving" look on their face
* stroking their chins
* being "retro stylish"
* all this on a decent camera please... the video is in HD so far (see example videos for reference)

Please upload your videos to YouTube and post the links here, or send them to Jeff! We aren't sure how many we'll be using, but getting them right may take a take or two, so if you are willing, we may ask you to tweak a couple things and re-shoot... thanks in advance to anyone who's able and willing to help!

This will be in the style of a Wes Anderson movie. Tips for building your "Wes Anderson world":

* extreme symmetry (see below videos)
* paisley shirts
* sweaters
* tweed
* pastel-colored rooms
* desks with chotchkes and interesting crap on them, carefully arranged (see below photos)
* ponchos and or ridiculous weather gear
* radios in the background
