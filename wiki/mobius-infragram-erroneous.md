HSV example: H: `.5-(R-B/B+R)/2`, S: 1, V: 1

In the above example, the .5 value is the additive, and the multiplicative is the "/2", which doesn't change. I only varied the additive by 0.1, which just shifts the scale around the color wheel. 

Here are the processed images, again with webcam first, Mobius second:

`H:0.5-(R-B/B+R)/2` for both:

For the record, just storing the **incorrectly done** NDVI alternative originally posted on this note, which have since been corrected: http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/04-10-2014/mobius-action-cam-infragram-tests

Remember: these are WRONG! They essentially only show the red channel; due to order of operations, blue is cancelled out. Boo.

`H:0.4-(R-B/B+R)/2` for both:

`H:0.5-(R-B/B+R)/2` for the webcam, `H:0.4-(R-B/B+R)/2` for the Mobius:
