Many people don’t know about problems like coastal land loss. With big rivers like the Mississippi  and millions of growing wetlands we need loads of sediment to sustain our coast. I asked myself, “What is coastal land loss anyway”? Coastal land loss is when our coats start to erode away due to physical factors such as reduced sediment flow, human activities, frequent storms, and relative sea level rise. However the three major causes of coastal erosion are reduced sediment flow, subsidence, and sea level rise. 

For starters, the natural process of coastal land formation in Louisiana is based on the sedimentary load delivered by the Mississippi River.  Reduced sediment flow from the Mississippi River and its tributaries is largely responsible for wetland loss. Before humans settled in the region, sediment flow created enough land in southeastern Louisiana to more than compensate for natural sea-level rise sinking land and the occasional storm. When humans settled in the area, they began managing the Mississippi River by building levees along the river’s borders to prevent river flooding. 

Different from coastal flooding, river flooding occurs when rivers overflow after excessive rain or snowmelt. Second, Subsidence is believed to be a natural process, which has likely been occurring in the region for thousands of years. But scientists believe the process has been enhanced by a variety of human activities in the Mississippi Delta over the past century, including oil and gas extraction, as well as the building of levees and other actions affecting the flow of the Mississippi River, which carries mud and sediment down toward the Gulf and helped build up the delta in the first place.

Last but not least,  What causes land loss in Louisiana is sea level rise.  Sea levels rise in three major forms. One as we consume the water from underground the land sinks down to where that water once was. Second, wetlands are becoming drier causing the soil to dry out and sink because it loses its density. Lastly, we are building on top of land which pushes the land lower and all of these cause the sea level to rise more. When we make jokes about New Orleans or Louisiana being underwater it just might actually be true.


### Location

New Orleans

### Goals and Motivations
  It's a joke here in New Orleans to talk about how we might be underwater in years to come. However, we take this matter very seriously and want to make change to change how our land is being eroded away. We care about our city and we want to see it it centuries from now.

### What are we working on now:

We're building a table top model and capturing images of it to illustrate the ways in which the world experiences land loss.
