Dear Friends, 

En route to change the laws of the air at European Ministers and Commissioners biannual Meeting on the future of European transportation in Ljubljana, Slovenia next week, Aerocene Community are planning a human flight performance with the potential of a new world record for a fully solar manned flight, mobilizing the Aerocene community of hackers, balloonists, dreamers, artists and scientists to collectively achieve buoyancy using only the Sun as a resource. 

Please join us in the follow up of Aerocene in White Sands, New Mexico in 2015, where seven passengers were buoyant with the air for approx. 2 hours and 15 minutes without using ANY propane, thereby establishing new worldwide records and discerning itself from all other certified solar crafts in existence. 

We will be there to set up the flight every morning April 24 and April 25 from 6am in Tivoli Park, and hope to be able to rise around 9-10am in the morning. Come join us, becoming airborne through the power of the Sun, wind currents and atmospheric laws. 

Please contact:

> Camilla 0049(0)17622081857 or 

> Erik 00(0)15224129516 

for more information closer to the date. 

And as always: the flight is weather dependent!!

Fair winds,
