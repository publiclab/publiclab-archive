Many people ask what the main results or outcomes of Grassroots Mapping and other Public Laboratory projects are. 

While each project has different emphases, some of the outcomes we push for include:

###Media/journalism###

Throughout the [mapping of the BP oil spill](/place/new-orleans), our imagery and data has been used by journalists and others documenting the oil's effects. From the [New York Times](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/hacking-the-gulf-oil-spill-with-kites-and-cameras/) to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill#Spill_area_and_thickness), our images have served to depict the disaster in greater depth and detail than many traditional sources. We have also supported local news in reporting on nearby environmental crises, such as the [Brooklyn Eagle's reporting](http://www.brooklyneagle.com/categories/category.php?category_id=27&id=40985) on the [Gowanus Canal cleanup monitoring](/place/new-york-city).

###Community building###

Sometimes, running around with a balloon outdoors can serve to bring people out of their homes, help neighbors meet and engage in discussion and action over common environmental concerns.
