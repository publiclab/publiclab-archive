The Public Lab non-profit hosts the **Oil and Gas Accountability Toolkit**, a collection of resources and a coalition of people working around the world on oil and gas issues. 

This toolkit goes beyond just "tools" to include:

* peer support networks
* [stories](/blog) of change and of challenges
* ways to [build a community of practice](/facilitation) for sustained collaboration on a problem

To see a full list of monitoring methods related to oil and gas, [click here](https://publiclab.org/methods#oil-and-gas). 

### Coalitions

What follows are a range of different topic-specific coalitions we've helped to bring together around a range of oil and gas related issues. We’ve learned more than ever to rely on the creativity and diverse skill-sets of contributors to develop new and unexpected ways of achieving goals. 

The thousands of people around the world who make up the Public Lab network **bring incredible expertise and a willingness to plug in and tackle problems** and continue to inspire us in their power and capacity. It’s our continuing responsibility to help them recognize and form alliances, and to solve problems together. 

### Frac sand mining

These resources are built around work supported by the [11th Hour Project](https://11thhourproject.org) which [focused on the issue of frac sand mining](/frac-sand). Since then, a range of projects have evolved to address different aspects of the issue.

## Air Monitoring

### Microscope 

The Basic Microscope project on Public Lab was born from people’s interest in being able to visualize particulate matter that is known to be harmful for human and livestock health. Several local community members recognized the challenges in advocating with purely numerical data; when people can’t visualize and directly see threats, it can be easier to ignore.

### Air sampling

Building on work by the Bucket Brigade, we've documented and collected several different techniques for collecting air samples for processing at a lab.

### Measuring particles

There are many different ways to measure particulate pollution. Read below to find out more.

### Visual emission monitoring

Using your eyes or a camera to monitor emissions is a powerful type of monitoring which has several EPA methods associated with it.

## Water Monitoring 

A wide range of sample-based, electronic, and other methods of monitoring water quality have been compiled on Public Lab, reflecting a range of efforts across our community.

### Photo documentation

Public Lab work began with photographic monitoring using [balloons and kites](/balloon-mapping). We've grown our coalition around a number of other ways that powerful visual evidence can be produced through photography.

### Turbidity

A range of techniques has been compiled around turbidity monitoring:

### Datalogging

A surprisingly broad coalition of projects has developed around Public Lab for logging data from different sources. See the main [Data Logging page](/data-logging) for more.

## Soil Monitoring

We're developing initial soil sampling and monitoring techniques and resources under the "soil testing" topic:
