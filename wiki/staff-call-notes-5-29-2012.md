###Sara###
* Goals
* Publications: Draft 4S paper, H2S abstract; materials for France in Dropbox
* Outreach: continue PLOTS providence development: mailing list, follow up workshop, interest in NIR workshop, update on workshop--3 hours not really enough time--better to do two one making, one imaging
* Fundraising: Finish Claneil LOI-Budget help?, draft Cedar Tree toxics version
* Research: H2S next steps--bags made/send strips?, Thermal Flashlight next steps--annotate the code so none-programmers can understand how it work/thermal image archive (glowdoodle?), get designs from workshop into Public Lab -- organizers list, tool dev timeline, how to lead workshops? Creating connection-with website at the sametime

###Meetings###
###Miscellaneous###
* near-infrared - connect Sara’s folks with FarmHack folks directly and via website

* workshop leading suggestion: have working thermal flashlights so a workshop can break up into imaging and construction groups
  * another: maybe separate brainstorm/pushing envelope vs. just building in well-established way
  * another: have a “designated documenter” (DD) and use that moment to intro the CERN OHL and capture the excitement of participants into long-term engagement. 

* Meta: tackle workshop teaching techniques as part of:  http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/tool-development-timeline 
  * create a “Workshop brainstorm” page? 
  * first step: pose clear questions/challenges you’ve faced and solicit input
