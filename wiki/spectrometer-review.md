Questions for Spectrometer

Staff notes:

* can we ever get accurate spectrometry/ is calibration truly possible? Is non-expert use, producing high-quality data truly possible, or is this a learning tool only?
* I think this tool could definitely benefit from a proof of concept--can we identify an unknown materials by reference to spectra available in the archive
* Very speculative.... need not to make too many claims.  Long-term issues with calibration, brings in experts over technical interest

Barriers: Sample Prep

* long term goal to create hobbyist engagement and develop lab-grade tool.  investigation of spectrometry supports other tools like hyperspectral scanning

Goal for month: document hyperspectral scanning--Hello World--draw more contributors into project
Proposed goal for three months: archive of spectra?
Proposed goal for six months: Identify plant species
Proposed over all goal for year: identify oil contamination water or soil

###History/context of tool###

* what inspired it? Use of Spectrometry for chemical analysis in lab
* who (all) designed/developed/tested it? Where? Jeff/Boston
* where has it been used and how did it go? Boston, NYC Whitney Workshop, some independent developers have purchased kits
* how specialized is demand for the tool? broadly applicable or very site/condition specific? Could be broadly used: water analysis-gowanus, air analysis, gas patch

###Replicability###

* documentation, transmission to new users
  * no clearly documented use cases, speculation but no specifics on how to achieve naptha/oil profiling, etc.  Needs beginner-level support, step users through a use case, with comparative spectra in the spectrum analysis software.
  * tools needed? video camera, camera, something to make spectra, internet, computer
  * skills needed? - what knowledge does it assume? difficulty? ability to understand spectrometry
  * materials needed - supply chain limitations
  * saftey-no immediate safety concerns

###Development###

* what is it costing us in staff hours? Jeff spends quite a lot of research time on this
* what is it costing in materials? relatively low cost assuming you have computer access
* COTS (consumer-off-the-shelf) effects Tool development driven by low cost/resolution/spectral sensitivity of super cheap video cameras

###Maintinance###

* what are the per-use costs? Unclear
* what are wearing parts? (frequency of replacement) Unclear

###Accessibility/legibility###

* are there opportunities for people to participate/contribute
  * there is space for expert contribution but not much for amateurs.  Needs a demo experiment, 
* formats: online/offline? The spectral work bench and archive are legible and accessible
* cost? (dollars, time)
  * $35, two-three hours, whatever it takes to get spectrometry expertise
* access to materials, components
  * fairly accessible, webcams are almost universal
* language barrier?
  * Jeff did a Peru workshop, but otherwise all english
* language: domain-specific, insider/outsider
  * very insider language. needs examples.

change effected

* how has it measurably/materially affected: Not ready for this stage yet
  * local ecology
  * available/actionable information?
  * decision making
  * legal, policy, regulatory
  * enables participation in a formerly closed information loop

Future:

2012 tool goals:

* can we ever get accurate spectrometry/ is calibration truly possible? Is non-expert use, producing high-quality data truly possible, or is this a learning tool only?
* I think this tool could definitely benefit from a proof of concept--can we identify an unknown materials by reference to spectra available in the archive
* can we integrate with the Aster spectral library on the software side?
* Test site on a smoke stack?
