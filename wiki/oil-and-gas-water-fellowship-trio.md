# Oil and Gas Water Fellowship Trio

This page is designed to pull together the work of the [Oil and Gas Water Fellowship Trio](https://publiclab.org/wiki/fellows) group. 

### Goals and Motivations

In this project, we are aiming to advance real-world outcomes of open science hardware used by people to monitor the environmental impacts of the oil & gas industry.
 
The major goals of this Fellowship are: 

- To research and post documentation on Public Lab on methods used by watershed groups, watchdog groups, states, universities, and individuals to organize and advocate for improvements on water quality issues in areas affected by the oil & gas industry. 
- To connect with individuals who do this type of monitoring, conduct interviews, and document their stories and experiences related to this work on PublicLab.org.
- To create documentation of Public Lab water quality monitoring tools to make the tools more accessible to others. Tools will include Arudino-compatible sensors from the DF Robot collection,
- To develop activities relevant to oil and gas monitoring that can be replicated by others.
- To work on local water quality monitoring projects related to the impacts of the oil & gas industry.
- To document their user experience with current and emerging monitoring tools available at PublicLab.org.


### People who are involved
Three fellows are focusing on the impacts to water quality caused by the oil and gas industry: 
 
- **[Will Macfarlane](https://publiclab.org/profile/wmacfarl)**: [Hardware fellow](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/08-06-2019/seeking-hardware-fellow-for-oil-gas-water-fellowship-trio): Will is working with open science hardware used to monitor the water quality impacts of the oil & gas industry, he's working on documentation and resources for how to use these tools to advance real-world outcomes.
- **[Charlotte Clark](https://publiclab.org/profile/charlotte_clarke#2/29.9/-61.2/)**: [Monitoring Methods Fellow](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/08-06-2019/seeking-monitoring-methods-fellow-for-oil-gas-water-fellowship-trio): Charlotte is researching and documenting methods for organizing and advocating with community-collected data on the water quality impacts of the oil & gas industry.  
- **[Rollin Black](https://publiclab.org/profile/rollinrenola)**: [Community Fellow](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/08-06-2019/seeking-community-fellow-for-oil-gas-water-fellowship-trio): Rollin lives and works in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans, a community with direct oil & gas industry impacts. He is working directly with people on local water quality concerns related to the industry.
