This page was created to collect notes and ideas around the development of a concise guide and overview of useful methods and approaches used in grassroots science.

###Format###
One form this project could take is: the collaborative development of a "field guide" for grassroots scientific research.  This field guide could have an online, wiki-editable version, that periodically was edited down to a compact, printable version.  

###Possible Topics###
Some possible topics / chapters in such a guide might be:

-- PLOTS: History and purpose of the organization
-- Grassroots science: philosophy, methods, resources
-- PLOTS case studies and examples
-- Field Guide for Doing Research with DIY tools 
-- Pedagogy and approach
-- Forming a local PLOTS chapter
-- Using data to make a convincing case to your community, or to a government agency
-- ?

###Contribute###
You can contribute resources and ideas here on how something like this might come together, or use the associated <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cM-xbk8IDyYJpIjQxUR5n9Flv6lL8LlPpaLccO4hxYA/edit">Google Doc</a>.

This will also be a related session topic at the <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/barnraising">PLOTS barn raising in Cocodrie</a> at the beginning of November.

Bring on the brainstorm!
