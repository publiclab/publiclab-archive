What can you do with air quality data once you have it? Whether you’ve collected the data yourself through community air monitoring or obtained it from an open database, there are many ways to communicate the data and make it meaningful. 

On this wiki page, we’re collecting resources on understanding and communicating air quality data. Please add to these resources and help to improve the page by editing this wiki!

### Different kinds of air quality data

Becoming familiar with the kind of air quality data you have can help you on the way to figuring out what you eventually want to do with the data.

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
<b>Here are some questions to consider about the data:</b>
<ul>
<p>
<li>Is the data from a <b>sensor</b>?</li>
<ul>
<li>Is the data from a stationary sensor 📍 or a portable one 🚶🏽🚴🏽 that was used at different locations?</li>
<li>Is the data collected continuously over time ⏳ 🔁 or only at certain times and dates 🕑 📆 (intermittently)?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<li>Is the data for a <b>general outdoor area</b> 🏙️ (ambient air) or a <b>specific emission source</b> 🏭 (e.g., fenceline monitoring)?</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Is the data from a <b>lab report</b> ⚗️📄 for an <b>air grab sample</b> taken at a specific place and time?</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Did you <b>collect the data yourself</b> 🙋🏾‍♀️ or is it from an existing <b>database with publicly accessible data</b> 🔓 💻?</li>
<ul>
<li>If it’s from an existing database, is the data from regulatory monitors or another monitor network (e.g., community monitors, low-cost monitor networks)?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<li>Considering the equipment used to collect the data, what are its <b>detection limits</b> and <b>data resolution</b>? (This could look like minimum and maximum levels for measurements ⬇️⬆️, and how small a change ↔️ the equipment can measure) </li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Is your data from <b>indoor</b> air 🏠 or <b>outdoor</b> air ☀️ (ambient)?</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Is the data mostly <b>not numerical (qualitative)</b>?</li>
<ul>     
<li>An odor log or odor report? 👃🏽</li>
<li>An oral history? 💬</li>
<li>A visual observation? 👀 (e.g., soot, colored dust, smoke)</li> 
</ul>

### Units of measurement

Looking closely at units in data can help you understand the scale of your measurements and start thinking about how to communicate that scale so it’s meaningful to other people.

### Cleaning and organizing air quality data

Putting your air quality data into an organized table gets it ready for making charts, graphs, and other visualizations. Below are some resources on making tables of tidy data and on "cleaning data."  

<br>

<img style="width: 70%; height: 70%" src="https://publiclab.org/i/45058?s=o" alt="Stylized text providing an overview of Tidy Data. The top reads “Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. - Hadley Wickham.” On the left reads “In tidy data: each variable forms a column; each observation forms a row; each cell is a single measurement.” There is an example table on the lower right with columns ‘id’, ‘name’ and ‘color’ with observations for different cats, illustrating tidy data structure.">

### Graphs, maps, and more ways to present air quality data

Data visualizations like graphs, charts, and maps are a common way to bring numbers to life. And there are also other approaches! Art, zines, non-visual media, and other interactive media can also help you tell a story with your air quality data. We’re collecting resources and examples here of different ways to present air quality data.

_Please [edit this page](https://publiclab.org/wiki/edit/air-quality-data) to add more examples and improve this wiki!_

<br>

<img style="width: 70%; height: 70%" src="https://publiclab.org/i/45138?s=o" alt="Infographic on what visualizations to choose. Examples are comparing values over time with bar graphs, line graphs, or scatter plots; comparing composition with a dual-axis graph, stacked row graph, or line graph; showing a relationship with a bubble chart, scatter plot, or line graph; showing density or distribution in an area with a map.">

+ **[Data Viz Project](https://datavizproject.com/)**: this resource isn’t specific to environmental data, but it’s a neat tool that enables you to choose a data visualization by function (e.g., trend over time, comparison) or raw data input type.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<b>Making visualizations to see trends and potential problems in the data</b>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Even before deciding on how to communicate your air quality data more broadly, it can be helpful to make rough graphs or charts just to see what’s going on with your data. 
</p> 
<p>
Graphing tools built right into spreadsheet programs (like Google Sheets, Excel, or LibreOffice) are often good enough for making these initial data visualizations. Besides looking for patterns, you can also look for clues that there might be problems with the data: measurements that look out of place (outliers), measurements steadily increasing or decreasing unexpectedly, and gaps in data.

### Sharing and taking action with air quality data

* **Real-Time Online Charts and Maps**: Great to visualize trends over time and compare air quality to other regions. This can also allow for more data aggregation and analysis.
* **Data Download**: Publicly accessible data available in easy-to-use formats, either as a direct download or via a request form. This is particularly helpful in addition to web-based charts.
* **Notifications**: Automated text, email, or phone call alerts when environmental conditions exceed a certain threshold. In locations with [limited cell service or wifi](https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/10-29-2021/what-are-ways-to-alert-residents-to-air-quality-concerns-without-using-cell-phones-or-wifi), an Air Quality Flag program can be an option.
* **Partnerships**: Work with local schools, existing government sites, news stations, and other media outlets to reach a broader audience and inform the public about air quality issues.

## Next step challenges

+ Document examples and stories of community scientists presenting air quality data and enacting change on a local issue
+ Test more data visualization tools and collaboratively grow the [table comparing tools here](https://publiclab.org/notes/fongvania/11-15-2021/comparing-data-visualization-tools). And possibly add another table with tools for other kinds of data communications (e.g., nonvisual, using physical media, other creative means!)
+ Create a choose-your-data-viz catalog, similar to the [Data Viz Project](https://datavizproject.com/), but open source and for environmental data
