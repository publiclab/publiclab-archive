We're looking for maps to publish in the open data [PLOTS Archive](/archive). To get your data published, please follow the instructions below. (This page generally replaces [the previous version](/wiki/open-sourcing-mapknitter-data))

###Why: About the Public Lab Archive 

The Archive is a collection of open data maps produced by grassroots mappers, and is like an inverse Data.gov -- open grassroots data rather than open government data. To better fulfill our goal of producing new open-source data sets, the Archive serves as the repository of those sets online, and as a starting point for the discourse we hope they will spark.

###Licensing###

Your map must be licensed with an open source license, and we prefer Public Domain maps. Creative Commons Attribution is also OK. Read more on the [Licenses page](/wiki/licenses)

###Beyond the archive: your map's story###

Maps are more than just data - they tell a story. If you can write about the story behind your map (how you made it, why, with whom, and what happened), that would make a great [research note](/note/add), and it can also be added to the archive entry.

##Submissions##

Contact stewart@publiclaboratory.org to submit your map. Here is an example of the basic information associated with a map project. 

###Example Map Name###
