Sometimes the goal is to map a larger extent of a given area due to various situations such as: 

-initial mapping of a new area and producing a base map for lower flights to follow 

-simply preferring to map for larger extent where resolution requirements are not high 

-crisis/emergency response where larger extent or fresh information may outweigh resolution 

-misc small-scale mapping applications such as land-use/landcover mapping
