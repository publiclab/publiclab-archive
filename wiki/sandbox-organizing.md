Public Lab respectfully draws on multiple rich lineages of organizing focused on site-specific knowledge production towards community self-determination: 

>_We lift up indigenous movements for land defense, poor people's struggles for land reform and tenure, the lived expertise of HIV patients that changed medical research, and the knowledge production undertaken by families affected by cancer clusters as ancestors in this work. We lift up the methods and ethics of Freirian organizing, action research, participatory planning, public participation in geographic information systems (PPGIS), and popular epidemiology as we develop methods and ethics._ 

**Public Lab's community science projects are place-based and led by local residents**. This is for several reasons, including that: 1) people living and working near the site over time possess priceless lived experience; 2) governmental environmental regulation and the likelihood of it being reinforced varies geographically by zoning, administrative boundaries such as polity or electoral district, and specific landform qualities such as type of surface water or viewshed; and that 3) place offers a framework for multiple standpoints to co-locate and test each other for coherence. **Stand for what you stand on!**

# Methods for community organizing

## Organize around place

We recommend this sequence of steps, even if you skip a few, for attracting and organizing a group of people around place-based research. 

### Tour the area

Move through the area together

### Mental mapping

Invite each person to draw a mental map of landmarks, personal situated memories, infrastructure

<br>

### Historical land use mapping

Start investigating what's happened previously on this site as the best way to focus future study designs

+ [How to find out past and current uses for an area of land](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/02-19-2021/how-to-find-out-past-and-current-uses-for-an-area-of-land)

### Aerial mapping

Capture a portrait of the landscape with you and the group in it. Bonus, this is really fun!

<br>

### Annotating aerial maps

Add the points that emerged from touring the site, drawing mental maps, and overlaying the historical maps

This content will likely elicit the next round of questioning, which will provide some direction for your group to:

+  Design future studies. See https://publiclab.org/wiki/study-design.
+ Taking action with your maps: see how you can [use your maps for advocacy](/wiki/advocacy-with-maps)
