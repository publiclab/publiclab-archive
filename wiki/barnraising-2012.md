##Grassroots Mapping Forum##

The [Grassroots Mapping Forum](/forum) will be used as a framework for documenting and continuing conversations started at the barnraising. We'll use Google Docs to take session notes and an interactive wall of sticky notes to plan out the next issue, set for printing in late November/early December.  The planning page is [here](/wiki/forum-planning).

##Logistics##

LUMCON, who are so generous to host us, has an online handbook for visitors. Check it out: http://www.lumcon.edu/facilities/MarineCenter/VisitorHandbook.pdf

###Lodging Options###

The majority of people will be staying at the LUMCON facilities which has male and female dorms. They are $20 per night. If you are not comfortable spending the night in a dorm, the closest marina/lodge is TradeWinds: http://www.tradewindscocodrie.com/. If you are coming with a group of friends, there are also a number of "camp" options (which means large houses with enough sleeping room for 8+).

There are also a number of lodging options in Houma (which is a bit of a distance away) and a couple of options in Chauvin.
