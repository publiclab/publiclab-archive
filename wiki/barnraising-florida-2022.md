##About:
Florida is the stolen ancestral and traditional territories of the Seminole, Miccosukee and Tequesta Native peoples, lands and cultures built by enslaved Black African peoples, and home to immigrant and refugee communities from around the world. 
 
Florida is a prime example of compounding environmental effects that range from [rising temperatures](https://statesatrisk.org/florida/all), [stronger hurricanes and storm systems](https://climatecenter.fsu.edu/topics/hurricanes), [red tide](https://myfwc.com/research/redtide/statewide/), [destruction of coastal and marine environments](https://oceanconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Florida_OC_Report_Master_FINAL_DIGITAL_SMALL.pdf), and [rising level of mosquito populations and mosquito-borne illnesses](https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-borne-diseases/index.html). Historical social inequalities like environmental racism, transphobic legislation, climate displacement, and the ongoing housing crisis [continue to exacerbate the impacts of climate change on exploited and marginalized communities. ](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2020/09/22/climate-change-environmental-justice/)
  
Through the practice of community science, Public Lab’s 2023 Florida Barnraising seeks to contribute to ongoing community efforts by the many and diverse social movements in Florida combating these injustices to protect people and the planet.

Acknowledging the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, health and safety protocols will be in place to ensure participants gather safety during this in-person event. 

Low-income, LGTBQIA2S+, Disabled, Black, Indigenous, People of Color, Asian American Pacific Islander encouraged to apply.
