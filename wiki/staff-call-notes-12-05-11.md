###Collaborations###

* Infrared- what can we get started with this- where can we use a site? Follow-up with RiverLink, Stewart can work on infrared shot during barn raising- Jeff- are infrared maps being made- weekly or bi-weekly round-up for IR camera- post about IR maps in progress, Matt Decker- balloon mapping workshop in New Haven/Yale, some people are waiting for spring to do IR, Liz- flying both- are there new topic areas that we can expand into? 
  * Sara try to organize meeting around IR camera
  * For processing multipectral images, we have two main software projects: 
    * Near-term: Map Knitter to include compositing with R-G-B-nIR. 
    * Long-term: Clashifier - Bobby Sudekum interested in helping with this- Jeff give overview- main software needed to do image processing. From WhereCamp Boston. https://github.com/jywarren/clashifier
  * Recent maps:
    * Asheville https://mapknitter.org/maps/asheville-carrier-park-infrared, https://mapknitter.org/maps/asheville-carrier-park-visible-1
    * Saugus, MA: https://mapknitter.org/maps/saugus-incinerator-ash-landfill-infrared, https://mapknitter.org/maps/saugus-incinerator-landfill
    * Providence:  https://mapknitter.org/maps/savethebay-providence, https://mapknitter.org/maps/savethebay-providence-infrared 

* Email protocol- BCC or cut email address off or if forwarding to list, or just get ahold of them

* UNICEF- next steps- questionnaire that keeps going to Jeff- wants feedback on UNICEF- should submit this, send email to Joe, follow up with Evish (in Rio- ongoing hackathons and aerial mapping in Bahia), reaching out to INSTEDD- make sure we’re connected and remind them about our share-alike provisions. 
  * Is our goal to support Public Lab community in Rio that can engage with our larger community - connect dots -
  * Jeff- reach out to INSTEDD to see who the correct person is to talk with? i have random other contact for Nicolas DiTada: Nditada@instedd.org
  * What are the correct questions to ask the lawyer about how UNICEF has set up this dynamic? 
  * Lawyer- org. scale of UNICEF- underbid on our work to get another organization in
  * Shannon will call Bobbie today about UNICEF issue- being specific about works that are in question- haven’t licensed any balloon mapping technology- can release under OH license- creative works like written materials, photos- cc sharealike- that cite or excerpt portions of original work- matter of spirit of work
  * Is there an argument to be made that UNICEF is not a great partner to groups like us? Making it hard on groups that are doing things that are usable and affordable- shouldn’t crush open source innovators
  * Mikel’s blogpost: http://brainoff.com/weblog/2011/04/16/1660 http://brainoff.com/weblog/2011/04/11/1635
