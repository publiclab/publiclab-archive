**Hero3 NIR Conversion**
_***In Progress !!!***_  

After finding the following video below I attempted to make an infrablue gopro hero3. I found some disassembly images online but this is the only video that I have found of a hero3 lens modification thus far.
I am currently stuck however. I got the lens back together but the part that I took out appears to be more than just an IR filter but part of the lens as well.
Filter-Removal time-lapse. The Filter is removed at 1:30

You will need the following tools to disassemble the Hero 3 
-#4 Torx -00 Screw Driver -Spudger -Pliers and cloth or equivalent for lens opening. 

The original video that I attempted to follow seems suspect at the moment. I am still trying to understand the exact makeup of the OEM hero 3 lens. This is unverified but I found one recent thread on the gopro user forums that claim that the hotmirror which keeps UV an IR away from the sensor comes within the lens.
