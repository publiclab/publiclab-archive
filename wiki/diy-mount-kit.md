The DIY Mount Kit is an experiment in community hardware development. The idea is to offer an evolving basket of goods through the [kits store](http://store.publiclab.org/products/diy-camera-mount-materials-bundle).

The initial set of items included in the kit:


- Flexible PVC tubing
- steel wire
- bamboo chopsticks
- 1-hole #3 rubber stopper
- 9" lengths of birch dowel
- zip ties
- rubber bands
- caribiners
- threaded 1/4-20 nylon stud
- 1/2" 1/4-20 thumbscrew
- thumbtacks
- wooden clothespin
