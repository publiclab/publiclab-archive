###Scholarly Communications and Open Access

Open access research collections provide valuable information for people without access to pricey journals and databases. For Public Lab collaborators active in publishing and scholarly communications, placing work in Open Access journals (when possible) is a great way to ensure that research is available to people who can use it. 

####**Negotiating Author Agreements**

In some cases, institutions will have prepared statements of support or mandates that favor scholarly publishing that you can use to support your case.

[SPARC Author's Rights Addendum](http://www.sparc.arl.org/resources/authors/addendum)
See the SPARC Authors Rights Addendum for an example of how to amend a publishing agreement. 

[Sherpa/RoMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/)
Sherpa/RoMEO provides the copyright status of journals in its database, with color codes to indicate degrees of openess. 

[Beall's List](http://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/)
Not all OA publications are equal. Check here to see a list of publications that have been flagged as (possibly) being predatory.
