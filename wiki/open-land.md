###Scott Kellogg and Staci Pettigrew

In this [class](http://radixcenter.org/workshops/rust/), Scott Kellogg and other sustainability experts give attendees a “toolbox” of techniques and knowledge usable by anyone wanting to create sustainable systems in their own communities.  Using the Radix Ecological Sustainability Center as a living learning laboratory, class participants will engage in an intensive weekend of participatory hands-on activity, seeing firsthand how integrated ecological systems function in an urban context.  Students will come away ready to implement these techniques in a variety of spaces ranging from the micro to the macro!

###Author Leila Darwish

[Earth Repair](http://earthrepair.ca/) is a fertile and diverse compilation of tools, recipes, and stories that has been made possible by the contributions of many inspiring grassroots remediators, healers, community organizers, permaculture designers, and disaster responders who are experimenting with this work in the field!

[3 Month intensive](http://earthrepair.ca/radicalremedies-vancouver/)

###Dr. Elaine Ingham
[Dr. Elaine Ingham](http://www.carbon-negative.us/docs/SoilFoodWeb.pdf) is an energetic, easy-to-understand speaker who explains what life in the soil is all about. Behind this "user-friendly" approach lies a wealth of knowledge gained from years of intensive research into the organisms which make up the soil food web. Elaine not only understands the soil food web, she has knowledge on how to ensure a healthy food web to promote plant growth and reduce reliance on inorganic chemicals.

[20:16] <pdhixenbaugh> how about connecting to hackerspaces? is there a connection between them and gardeners? How about urban farms/gardens on college campuses?
[20:17] <pdhixenbaugh> stevie_, they may be interested in trying/developing open source methods of characterizing their soils :)
[20:17] <pdhixenbaugh> especially around baltimore where I'm from
[20:19] <pdhixenbaugh> I love the connection to water macroinvertebrate monitoring. If you have a microscope, can you do a soil version of seeing what's in your soil?
[20:24] <pdhixenbaugh> Restoration in maryland is the same way -- incentivizes the big projects. HOWEVER, on the commercial side, companies here need good techniques to know if they've cleaned up the soil on their sites as much as they are mandated to. However I don
[20:24] <pdhixenbaugh> don't think those methods are cheap
