Mapping offers a way to share and create knowledge about a place. Making a map to document and describe a local issue is often a helpful first step in community science because it can be done collaboratively, represent all kinds of information—from environmental pollution to cultural resources—and show what people close to the issue already know.  

Maps are a helpful communication tool in community [organizing](https://publiclab.org/wiki/organizing) and [advocacy](https://publiclab.org/wiki/sandbox-advocacy), and you might want to create a map for specific purposes or to communicate with specific people. On this wiki page, we’re collecting some of the different ways that you can take action with maps. 

And while thinking about goals for mapping, we can also understand that the process of mapping and the map created represent much more than a communication tool for a specific purpose. **Making a map builds a connection to a place!** And even with a purpose in mind, a map might start off documenting a location and showing neighbors what’s there, while ending up being used as a tool to communicate with governments and change policies that affect many more people.

## Getting started activities

It can be helpful to start a mapping project by thinking and talking about what you want to make a map of, why you want to map a particular place, and who the map will be for. What new information do you wish to provide with a map? 

The resources and activities below offer some ways to get started with answering these questions before you start gathering equipment and tools for mapping. 

<br>

### Defining advocacy goals

For any community science project, it helps to start with determining your goals. This will help you figure out which smaller steps to take to achieve your goals—in the case of mapping, your goals might influence whether you capture your own aerial images to make a map or use existing maps to build upon.

Below in the section called “Using your maps and aerial images,” you’ll find more information on using maps for specific purposes or audiences.

<br>

### Figuring out where to map

If you can, visit the site or talk to people who live there. If you plan to do balloon or kite mapping, look for potential sites to launch or fly from, and check wind and weather patterns at the site.

### How to choose a mapping tool

**[How to decide on a tool for mapping](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/04-26-2019/how-to-decide-on-a-tool-for-mapping)**: for capturing your own aerial images, this activity includes information on open DIY methods for balloon, kite, and pole mapping, and when each tool works best and their limitations.

If you’d like to use existing maps and digital tools to create maps, rather than capturing your own aerial images, check out the section called "O[ther ways to map](https://publiclab.org/wiki/advocacy-with-maps#Other+ways+to+map)" below.

<hr style="height:3px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

## Tools and methods for DIY mapping

### Aerial photography

The wiki pages and posts listed here are rich resources on **how to capture your own aerial images of a place.** By capturing your own aerial images, you get the most current information on the exact location you’re interested in.

### Other ways to map

+ **[Host a collaborative map drawing workshop](https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/04-05-2017/host-an-event-to-draw-a-picture-of-your-place-as-a-group)**: also called “mental mapping,” this activity describes how a community group can use markers and paper to map what they know.
+ **[A Card Game Approach to Community Mapping](https://publiclab.org/notes/dbsnp/03-17-2019/a-card-game-approach-to-community-mapping)**: this activity by @dbsnp describes a neat way to gather information about a community’s environmental hazards and social risks and map them as a group.

You can also use existing open or publicly available maps if you don’t want or need to capture your own aerial images.

+ **[Green Map System](https://www.greenmap.org/)**: started by @WendyBrawer, Green Maps and its open source mapping tools enable anyone to create a community map embedded with icons, local stories, and information about ecology and culture. Their latest platform, OGM2, is here: https://new.opengreenmap.org/
+ **[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)**: open maps contributed and maintained by a global community. 
+ [Aerial Imagery in the Public Domain](https://publiclab.org/wiki/aerial-imagery-in-the-public-domain)

## Using your maps and aerial images

You might want to use your maps for specific purposes or to communicate with specific people. To help illustrate some of the many ways maps can be used for advocacy, we highlight some of the different ways that maps can be used below.

While thinking about goals for mapping, we can also understand that the process of mapping and the map created represent much more than a communication tool for a single purpose. **Making a map builds a connection to a place**. And even with a purpose in mind, a map might start off documenting a location and showing neighbors what’s there, while ending up being used as a tool to communicate with governments and change policies that affect many more people.

### General information on advocacy and maps

**[Wetlands advocacy wiki](https://publiclab.org/wiki/wetlands-advocacy)**: this wiki is part of the [Wetlands Toolkit](https://publiclab.org/wiki/wetlands-toolkit), but outlines a workshop and general information on some different advocacy goals and the ways that community-collected aerial maps can support those goals.

<br>

### Annotating maps

Putting words, arrows, and drawings on a map can help explain and illuminate what the map shows.
