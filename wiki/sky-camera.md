Sky Camera is a prototype Android app (updated now) for attaching to a balloon or kite for taking pictures at a set interval. It was developed by [Mohit Meena](/profile/mohit) as part of the [2013 Google Summer of Code program with Public Lab](/wiki/gsoc-2013). 


It has the following features:

* Android 2.3.3 is supported now.
* Android 3 is required at minimum.
* custom intervalometer to take pictures every X seconds (from 7 seconds up)
* image stability detection to take pictures only when the camera is not moving too much
* auto-emailing to send low-res versions of the photos to the given email address while in the air, over the cell data connection
* auto-emailing of latitude/longitude
* some camera settings adjustments

The comprehensive User Guide can be found here: (http://publiclab.org/notes/mercyorangi/08-16-2014/sky-cam-user-guide)


Planned features include:

* "beep" pulse on interval to [synchronize with hi-res cameras](/notes/patcoyle/1-30-2013/chdk-usb-remote-shutter-digispark-sketch)
* more compatibility with more phones
* more links to MapKnitter and other Public Lab resources
* low power mode which disables the screen
* more features listed here: https://github.com/publiclab/sky-camera/issues/
