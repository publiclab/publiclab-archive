Pole mapping is fun and easy to do! Perfect for small areas, like urban lots or gardens. You can be very creative about what to use for a pole and how to attach your camera. These people sure were! Materials used include PVC, carbon fiber (a 50' fishing pole), bamboo, and other unknowns!

##How to attach a camera to a pole

Pretty much any way you can! I prefer to use the standard soda bottle rig to protect the camera. You might also employ tape, string, or even a picavet made of bamboo!

If you end up purchasing one of the [Public Lab 11meter carbon fiber poles](http://publiclab.org/notes/Ecta64/03-10-2015/carp-poles-as-viable-imaging-platforms-in-windy-conditions), you can reference [Natalie](/profile/natalie)'s research note on assembling the camera mount [here](http://publiclab.org/notes/Natalie/03-06-2015/diy-pole-mapping-camera-mount).
##Cool pole imagery

Straight-down imagery is great for map-making. Oblique imagery is also cool!
