     - tightened all hex bolts holding plywood frame together 12/2014
     - upgraded firmware to Makerbot v. 7.5
     - broken fan replaced 12/24/2013
     - new nozzles installed 01/04/2014
     - 24v/5v regulator replaced 01/17/2014
     - Removed left nozzle so it could not keep knocking over my prints. 01/20/2014
     - Filament feed mechanism upgraded (all prints were failing) (MakerBot replacement parts for right extruder) 02/06/2014
     - Filament feed mechanism for left extruder printed and installed with MakerBot hardware 04/2014
     - Printed feet, spool holders, and LCD/keypad cover  
     - lubricated noisy fan in motherboard compartment with SuperLube 06/2014
     - Replaced x-axis motor cable (all prints were failing) 08/18/2014
     - x-axis idler pulley is lubricated every week with SuperLube.
     - Installed new ball bearing x-axis idler pulley from Alm Gear ($18). 01/20/2015
     - Tightened all belts. 01/20/2015
     - Tightened all hex bolts holding plywood frame together. They were all loose again after 1000 hours of printing. 01/21/2015
     - Tightened both grub screws on all six pulleys. They all tightened, but I noticed no difference in performance. 01/29/2015
     - Removed the fan from the motherboard compartment. It is not needed for cooling (long story) and just makes noise. 02/11/2015  
     - Replaced failed Alm Gear x-axis idler pulley with new one. Lubricated with silicone lube with PTFE. 3/5/2015
     - Installed [Home Zillions Z arm stiffeners](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Home-Zillions-Platform-Hanger-MakerBot-Replicator-1-1-dual-2-2X-3D-Printer-RED-/271435645223). 3/5/2015
     - Replaced spring in filament feed mechanism ([McMaster Carr part](http://www.mcmaster.com/mv1453494132/#catalog/122/1278/=10t9wft), 	94125K612) 11/20/2015
     - Tightened all hex bolts holding plywood frame together. They were all loose again after another 1000 hours of printing. 12/21/2015
     - Started printing on a glass plate (window glass) held onto the aluminum heated build plate with binder clips. Glass is sprayed with Aquanet Super Extra Hold before each print. By far the best solution i have tried. 12/21/2015
     - Replaced the second Alm Gear x-axis idler pulley (which failed quickly after 1600 hours of use) with the original OEM plastic pulley (Al no longer makes his pulleys). 06/21/2017
    - Tightened all hex bolts holding plywood frame together. They were all loose again after another 1000 hours of printing. 06/25/2017
    - Reformatted all the 2GB SD cards I use because the printer was corrupting them (not sure what the problem was but the SD card reader might be failing).  06/25/2017
    - Replaced the OEM plastic x-axis idler pulley with an aluminum (ball-bearing) pulley from eBay which was too big and required taking the Dremel to the motor mount so the motor was 2mm closer to the idler pulley (the belt length is fixed). 02/20/2018

    - Replaced the MEAN WELL GS220A24-R7B power supply that came with the printer with a MEAN WELL GST220A24-R7B. This seems to be a newer more efficient version. The LEDs in the build chamber had been wavering for a couple of months, and then a few prints failed when the printer suddenly lost power (and the LED on the power supply went out). 11/11/2019
