Mildmay is an area within the Borough of Islington in London, UK. The Mildmay Community Centre (MCC), which is located in Mildmay is "a community regeneration organisation and was established to predominantly but not exclusively be of benefit to the inhabitants of Mildmay in the Borough of Islington in particular to relieve poverty and to develop the capacity and skills of said inhabitants in such a way that they are better able to identify, and help meet, their needs and to participate more fully in society with the object of improving their quality of life" (http://www.mildmaycp.org.uk).
Through the MCC community researchers from all over London will be initiating Extreme Citizen Science + PLOTS initiatives based on the principles of Civic Science (questioning the state of things) and taking the DIY approach, which "emphasises that making technology is something anyone can develop" and extending it to the idea that "scientific research something anyone can do well" (PLOTS).
If you would like to get involved please contact Cindy via email.
