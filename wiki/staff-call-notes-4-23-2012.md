###Miscellaneous###

###Newsletter suggestions###
* Format: **Title in bold** - less than a sentence please - http://link-to-more-info...
* **NYC - EcoHack on Earth Day Weekend** was a smashing, rainy success at Parsons the New School for Design. Collaborating with the Sensemake.rs community (creators of Air Quality Egg) resulted in a sensor pack wirelessly transmitting 6 variables from balloon to ground. Next steps will be to coordinate with data visualizers, test the lenticular balloon case + “tail fin” combo, and mark the line in 20’ increments. 
* **Making two new batches of H2S test strips** - can be sent out to interested community members (San Juan...). Update on cool tent container that can be shipped flat. [Sara to revise this] Check out their Clean Air Act win against fracking http://stuff.com
* Infrared camera assembly/use documentation collaboration starting this week - after shipping of Kickstarter dual camera kits - http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/cfastie/4-15-2012/visibleir-mapping-camera-process 
* **plots-boston list launched** - for coordinating local PLOTS events in the Boston area -
* **PLOTS introduced Balloon Mapping at the San Francisco Exploratorium** this last week.
* **Invitations to PublicLaboratory.org** you can now invite others to PLOTS, if you think they’d be an asset to the community or if they could leverage some of our expertise: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/4-17-2012/inviting-others-join-plots (but of course invites are not **required** to join)
