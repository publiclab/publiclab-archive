###Research questions###

**Is it cement?**

* A 2005 EPA fine was levied against a nearby concrete plant for dumping concrete into the creek... Riverkeeper was involved (link?)

**Is it bacteria?**

Plank Road (58th Road in Maspeth, Queens) is an underutilized street end with known historic and ecological significance on Newtown Creek. With support from the NY-NJ Harbor & Estuary Program and New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission (NEIWPCC) the Newtown Creek Alliance, in partnership with the North Brooklyn Boat Club, is aiming to transform Plank Road to a destination public space providing access as well as ecological/historical information about the area. [Read more about NCA and NBBC's plans for restoration and education](http://www.newtowncreekalliance.org/2013/10/09/this-is-plank-road/).

The earliest set of <a href="http://mapmill.org/images/2011-8-6-brooklyn-newtowncreek">imagery</a> was collected from the Riverkeeper boat during a shoreline infrastructure assessment in Summer 2011. (In progress <a href="https://mapknitter.org/maps/2011-08-06-brooklyn-newtowncreek">map</a>). <a href="http://www.epa.gov/region2/superfund/npl/newtowncreek/">Newtown Creek</a> is another EPA Superfund site within the five boroughs of NYC.
