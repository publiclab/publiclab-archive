### When: Sunday, July 21st -- Monday, July 22nd

### Where:  [Lake Warner, MA](http://goo.gl/maps/n5zto) and  [HackerFarm at Belchertown, MA](http://goo.gl/maps/TdG32)

### RSVP: [waterchestnuts.eventbrite.com ](http://waterchestnuts.eventbrite.com/)

### What:

**Sunday (7/21): Intro to MapKnitter + Infragram**.  We're planning on gathering on **Sunday, July 21st** at the newly-formed "Hacker Farm" in nearby Belchertown, MA in order to do some planning, practice kite and balloon flying, and potluck BBQ-ing.  We'll also be introducing MapKnitter and the Infragram platform, in preparation for the aerial imaging event the next day.

**Monday (7/22): DIY Aerial Water Chestnut Assessment**.  [Water Chestnut](http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/sav/water_chestnut.asp) is an invasive aquatic plant species in Massachusetts that forms dense, floating mats which severely limit available light and nutrients for aquatic ecosystems.   On Monday, July 22nd, we'll be working with members of the [UMass Amherst Dept of Environmental Conservation](http://eco.umass.edu/) and the [US Fish and Wildlife Service](http://www.fws.gov/) to apply Public Lab's DIY aerial imagery techniques in the assessment one or several management sites near Amherst, MA.   Depending on the conditions, we're planning on using [kites](http://publiclab.org/home#kite-mapping) and/or [balloons](http://publiclab.org/home#balloon-mapping) (perhaps based from canoes) to take aerial photos of affected areas both "before" and "after" a management event.  We'll also be capturing [Infragram](http://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram) near-infrared imagery, in order to see whether near-infrared photography can help to distinguish Water Chestnut from other aquatic species.
