* The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (PLOTS) is a community which develops and applies open-source tools to environmental exploration and investigation. By democratizing inexpensive and accessible “Do-It-Yourself” techniques, Public Laboratory creates a collaborative network of practitioners who
actively re-imagine the human relationship with the environment. PLOTS is a nonprofit funded by foundations and the sale of open source tools.

* Video

Suggestion for the video to include the Public Lab as boat with kite metaphor as a awesome hand drawn animation. 

* Navigation Grid with illustrations
