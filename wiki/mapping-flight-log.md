Draft of a 1 page "log entry" form for mappers to take with them to collect site info while balloon mapping. This needs to be formatted into a single page. It is based on the [more comprehensive Logbook project](/wiki/logbook)

###Location information###

* wind speed/direction: 
* latitude (decimal if possible, like: -80.022352):
* longitude: 
* time of day, AM/PM: 
* date: year, month, date: 
* mappers present (first names OK)

###Imagery###

**For each SD card, please note (table):**

* # of images:
* time: 
* rough altitude: 

###Additional notes###
