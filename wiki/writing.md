1. How do different mapping platforms differ epistemologically and practically, from both academic and end-user perspectives?
2. How might or might not these differences impact public participatory mapping activities, and a participatory ethic writ large?
3. What roles should data ownership for marginalized communities take within these platforms? Who benefits from current data ownership policies, and how are these concerns implicated in these mapping platforms?
4. Do these differing approaches to geographic knowledge ownership inform the types of knowledge that should be produced in any of these platforms?
