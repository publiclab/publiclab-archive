# How to use and improve this website

It includes a variety of features that help the Public Lab community collaborate on environmental activism, research, technology design and documentation, and community organizing. 

### Audience & accessibility 
The website's code is organized and structured around [inclusive and welcoming community values](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2#what-makes-this-project-different), as part of our efforts to ensure that historically excluded groups are centered and supported in the crafting of this software project. Designed for a general audience with no particular familiarity with web conventions, priority is given to very low barrier interaction — [low floor and wide walls over high ceiling](http://www.hightechinthehub.com/2011/02/scratching-the-surface-with-mitchel-resnick/).
