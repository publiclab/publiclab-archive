###March 8: (Soil!) Stories from the Underground 
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_o4-RkpPLNU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
In this OpenHour we discussed how to get started with learning and finding resources about soil contamination in our communities. We shared our collective learning moments, some personal stories, and some upcoming events to continue our learning. Are you hoping to meet others on how to take action through community-led science and inquiry? PS: You don't have to have it all figured out just yet! Watch this recording. 

This event might interest you if any of these questions spark your curiosity:

- Are you interested in investigating soil where you live?  
- How did you get interested in soil quality and contamination? 
- What educational resources have you used or have on hand to share with others? 
- What are you still hoping to learn about soil contamination?

Below are additional resources shared by the team at[ Citizen Science Community Resources (CSCR)](https://csresources.org/)  
_Thank you!_

* New York DEC 6 NYCRR part 375 - Deals with environmental remediation programs for hazardous waste sites, specifically the tables at subpart 375-6.8 which deal with the soil cleanup objectives for various land uses (the SCOs are meant to serve as cutoffs for levels of contamination at brownfield or superfund sites that warrant further investigation to be remediated but are a good starting point for understanding what levels of pollutants in your soil are concerning).  https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/remediation_hudson_pdf/part375.pdf

* Cornell University's Waste Management Institute - Part of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, website has excellent resources section including fact sheets concerning soil contamination and testing as well as composting and community waste management.  http://cwmi.css.cornell.edu/resources.htm

* CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) - The toxicological profiles section has information sheets on every soil contaminant you could ever imagine, characterizing the toxicology and adverse health effects information for each toxic substance.  Very detailed and heavy but probably the most accurate reference that is freely accessible online! https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/

* EPA's Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) tables - like the NYS SCOs deals mainly with superfund/brownfield sites but has lots of great information concerning risk assessment for soil contamination and other pollution.  Very technical.  https://www.epa.gov/risk/regional-screening-levels-rsls


###February 8: Undermined: Voices from the Frontlines of Frac Sand Mining 
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pW-L27xWqpI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The perils of fracking are well documented, but the impacts from mining frac sand are less widely known. In this OpenHour, we spoke with the people fighting for clean air and water, fertile farmland, & sustainable livelihoods in fenceline communities from across the midwest. Fracking is an extractive technology that has spread across massive landscapes and unzoned, small towns in the USA as industry has purchased up land rights to conduct operations. Mining for silica sand, use of chemicals, and local water all are pumped into the ground to release small pockets of oil & gas. We heard directly from Wisconsin-based community members who have been bringing their communities together to unite in the struggles for healthy homes and  justice amidst broken promises from frac sand companies. Guest speakers include: Patricia Popple, Dwight Swenson, Ken Schmidt, plus Ted Auch and Shannon Smith from FracTracker Alliance.

### August 3: Understanding Existing Environmental Data
In this OpenHour, we discussed data sources, how people use these resources, and gaps and vulnerabilities in existing data. We can use existing environmental data to examine everything from pollution, weather, maps, and a broad range of environmental factors. There are many data resources from institutions, the government, and independent sources such as Weather Underground. Community groups have used databases such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s TRI (Toxics Release Inventory), and ECHO (Enforcement and Compliance History Online) to hold industries accountable, develop resources around exposure and human health, and advocate when new permits are proposed for industry expansion. Tools such as the EPA’s EJSCREEN can support people to investigate questions focused on pollution exposure and its relation to demographics. These are just a few existing resources.

### June 3: Environmental Education

Environmental education is a process that allows people to explore environmental issues, engage in problem solving, and take action to improve the environment. Through experiential learning, participants develop a deeper understanding of environmental issues and have the skills to make informed and responsible decisions. At Public Lab, we’re working to expand our network of formal and non-formal educators and create a space for collaboration and discussion.

This month, we invite environmental educators to chat about:

 - Developing curricula around field work
 - Building connections between students and local environmental issues
 - Creating space for student-led inquiry
 - using Public Lab tools in an educational setting

### May 6: Launching Summer of Code 

### April 1: Soil Testing

Soil testing through professional labs can be expensive. While there are more affordable options such as XRF and other field test kits, most are still out of community’s price range or aren’t widely available. DIY and open source soil testing methods and technology need further development.

We discuss low cost soil testing, contaminants, and various DIY approaches to analyzing soils.

### March 4:  Diffusion tubes test air quality in the UK  
 
**Presenter:** Louise Francis from www.mappingforchange.org.uk & www.communitymaps.org.uk  

Louise Francis from Mapping for Change will share with us the chemistry of the 70's style analog tubes that communities are installing to document air quality impacts from traffic in London. She will also explain how they are installed, what kind of lab analysis is required after what period of time, and how the results have affected environmental governance -- exciting wins! Here's some background reading about the project: https://povesham.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/28-citizenscience_urbanhealth_book_final.pdf

### February 4: Community Science Disaster Response Toolkit

On Feb 22-24 we will gather in Galveston to work on community-led preparation for environmental disasters: what to do in advance, how to respond as an event unfolds, and what to do to help advocate for cleanup, recovery and remediation in the weeks, months and years after. Whether you can make it to Galveston or not, if you care about these topics, this OpenHour is for You!

Over summer '18, we put together [these principles](https://www.wired.com/story/collection-one-breach-email-accounts-passwords/) for community-led crisis response. Now we're moving towards identifying tools and methods that can be used to gather data about environmental impact: what can your community prepare for? Are there things you should have in your disaster kit now? What kinds of events can we anticipate? For those with previous experiences, what would you make sure do (or do differently) in the future? Here are some question prompts: 

* What are best practices in terms of health and safety in flood and storm events (particularly relating exposure to waterborne contaminants during and after)?
* What kind of real-time data is meaningful to collect? What can wait? 
What are the most important data collection tools to have on hand (cameras, sensors, chemical tests, etc).
* In terms of remediation/recovery, how do you identify areas for further attention/research?
* If you plan to pursue legal / regulatory enforcement with your findings, are there specific guidelines to be aware of when it comes to documentation, chain of custody, data storage, etc?

### January 7:  Lead
[Lead](https://publiclab.org/wiki/lead) is known toxin. There are no safe levels of lead for humans; any amount is a bad amount. Yet lead is a heavy metal that is common in our everyday environment. Historically it has been used in paints, pipes, and in gasoline. In this OpenHour, we will spend time exploring [lead detection and monitoring](https://publiclab.org/notes/read_holman/12-12-2018/list-of-methods-for-lead-detection-monitoring), and the new Lead Data Initiative, a multi-stakeholder effort addressing environmental lead exposure and lead poisoning prevention organized by Public Lab Fellow [Read Holman](https://publiclab.org/profile/read_holman).

## 2018 OpenHours

### December 3: Usability Feedback for PublicLab.org

This fall and winter, we've embarked on a set of projects to improve the [usability and user interface design](/ui) of PublicLab.org. Have you gotten stuck or lost while browsing people's work on Public Lab, or been frustrated or confused trying to find or do things? Then **we need your constructive input** to make improvements. 

Our growing [community of code contributors](https://code.publiclab.org) -- many of whom are making their first contributions to open source -- are looking to improve things, and would love to hear some of your experiences and ideas. We're looking for both general impressions and specific issues -- please show up ready to pitch in and help make Public Lab a better place.

_Background: through projects supported by the DIAL Open Source Center, the Digital Impact Alliance, and the 11th Hour Project, we are looking to make PublicLab.org more accessible and easier to use, with a focus on supporting people looking to engage on environmental issues. We're looking at everything from a smooth log-in sequence to the way our geographic features support regional organizing, to the layout and information design of our topic pages, and more._

### September 10: Using the new Community Microscope
The [Community Microscope](https://publiclab.org/wiki/micro) is shipping! This OpenHour we will spend time working through some of the first steps to get started with the microscope--  from preparing and focusing on your first slides to adjusting your setup for different kinds of viewing.  We'll also explore the ways that images and video of very small things can be used in environmental advocacy, and discuss ways that tools, such as open-source microscopes, can be used to support this work.

### August 6: Summer of Code Projects
As the summer coding season comes to a close, we wanted to take time to look over what has been accomplished, and talk about next steps for coding on Public Lab. First-time and veteran contributors alike, have worked to support summer of code students to bring [exciting new features](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/04-23-2018/announcing-9-google-summer-of-code-projects-for-2018) to PublicLab.org. In just two months, students developed systems allowing people to reply to Public Lab posts by email, to login to Public Lab through google and social media accounts, to explore environmental data and projects on an interactive map and more.

### January 8: Exploratory hydrogen sulfide monitoring methods
Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) is a harmful gas that is released from sources such as oil and gas wells, large animal farms (CAFOs), and in processes such as pulp milling. Monitoring methods include canister sampling, electronic and chemical sensor monitoring, and more. In this OpenHour we discuss two exploratory methods for monitoring H2S, the photographic paper method and the copper tarnishing method.

## 2017 OpenHours

### December 4: [Data Loggers](https://publiclab.org/wiki/data-logging) for Environmental Monitoring
There are a lot of options available now when it comes to choosing a data logger for your environmental sensing project - [The Riffle](https://publiclab.org/wiki/riffle), [the Mayfly](https://envirodiy.org/mayfly/), [Mini Pearl](https://publiclab.org/wiki/mini-pearl-logger), [Nano](https://publiclab.org/wiki/nano-data-logger) and more! How are they different, or similar? How do you know which one to choose for your project? Where are the conversations hosted about these projects? What opportunities for cooperation are there for the loggers now, or in the future?

- From Chris : As a data user, I think one of the things often missed when doing field data acquisition is the need to carefully document the metadata -- in some way that someone else will be able to analyze the data and separate the artifacts from the useful data.  Even for volunteer projects, the effort in getting the data is substantial, and if the metadata is not preserved, that effort may be lost.

### October 2: Collaborations in disaster response between online and on the ground groups

In recent months there has been an incredible surge of extreme disaster events with devastating hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods. The landscape of on-the-ground response and the remote contributions has grown and adapted quickly. There are key organizing moments in between these modes that are delicate. Questions and learning moments have come up quickly about who sets the projects to be tackled, what project designs have been effective, and timing on addressing different aspects of the response. In this OpenHour we discuss these issues and try to identify any patterns or anti-patterns in this type of dynamic disaster response.

### August 7: Problem Identification 

Monday, August 7: Problem Identification (1pm EST, 5pm GMT)

In this OpenHour we explore "problem identification." Articulating questions as a group brings out critical local perspectives on issues, and starts us on a path to figuring out how we might explore these issues, together. In this OpenHour we are joined by individuals who bring deep and varied experiences facilitating group problem identification:

- *Paz Bernaldo:* Paz leads a prototype project called laboratorio el Sombrero in Chile. The project's final goal is to help fight urban inequality and segregation (their physical and digital layers) by experimenting with open technologies and defining/tackling local problems.
- *Dinorah Cantu-Pedraza:* Dino coordinates the GovLab Academy, an online institute aimed at helping government and social innovators take innovative projects from idea to implementation. Under her direction, the Academy has worked with over five hundred innovators from more than 30 countries online and off over the last two years. Thousands more have watched its skill-building videos.
- *Katie Villano Spellman:* Katie is one of the leaders of Arctic and Earth SIGNs, a University of Alaska project to facilitate collaboration in climate change research between youth, scientists, educators, elders and community leaders in Alaskan rural and indigenous communities. Research questions are co-identified across multiple generations, knowledge systems, and spatial scales to address a most pressing local climate change concern.

- Paz Bernaldo: I really like the problem-driven iterative adaptation approach. Although PDIA explicitly aims at reforming state systems, small-scale development projects could I think benefit from following its principles of local solutions for local problems, problem driven positive deviance, learning, iteration, and adaptation ([check all videos here](https://bsc.cid.harvard.edu/video)).

### June 5: Facilitation Techniques and Resources

On the front lines of environmental struggles, pressure is high, collaboration is necessary, and plans and decisions need to be made. Good facilitation techniques in meetings and in strategy development can make all the difference. Among other things, good facilitation can help people to stay on topic, be heard, make decisions, and ensure that everyone has a safe space to contribute. In this OpenHour we talking about facilitation techniques and hearing from individuals who employ different styles of facilitation in their efforts.

### May 1: Art in Environmental Science Advocacy 
Often environmental issues are politically charged, hard to understand, and difficult to approach. Art can be a powerful way to open and share a dialogue about environmental issues. Environmental advocacy art has taken many forms: documentaries, visual pieces, spoken and written word, and performance to name a few. All of these tools help us to engage our brains in new ways, and with new people, about the environmental challenges our communities face. In this OpenHour we were joined by a few people who exercise the intersections of Art and Environmental Science in their work:

- Jason Jones of The Natural History Museum, a mobile and pop-up museum that highlights the socio-political forces that shape nature, and champions bold climate action. Beka and Jason are co-founders of Not An Alternative a collective that works at the intersection of art, activism and critical theory.
- Catherine D'Ignazio: Assistant Professor of Civic Media and Data Visualization at Emerson College. Catherine's work includes [Boston Coastline: Future Past](http://www.kanarinka.com/project/boston-coastline-future-past/) and the [Babbling Brook](http://www.kanarinka.com/project/the-babbling-brook/).
- Matej Vakula is a New York based artist, educator & DIY enthusiast. Co-founder of CLAKULA Art Productions and Founding Director of Open Source Space Administration Institute for Alternative Research, Matej's work explores the impact of culture, technology, location and politics on personal experience, social interrelationships, body, and nature.

### March 6: Water Water Everywhere! A discussion of monitoring strategies and tools

Many would argue that some of the deepest roots of citizen science stems from work in community based water monitoring. In this OpenHour we talked about new water monitoring tools and strategies as well as discussed long standing methods people have used. We were joined by citizen science water monitoring groups, as well as those who have more recently worked on building open source monitoring tools the Riffle and the Mayfly.

* [A tool for study design](http://www.dickinson.edu/download/downloads/id/7016/study_design_manual_2017pdf),  This is a ten step process developed by River Network, where the service provider helps the community partner think through the who, where, what, why, how of their monitoring program. It is crucial that the community partner answer 1-3, then the service provider makes recommendations for the community on steps 4, 5, & 8, finally the service provider and the community partner work through 7, 9, and 10 together. Step 2 & 3 are the most important steps in the study design because it is where the community identifies the question they hope monitoring will answer and how they intend to use the data.
*  Wilson Center and Environmental Law Institute partnered to create a [guide to how to interact with local, state and federal lawmakers - water quality](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/clearing_the_path_eli_report.pdf) was one of the examples and this tiered structure was provided for project design.

### January 9: Classifying Waste

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7H3OrQFHv3o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

There are many different types of waste. Individuals, companies and agencies can  have different methods for classifying waste types and waste streams. This affects the way we view waste and, as a society, handle it. This OpenHour we discuss how waste such as landfill waste, hazardous waste and household waste is classified, and implications of these classifications. 

Here are links we shared during the OpenHour:

## 2016 Open Hours: 

### December 5: Environmental monitoring methods recognized by enforcement bodies

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c6orp8loJmo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

While there are many types of methods people can use in environmental monitoring, only some have been approved by various agencies for official data. The EPA has a specific list of methods that can produce data that deemed sufficient for regulatory grounds [See Federal Reference Method](https://publiclab.org/wiki/pm-monitoring-regulations#The+Federal+Reference+Methods:). 

- What methods are recognized, and by whom? 
- How do methods become recognized or official?
- Can we work to make new methods recognized?

###November 7: New contributors to open source code

Recently, Public Lab has had a number of people who are coding for the first time making substantial contributions! New tools and ideas such as "First Timers Only" github issues have helped to bring new coders in, but we're looking to learn and share more! 

- What helps to makes new code contribution easy? 
- What have First Time Coders contributed to the publiclab.org codebase?
- How can we engage non-coders to help on questions such as design interface? 
- How else can we do outreach for contributors?
- After the first commit, then what? 


###October 3: Such Activities, Very Replication!

<iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQJgyrHWpJ0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Over the past month, Public Lab built out a whole slate of new features for people to engage on the website by creating and replicating activities. Together, these present a brand new way of working collaboratively at Public Lab. 

Whereas before you might have visited a tool page, but wondered how to get involved, now we’re encouraging people to share step-by-step activities for trying out new techniques, testing how well they work, and using them in monitoring. But we're just starting to try this out and we need your input, whether you're new to Public Lab or not!

We’re also happy to welcome organizers Katie Gradowski and Catherine D’Ignazio! Their work as technologists and educators is at the leading edge of the culture of replication and onboarding being cultivated in Public Lab. See their work on the coqui’s “Ladder of Activities” here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/coqui

###September 6: Google Summer of Code Projects

Over the summer, five students from Google Summer of Code have been working hard on projects to bring new features to publiclab.org. These projects include improved profile pages, internationalization of the website, a Question/Answer feature and [more](https://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc-ideas)! Hear from the students and learn about the new features they are helping to bring to Public Lab! 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kiRAVR4NWFw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


###August 1: Public Comment on Environmental Issues

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/JHCWlchG54I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
A Public Comment period is often opened when environmental decisions are being made. Local and federal agencies host Public Comment periods on issues such as environmental impact reports or regulation changes. While anyone can participate in a Public Comment period, how do you know if you're getting your points and interests across? If the issue is something you're passionate about, how to do express your passions in an effective way? Check out this OpenHour on Public Comment!


###July 7: Learning about the Barnraising in Val Verde!

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KRvD5PJNClw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This coming weekend, Public Lab will be hosting a [Regional Barnraising in Val Verde CA](www.publiclab.org/barnraising). In getting ready, we'll be talking with people who have participated in previous Barnraisings, what happened at the event, what the major take aways were, and how things have changed since. We'll also be joined by people who are planning to come to Val Verde for the event. We'll also talk about some of the environmental questions people are interested in exploring and gear up for the event. 

###June 6: Exploring Proof

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNsWjlQVtGQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In this OpenHour we hear from three community researchers and three environmental lawyers on specific case studies with legal applications of community-collected environmental data. Noelle Francois discusses how HeatSeekNYC’s internet-of-things sensor approach to slumlord accountability is faring in NYC’s Municipal Housing Court. Scott Eustis recounts how an oblique kite photo of a conical pile of coal dust met the legal definition of “ongoing pollution” bringing about a $75,000 fine to United Bulk Terminal on the Mississippi River. Jackie Creedon discusses the role of air samples collected with GCMs bucket in what has become the 2nd largest victory ever under the Clean Air Act (Tonawanda Coke). Each of the three lawyers -- Aaron Mango, Chris Nidel, and Edan Rotenberg -- share lessons learned from pursuing environmental cases in both civil and criminal court.   


###May 2: Public Lab's research culture

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CaJka0if_pc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Join us for a discussion on quality, navigability, and onboarding to highlight the following points and more: 

* organizing content
* refereeing content
* standardizing documentation
* collaborating rigorously
* onboarding new researchers

Liz will facilitate this call. We can take notes here: https://pad.publiclab.org/p/research-documentation. 

* We'll start with a round of intros from people who are in the googleHangout or watching / typing in on chat
* We'll choose a notetaker
* We'll go around to give each person time to express a single, concise observation / sticking point they have encountered working in an open, distributed format. Maybe something about where to start, how to continue, find, or bring projects to resolution. 
* ...We may do a second round of short observations! Continue to take notes. 
* Once these experiences are written down, we'll see if there is any clustering. Maybe we have some emerging "problem definitions"
* Now is a good time to add in points of reference on practices that have been working well either in PL or from anywhere to illuminate our discussion. 
* Well-equipped with this context, we can explore some of the current improvements happening to PL's collaborative infrastructure, and also think about more ideas

Here are some background references to where this conversation has been happening, and some resources that have recently been created: 

* call for documentation standards (yagiz, soft, gretchen) https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plots-spectrometry/M9Kiz4WwpKw and also organizing research threads (Stoft, Gretchen)
* draft of research documentation standards (Mathew, Gretchen, Stoft) https://publiclab.org/wiki/research-documentation
* simple ideas for how to structure your research for collaboration through empiricism, specificity, questioning, documenting, citing (Jeff): https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plots-spectrometry/LD2r0nj2RQQ

###November 2: Gearing up for the Barnraising
Coming to the [Barnraising?](/barnraising) 

###Tuesday October 20th, Live Call: Calibration and Characterization of DIY ​Instrumentation

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nqwTxbNic9s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Background**:  ​Those of us who've been interested in building our own ​devices for ​performing environmental measurements have ​struggled with questions like:

- How might we check to see whether we're actually measuring what we hope we're measuring? (E.g. -- is our air quality sensor really working?)
- What sorts of equipment / approaches / methods are 'good enough' to answer (or raise) the questions we're hoping to address?
- What does 'good enough' mean for various audiences (our community; a journalist; a government agency) and purposes (decisions about personal health; triggering an investigation; filing a lawsuit)?

​**Speaker Bio**: Pete Marchetto is a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the​ ​Cornell Soil and Water Lab, and is soon to be an Assistant​ ​Professor in Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering at the​ ​University of Minnesota. His research revolves around finding​ ​new, better, and less expensive ways of making instrumentation​ ​for those in the organismal​ ​and environmental biological fields, as​ ​well as the earth sciences.​ ​More information and contact information can be found at:​ ​http://about.me/pete.marchetto

###Thursday October 8th, Live Call

As a follow-up to the September Open Hour "Transparency in Environmental Policy and Science", we are having a small discussion on transparency in environmental policy and science and its surprising application in the [Secret Science Reform Act of 2015](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/114th-congress/house-report/34/1)

Daniel Sarewitz will be joining us, please read his [piece in Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-will-not-cure-what-ails-science-1.18339) as a preview. Philip Silva, Public Lab organizer, will also be joining us to bring his perspectives on science and politics.

###Monday, October 5: Formaldehyde and the Plant Remediation Experiment

Formaldehyde ["is the most common and most toxicologically understood indoor air pollutant,"](http://publiclab.org/wiki/indoor-air-quality-monitoring) it's just about everywhere. But beyond thinking about it, what if there was something we could _do about it?_ A this OpenHour we'll be talking about Public Lab's new Where We Breathe project and discussing how you can build a plant remediation experiment for about $20 - no soldering or microchips needed! The plants that we are going to be experimenting with have been lab-tested by NASA for cleaning air in [space stations](http://www.wolvertonenvironmental.com/air.htm).

In this call we were joined by : 

* Nick Shapiro Public Lab's Open Air Fellow and  lead researcher on Public Lab's "Where We Breathe" indoor air quality monitoring and mitigation project, and
