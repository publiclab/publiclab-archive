Hi all,

My name is Paul, currently a student at the University of Southern Denmark. I am currently working on a project regarding air pollution and the ways people in large urban areas learn to cope with the problem on a daily basis. We would love to speak with someone who has any useful data or insights on the topic.

Kind Regards,
Paul Nylund
