I am involved in an organization called the Sustainable Oceans Alliance. My mission is to find the nexus between human health and ocean sustainability to find an avenue to persuade people to delve into marine conservation. I would love to use yeast biosensor technology to test the waters in the Potomac River for pathogens, so as to find data to present to congress and state officials to help pass a bill to protect the Potomac. Is this possible?
