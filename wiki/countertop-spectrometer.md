This page documents assembly and use of the Public Lab **Countertop Spectrometer** -- a pre-assembled, pre-calibrated spectrometer with a built-in dimmable light and stage, based on the [Desktop Spectrometry Kit](/wiki/dsk), which was offered as a reward during the [Public Lab DIY Spectrometry Kit Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com/projects/jywarren/public-lab-diy-spectrometry-kit)

Although designs and ideas have evolved since the Countertop Spectrometer was developed, it is still a robust way to measure absorption in liquid samples. 

##Getting started

###Damaged parts

Some of the countertop spectrometers experienced some damage during shipping, and if this happened to you, please contact **retail@publiclaboratory.org** to get replacement parts! Sorry!

###Setup

Although the spectrometer is assembled when shipped, you need to attach the arm to the base (it is detached for shipping) and bolt on the sample stage. 

**Arm:** Plug the arm into the socket at the back of the base (not the light bulb socket!). Be careful not to pinch the USB cable -- you can tuck it into the arm tube or the base, and it will be pushed out of the way. Be careful not to tug on the cable -- you could unplug it from the interior of the spectrometer (it goes to a USB webcam). If this happens, you can keep disassembling the arm until you find where it unplugs and plug it back in. 

**Stage:** The stage is the piece of clear acrylic plastic in your box (it has a brown paper protective cover which you can peel off). Place the stage between the two black plastic clips on the spectrometer's arm. Using a screwdriver and your fingers, insert and tighten the bolts through both clips and the stage's matching holes. 

**Do NOT place the stage too low or the light may melt or burn it if left on high!**

**Bulb & cables:** Screw your light bulb into the socket firmly. Plug in the spectrometer and turn on the dimmer by pressing it down. Plug the USB cable into your computer.

###Retrieving your calibration

If you ordered this in the above-mentioned Kickstarter, your spectrometer was pre-calibrated at the "factory". To retrieve the calibration and begin taking calibrated data, follow these steps: 

* First, register on this site, and log into [SpectralWorkbench.org](https://spectralworkbench.org) with your new username.
* Next, navigate to: https://spectralworkbench.org/lookup/
* Enter your calibration code, which is written on a round sticker on the bottom of your device.

Calibrations can potentially drift over time, but re-calibrating yourself is easy. You'll need a fluorescent light bulb, which you can put into your light socket (turn the dimmer all the way up). Then [follow instructions here](/wiki/spectral-workbench-usage#calibration).

###Construction

Here are some photos of the inside of the spectrometer to show how it's built. Be careful with the wiring!

The wiring layout:

Roughly place the parts and align the holes:

Screw it together:

Finished!

Obviously we skipped some steps - one was cutting holes for all the parts and screwing the light socket around the hole cut in the outlet faceplate. But this shows most of the important bits.
