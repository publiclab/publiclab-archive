Our work in Somerville is developing in partnership with [Parts and Crafts](http://partsandcrafts.org). Somerville is also home to [Sprout](http://thesprouts.org) and the Boston-area Dorkbot chapter.


##Projects##

In Somerville, we've been interested in

* measuring vegetation health using [near-infrared cameras](/tool/near-infrared-camera)
* detecting heat leaks with cheap, DIY [thermal photography](/tool/thermal-photography), allowing for better winterization and heating bill savings
* investigating waste flows, such as where our trash goes -- with Pablo Rey from [Basurama.org](http://basurama.org)
  * check out this map of a [landfill in Saugus, MA](https://mapknitter.org/map/view/saugus-incinerator-landfill) which we made in late 2011
* improving the [DIY spectrometer](/tool/spectrometer) for investigating oil and tar contamination (mainly for use at the [Gowanus Canal](/place/new-york-city) and along the [Gulf Coast](/place/gulf-coast)

We occasionally have meetups at the Pirateship, so get in touch [on the mailing list](/wiki/mailing-lists) if you're interested in participating in or organizing a local meetup.

At Parts & Crafts, we've been doing occasional workshops building [spectrometers](/tool/spectrometer), [infrared cameras](/tool/near-infrared-camera), such as the one used to take this photograph:
