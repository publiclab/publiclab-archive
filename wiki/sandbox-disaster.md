Ahead of the Barnraising, attention was focused on pre/post sampling kits to collect environmental evidence of damage. At the Barnraising, people focused on communications hardware, social organizing methods like “set up a phone tree”, “choose your evacuation center”, as well as food access and health protection. See:  https://publiclab.org/notes/Bronwen/04-04-2019/texas-barnraising-brainstorming-the-emergency-response-toolkit

* Let's make a proposal about what will go "in the box" (not a physical box, apparently)

Other deliverables include social media documentation (LINK from @joyofsoy), an evaluation (in progress by @liz), and a zine in progress by @warren: 

* Zine in progress document: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/03-21-2019/help-make-a-post-texas-barnraising-zine-to-document-the-event . This zine will eventually be sold as a "mini-press book" through store.publiclab.org as well as be downloadable from PublicLab.org, and can serve as the "package" for this so-called Community Science Disaster Response Toolkit. Speaking of names....: 


### Name

Let's choose a name, a wiki page URL, and a tag for this project: 

* disaster
* disaster-response
* crisis-convening
* national-geographic
* nat-geo
* ...

### Timeline

The preliminary report is due on June 1 -- what do we want to have done by then?
