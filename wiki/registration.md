<div class="alert warning">We are in the middle of upgrading to a new Public Lab website! This can cause a little confusion, but bear with us during the transition.</div>

###Instructions

For the time being, to join the Public Lab website, you must first register on the **old** site (PublicLaboratory.org), using the link below. **Then, you must return to this site, PublicLab.org, and log in here!**

Let's go through that step by step:

<div class="well">

<h3>1. Register</h3>

<a target="_blank" class="btn btn-large btn-primary" href="http://publiclaboratory.org/user/register">Register</a>

<h3>2. Come back to this newer, shinier site</h3>

<a class="btn btn-large btn-primary" href="http://publiclab.org/login">Log into this site</a>

</div>

Please email web@publiclaboratory.org if you have questions!
