##Open Meeting##

* sometime in April
* we should meet up a few days before to review - once we find out when the meeting is
* by skype or in person

###The open meeting proposal should include:###

* Your specific geographic site
  * site documentation - photos and some background/historical research

* Your specific social site -- *who* is there and will be affected by your work
  * interview with a local partner from your site, or perhaps an activist involved at that site
  * contact them and invite them to the meeting
  * use this as an opportunity to invite them to collaborate
  * you could propose presenting *with* them, or just invite them to come

* Your data set - or one you propose to take
  * if you have data, that's great! either test data, or from your real site
  * think of this as your "picture or map" of the data -- like the whiteboard exercise, but for real
  * if you don't yet have data, you can present a similar data set you find from someone else -- the EPA, for example
    * you may also present data which you are critical of, and would like to offer an alternative to
    * describe what's wrong with the data and how yours will be better

* Consider actions this might inspire -- what are the outcomes you imagine?
  * how do you want to implement it - print out the images and distribute them?
  * the process itself might be the most important, rather than the final image

##Today's whiteboard exercise##

Finally, by Friday, please write up a "Note" with the photo I took of your proposal.

* 3-500 words?
* next steps: will this be your proposal for the open meeting? What will you do now to prepare?
