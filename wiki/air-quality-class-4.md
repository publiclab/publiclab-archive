<h3><a href="/wiki/air-quality-class">Class Home</a></h3>

<strong>Class Presentation: We are using Google Docs Spreadsheets to store and analyze our data. Spreadsheets are giant tables, with the X-axis labels telling us which data each Y-axis contains. Each row is a different data value at a specific moment in time. </strong>

* Discuss: 
 * What do these numbers mean? what do these units mean? What is a "lot" or a "little", a high or low reading?
 * What are numbers versus trends?

<strong>In Class Activity A:</strong>

* Students form groups and look at data from the example egg
* As other egg data comes online, students search for the egg that was in their house and look at their own data.
* Discuss how the class's eggs compare with each other. 

<strong>In Class Activity B:</strong>

* Hand out a pre-printed google map of the Cypress Hills neighborhood. 
* Students who had an egg in their home will approximately locate their house and put a dot on the map. 

<strong>Class exercise: facilitator demonstrates how to add a location to the COSM feeds for each particular egg, using location data noted on the maps by the students. </strong>

<h3>Over the next week</h3>
<strong>Students create a Research Note with their own observations of: 

* the highest reading of a particular sensor (in units)
* the lowest reading of a particular sensor (in units)
* A guess about the contributing factor to those extreme readings

<strong>Next batch of students take home eggs, set them up and create a Research Note with:</strong>

* Photo of where the egg is installed
* Two photos of what is nearby the egg that might affect air quality
* Writing about any observations they have or challenges they encountered

<strong>Note: as with first egg batch, eggs will remain installed for 2 weeks before students return the equipment and upload data from the Sd card.</strong>
