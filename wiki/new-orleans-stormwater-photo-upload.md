This is a mini-guide to uploading photos for the [New Orleans Stormwater Project](/wiki/stormwater).

You can now upload directly to the shared folder without logging in under a new account -- any Google/Gmail account will work:

1. Upload the photos from Villere site onto your computer in one folder, and the photos from the Earth Lab in a different folder.
2. Click the folder "stormwater photos"
3. Click the Villere folder and select the date range from the past week.
4. Copy the photos from the Villere folder on your home computer into this folder.
5. Once those are uploaded go back to the stormwater folder.
6. Click the Earth Lab folder and select the date range from the past week.
7. Copy the photos from the Earth Lab folder on your home computer into this folder.
8. Once you're finished, pull up the SD card on your computer and erase the photos off of it so it is blank again.
