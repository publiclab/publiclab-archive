This is an information page for the **now-complete rewrite** of the Public Lab website on a new platform, with a whole new look. The new website (which you are using already!) replaced the Drupal-based [PublicLaboratory.org](http://publiclaboratory.org) ([on Github](https://github.com/publiclab/plots) which is now redirected, and the old codebase shut down) with [PublicLab.org](http://publiclab.org).

This project is specifically intended to address many issues with the legacy website, which we'd outgrown in many ways. The new website:

* boasts more usable, friendly, but also more powerful interfaces
* simplifies and refine common tasks like posting research notes and filtering spam
* enables faster development (based on Ruby on Rails and Twitter's Bootstrap frameworks)
* completely revises and streamlines "following" other contributors or specific keywords, with email alerts
* works on tablets, smartphones, and in recent versions of Internet Explorer

The new site uses almost all of the same URL paths as the legacy site -- all old URLs should remain functional.

##Support

The new site will continue to evolve and be refined -- and just like the old site, it may have bugs! Please report these to web@publiclab.org, or enter them here: http://publiclab.org/wiki/issues

##Features

These are now divided into 8 categories which we [tracked on Github](https://github.com/jywarren/plots2/issues/milestones):

* Look and feel
* Finding stuff
* Authoring and editing
* Everyday use
* New and growing users
* Legacy features
* Power users and admins

A smattering of exciting features is listed here; also see the [gallery at the bottom of this page](#gallery)

* new simpler/faster [note posting form](http://publiclab.org/post)
* vastly improved [advanced search](http://publiclab.org/search/ircam)
* fast and easy auto-complete search
* faster, nicer wiki revision interface](http://publiclab.org/wiki/revisions/plots2)
* revamped integrated [subscriptions interface](http://publiclab.org/subscriptions) (you must be logged in)
* events and mailing list info for [place pages](http://publiclab.org/wiki/new-york-city)
* recent notes, wiki pages, and active contributors per topic [in page sidebar](http://publiclab.org/notes/warren/10-1-2012/gowanus-inflow-now-contained-boom)
* easy [tag-based pages](http://publiclab.org/tag/plume)
* "follow" and "star" for each page
* new simplified/improved [wiki editing form](http://publiclab.org/wiki/edit/new-town-creek)
* sorting and prioritization of notes and pages by popularity metric

##Alpha tester group

Many of the more adventuresome and patient of you have joined the "alpha user group" (so named although we've now moved to beta). We ask folks in this group to:

* subscribe to the "plots-alpha" Google Group (below on this page) to be part of ongoing discussion and brainstorming
* respond to occasional requests for input, such as jotting down your thoughts on a new page design or process
* check how specific pages render in specific browsers & devices, and upload screenshots
* try out new interfaces and provide constructive criticism

We try to keep these sorts of requests to once per week or so at a maximum. The benefit of joining the alpha user group is that you'll have a greater say in how the new Public Lab site is designed and implemented -- so if you're opinionated about or dissatisfied with the current site, please join!

Thanks for your patience with the current site and here's looking forward to a newly refreshed PublicLab.org website!

###Migration

These are the needed steps to migrate the entire old site off PublicLaboratory.org and make the new site the default. We are planning to do this at the end of May or start of June 2013.

1. Pull new openid code to publiclab.org
2. Set old.publiclab.org to point to drndl server
3. Batch migrate MapKnitter.org users to new openid auth, test
  * test users who do not have an account on PublicLab.org
  * test users who do have an account on PublicLab.org
  * test completely new users to MapKnitter.org
4. Repeat above tests with SpectralWorkbench.org users
5. Set PublicLab.org openid client to point to old.publiclab.org, confirm that it works, test #3 again
6. Redirect https://publiclab.org/sites/default/files/* to http://old.publiclab.org/sites/default/files/*
7. Point PublicLaboratory.org to PublicLab.org [using nginx redirects](http://motiv-designs.com/articles/setting-301-redirects-nginx)
8. Change Google Analytics codes for PublicLab to point to PublicLaboratory.org stats
9. Hold onto your pants and await load issues and bugs

(time passes)

10. (Someday) copy (rsync) media (images, attachments) to PublicLab.org and close up old site

**This is complete! Hooray!**
