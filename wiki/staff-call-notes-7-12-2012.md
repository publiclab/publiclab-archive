###Questions###
YBCA Occupy Bay Area Curatorial Team asking if artists want to publish a link associated with their exhibit, which link should I use? http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/occupy-maps or http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/balloon-mapping or http://publiclaboratory.org/about
* Safety of urban mapping? near loss of balloon in providence? Wikipage on Safety: start a safety page
* Making Megan a Summer Public Lab Intern in name?
Interns concerns 6 points: where can we find this? one point for us--need to prove that interns are being trained, they have to be getting training similar to academic training, needs to be for the intern not for public laboratory

###Meetings###
* Shannon, lets meet about sponsors soon (stew) Tuesday
* Mat can we reschedule to tomorrow as I need to be over at community environmental college at 1? reschedule to 1 pm EST 10 PST
* H2S call -- NM?
