NDVI image was derived from two color channels in a single photo taken with a camera modified with a special infrared filter.  Note that tree trunks, brown grass, and rocks have very low NDVI values because they are not photosynthetic.  Healthy plants typically have NDVI values between 0.1 and 0.9.

 <p><em>Caption: Normal color photo (left), false color infrared image (NRG), and grayscale and colorized normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images.  Aerial images were taken by a pair of synchronized cameras lofted by a kite and each is stitched from 12-15 images .

 <p><em>Caption: Normal color photo (VIS), false color infrared image (NRG), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images of a yard, pond and adjacent saltmarsh in coastal Louisiana.  Aerial images were taken by a pair of synchronized cameras lofted by a kite and each is stitched from 15-20 images. NRG and NDVI images were derived from two photos, one taken by a normal camera and one taken by a camera modified to record only infrared light. Healthy plants typically have NDVI values between 0.1 and 0.9.  Note that bare soil, dead vegetation, and boardwalks have very low NDVI values because they are not photosynthetic.
