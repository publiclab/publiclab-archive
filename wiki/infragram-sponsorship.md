We've announced three special "sponsorship" reward levels to the [Infragram Kickstarter campaign](http://kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/infragram-the-infrared-photography-project). Read more about these rewards here:

###$350 Infragram Sponsorship with 1 invitation to a “special fundraising event"

Held in Portland (Oregon), NYC, Boston and San Francisco; 20 spots available in each city -- we will announce when they fill up. This event will involve a group aerial (balloon/kite) mapping workshop at a “special” location in each of these cities -- plus an Infragram Point & Shoot for you to take home. Workshops will be held in spring 2014 (once things warm up), exact dates TBA.

###$2500 Infragram Sponsorship with an infrared photography workshop

Want a workshop at your organization or in your community? Backers at this level will receive six Infragram Point & Shoots and a visit from a Public Lab non-profit staff member, who will teach a workshop in using the Infragram at a site of your choosing -- whether it is a community garden, university class, or family farm. To make this possible, we are asking sponsors to cover travel and lodging costs in addition.  Just want to support us, or know someone else who'd love this? Sponsor someone else at this level to gift the reward to them! Workshops will be held in spring 2014 (once things warm up).

###$3500 Infragram Sponsorship with an **aerial** infrared photography workshop

Have a large area -- a farm or park which you'd like to photograph? This sponsorship level reward is the same as above but includes six Infragram Point and Shoots, two balloon or kite mapping kits, and a balloon or kite mapping workshop, to learn to photograph your site from hundreds of feet in the air. To make this possible, we are asking sponsors to cover travel and lodging costs in addition. Workshops will be held in spring 2014 (once things warm up).
