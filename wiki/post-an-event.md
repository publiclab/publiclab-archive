Anyone may host a Public Lab event -- it's a great way to get a local community of Public Labbers together, even just for a meet-and-greet. With **over 8,000 members worldwide**, it's likely that you live near some of them! [Ask on a local discussion list](/lists) if anyone's interested in helping organize it, and feel free to reach out to the [organizers group](/wiki/organizers) for support!

###Posting your event

To post an event, visit http://publiclab.org/post. Use the Templates dropdown menu to choose Post an Event. You will see the headers change in the form:

###Posting your event on a place page

To easily connect an event with a particular place, go to the relevant place page (view all current places here: http://publiclab.org/places) and look in the left sidebar for the "Post an Event" button. When you use this button, your event will be posted and properly tagged. 

_For instance, in the screenshot below, notice the URL at the top and the tags at the bottom containing the place name:_

**Advanced:** If you have recently created a new place page and wish to add event listings and a "Post an Event" button to your left sidebar, tag your page with events:theregionname, for example events:gulf-coast. If you have questions, email web@publiclab.org.

###Google calendar for events

We also have a Google calendar viewable on http://publiclab.org/events page. To have your event appear on this calendar, email organizers@publiclab.org.

###How to host an event

Want some advice on hosting an event -- how to reach people, what to provide, how long it should be, etc? We have several event guides in development, notably: 

* [Host a balloon mapping workshop](/wiki/host-balloon-mapping-workshop)
* [Host a spectrometry workshop](/wiki/spectral-challenge-event-model)

###Track your event

If you hold a local event, please use this form to tell the non-profit arm of Public Lab about it! If you submit multiple events and would ever like to get a summary, simply email staff@publiclab.org. Thanks!
