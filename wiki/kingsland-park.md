This is the beginning of a map of Kingsland Park in Nutley, NJ.
We are beginning the first phase of the aerial photography process. This morning we 
setup the balloon and camera. The wind was over 20 miles an hour so we ended up with video of our Panasonic Lumix , the output looked similar to a free falling skydiver in trouble. 
Tomorrow we will try again. 
We have improved the camera capsule idea. we eliminated the capsule and
have the camera tethered to the balloon with a 3 foot tie wrap and large carabiner.

It is very secure and we are smoothing out the sharp edge on the tie-wrap.
We don't want any punctures.
