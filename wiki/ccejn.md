Central California Environmental Justice Network (CCEJN) operates as a network of organizations fighting for social and environmental justice in California's San Joaquin Valley. This vast, rural region is the agricultural heart of the state. However, decades of environmental injustices against low-income minority populations in the  valley have created systematic problems of cumulative pollution impacts, and disadvantaged social characteristics. CCEJN works to utilize community organizing, power-building, research data gathering, and community stories to reverse that trend. With continued struggle we hope to highlight the resiliency of our place and populations, preserve environmental resources, and enhance the cultural activity of this region.
