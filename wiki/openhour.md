OpenHour is an interactive seminar hosted by the Public Lab community, both online and in person. The topics of OpenHour vary from presentations on tools and methods, discussions on environmental issues, to approaches to data-based advocacy. OpenHour is a great way to meet people in the Public Lab community. Bring your research, your ideas, and your questions, and join us for OpenHour!

* OpenHour is held typically on the first Monday of the month. We occasionally shift this schedule to accomodate guest speakers!  
* The time generally alternates between 8 p.m. ET in odd months and 1 p.m. ET in even months. 
* See schedule below for times and topics. 
* The event is hosted on Zoom -- see weblink and call-in numbers in the event info below!
