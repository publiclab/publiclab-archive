**Replicator 1 Dual Parts and Upgrades**

This is a list of suppliers (with links and/or part numbers) for drop in replacements or upgrades for the MakerBot Replicator 1 Dual 3D printer. Most of the parts listed currently **are probably not correct**, but are the closest I could find.   
I am initialing my approval [ --CLF] if I think the part is appropriate for the Rep 1. Feel free to do the same.  
Please add a note if an entry is obviously not appropriate for the Rep 1 Dual.   
If MakerBot is the only source for a part, please note that.  
If some parts require a modification to work with the Rep 1 Dual, please describe the modification.

**Thermocouple** (Are these all for the Replicator 2/2x?)  

From Scott L: "The only thing to know on the thermocouples is if you buy any of the ring lug ones off eBay they generally don't insulate the lug from the thermocouple, they just crimp the lug on, a better solution would be to buy a thermocouple without a lug, like the original to the Rep 1, and then glue on a thermocouple with high temp adhesive.  I experimented and made a few with high temp RTV to glue the thermocouple into the ring terminal and then some heatshrink over it to make it look nice and protect the wire insulation.  It worked but the the quickest and easiest way i have found is just buy the cheap K-Type thermocouples on eBay with the crimped on ring terminal and fold a piece of Kapton tape over the terminal then pierce a hole in the tape for the screw, install it and double check really quick with a multimeter that neither wire of the thermocouple has continuity to the heater block and keep on printing!"  
From Dan N: "On Rep 1s (and Thing-o-Matics), the t/c is wrapped in a layer or two of kapton tape and then loosely bolted to the outside of the heater 
block under the head of a M3 bolt, possibly under a washer.  They were bolted loosely so as to not cause the t/c bead/joint to puncture through the Kapton tape.  Overtime, the t/c's can become looser and looser causing it to read lower and lower owing to the poor thermal contact with the heater block."

**Heater element**  
Specs for Replicator 1 dual: 24V 40-45W cartridge to fit a ¼ inch (6.35 mm) diameter hole.
The diameter of a cartridge will be around 0.247 inches (6.27 mm) with a tolerance of plus or minus .002 inches (0.05 mm).  The approximate wire length needed from control board to mounted cartridge is 51 inches (1.3m). Heater cartridge lead lengths are shorter than that so extension leads will need to be spliced.  Stories abound of 40W 12V heaters being sold as 40w 24V heaters. They must be 40W 24V for the Rep 1.  A 40W 12V cartridge connected to a 24V power supply will attempt to dissipate 160W with catastrophic results.

$20.00+Shipping $12.00

**X-axis idler pulley** (for GT2 belt, inner bore is 4 mm, OEM pulley has 15 teeth but that might not matter). The OEM pulley has teeth to match the teeth on the belt, but a smooth pulley is also okay.

1. Almgear.com seems to be down. Al apparently does not make these anymore.  
2. Amazon has several but the inner bore is 5 or 8 mm, not 4 mm  
3. Standard 624ZZ ball bearings can be used, but spacers are needed on either side, and you have to buy several.

5. Fender washers can be used on either side of the bearing: https://ultimachine.com/content/fender-washer-pack-15
