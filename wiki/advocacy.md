**Advocacy means taking action to effect change in an issue that personally matters to you**. Advocacy makes up a large portion of activity undertaken in community science [projects](/projects). These projects often produce much-needed data about an environmental issue, and that data needs someone to speak for it [1] to different audiences: 

* Your neighbors
* Elected representatives
* The press
* Regulatory agencies
* In court

## Advocacy methods

**Within the five main types of advocacy efforts** (communicating with your neighbors, the press, elected representatives, regulators at government agencies, and through litigation in court), **here are some particular processes that projects may seek to generate or contribute to:**
 
### Connecting with peers

* [Telling your story](https://publiclab.org/notes/joyofsoy/08-07-2020/tips-for-environmental-storytelling)
* Relationship building (see section on audiences, below)
* [Awareness raising](https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/05-18-2021/what-methods-have-you-used-to-raise-initial-public-awareness-of-a-local-issue) & education
* [Community organizing](https://publiclab.org/wiki/organizing)
* Mobilizing with those working on adjacent, interconnected issues

### Increasing your reach

* [Getting media coverage](https://publiclab.org/wiki/creating-a-media-campaign)
* Nonviolent direct action

### Bumping it up a level

* Power mapping to know where to focus your efforts
* Pressuring elected officials to act on an issue
* Making an issue a focus of an upcoming electoral campaign season

### Engaging with environmental governance processes and political realities

* [Providing public input](https://publiclab.org/wiki/public-comment) to established regulatory processes such as permitting for land uses that are continuing, changing, or new.
* [Documenting exceedances](https://publiclab.org/notes/Holden/03-11-2014/estimating-volume-and-weight-of-petroleum-waste-piles-in-southeast-chicago) or violations to trigger agency investigation, administrative action, and/or enforcement action
* Identifying gaps in [regulatory coverage](https://publiclab.org/tag/regulations) and designing new regulations
* Providing political cover to regulators so they can stand up to corrupt political/economic influence (Example: showing proof of valid grounds to sue the government agency for not acting)
* Litigation against government agencies for not meeting legal standards for environmental protection

### Interacting with more powerful corporate neighbors

  * Mediation with industry
  * [Litigation against industry](https://publiclab.org/notes/kgradow1/07-01-2020/remembering-tonawanda)
