Three core staff present

Friday, December 2 2011

<strong>Collaborations</strong>
* Retail Update: kickstarter work, kit materials sourcing--cheaper sources found--can you guys document them?yeah when it settles we will, still hearing back from several sources....
* Sara follow up with Stewart on Occupy Mapping, possible workshops at Stanford, UCDavis.

<strong>Recent & Upcoming events</strong>
* Hydrogen Sulfide film sensor -- new research note. James Safroth (Xclinic) working on a testing set up (test tubes) with digital sensor and film (issue in that it responds to light). Possible large scale media-genic installation. Preparing for Gulf Coast trip with LUMCON in February for proof of concept and academic paper.
* Thermal Camera Hack RISD class Monday 28th--Need to finish documentation
 * thermal flashlight, where the thermal sensor triggers a RBG LED to change for “timelapse painting”. Need to calibrate the range of colors to the range of temperatures, how fine of detail?
 * thermistor - took a thermometer (contact) out of the housing and put it inside a bottle with the sensor. attach this unit with a fishing line into a canal and drag it through surface water and have light changing on unit. can a “fishing” thing be a delivery device like kites, balloons, and roombas?
* Thermal Camera Thursday at NYC Liz house.
