# Screening for soil contamination

_Lead image: Gathered around the Hanby Field Kit for detecting petroleum hydrocarbons._

<hr>

**The soil testing methods listed on this page use different approaches to screen for contaminants**. In general, the data these methods produce are less accurate and precise than certified lab-based methods, but the methods are **more accessible in terms of materials, cost, and logistics**. Many screening methods are available as kits or portable units that can be used quickly in the field.

+ _Tests for_: Organic contaminants (petroleum products, PAHs, PCBs)
+ _Advantages_: Tests can be done quickly in the field; relatively low cost per sample.
+ _Limitations_: Can be difficult to compare color if the sample is dark; other petroleum compounds might interfere with color changes and lead to inaccurate results interpretation. See more in this comment by @jjcreedon.

+ _Tests for_: indicators of fertility (organic matter, carbonates, N-P-K, and pH) and presence of heavy metals (copper and arsenic).

+ _Tests for_: Metals.
+ _Advantages_: Tests are relatively non-destructive and can be done quickly in the field with portable or handheld units; high cost to purchase but options to rent units can lower costs relative to testing via lab analytical techniques.
+ _Limitations_: It might not be sensitive enough to detect metal concentrations that are relatively low but still above regulatory levels for toxicity (from [EPA Method 6200 doc](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/documents/6200.pdf)).

##### Other methods

+ Public Lab community members came up with some ideas for soil testing in response to this question: [What are other ways to assess soil contamination, besides directly measuring contaminant concentrations?](https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/02-05-2021/what-are-other-ways-to-assess-soil-contamination-besides-directly-measuring-contaminant-concentrations)
+ This [spreadsheet lists several soil testing methods and tools](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dPla3jTr2D_FIBexqd_zKLYyyoA0PgTgH40Xy_3MtPY/edit%23gid%3D0&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1616518485209000&usg=AOvVaw2p5iUCeLO-vv7u49SgKoS1), including those for screening purposes.
+ This paper describes a reagent-based field test to screen for lead in soil: Landes F.C., Paltseva A., Sobolewski J.M., Cheng Z., Ellis T.K., Mailloux B.J., and van Geen A. 2019.

### Measuring effects of contaminants (toxicity)

The screening methods listed above indicate relative or real amounts of a contaminant in a soil sample. But the amount of a contaminant in the soil doesn’t always translate into a predictable effect on living things. To learn about the potential for harmful impacts from contaminated soil, some people complement typical soil testing with tests for toxicity or “effect-based” tests.
