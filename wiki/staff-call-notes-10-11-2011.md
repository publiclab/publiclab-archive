Tuesday-Thursday fresh/soph, Wednesday afternoon junior/senior. Thermal Camera? Liz email  NYCResistor and Public Lab to find folks to support Sara to teach thermal camera. Liz send email to introduce Sara to Carlos.
* NYC - Stephen Metts - adjunct GIS faculty at Laguardia Community College, located one block from Newtown Creek - is going to be presenting our work to date to gauge student and departmental interest in beginning a long term project.
* Riverkeeper - are they working with us or can we go ahead and follow up on our own? Liz send message.
* Butte - update on contract - need to have phone calls to discuss methods, tools, activities Shannon sending mail out on Thursday
* Uganda - see below in fundraising

###Recent & Upcoming events###

* Wednesday October 12, MobilityShifts in NYC with Phil Silva, Liz, Mathew 1:30 - 3:30pm.
* Central Booking---people who know maps will flag--sara will send off to central booking
* Nitinâ€™s class at Parsons

###Fundraising###

* what is up with Uganda? See recent email from Chris C. but do not forward. As Mathew articulated, we have individuals who are part of the greater Public Laboratory community - beyond us 7 staff - who might seriously consider this, but the contract would need to include a percentage going back to PLOTS organization. The position is targeting an individual rather than a group at the onset.

Sara is going to contact Leif, to follow up.

###Public Archive/Web###

* upcoming post from Oscar re: OccupyWallStreet
https://mapknitter.org/maps/2011-10-01-newyork-occupywallstreet - did he separate this into two maps?
