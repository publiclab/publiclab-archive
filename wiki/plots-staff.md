##**Additional support:**

[**Sebastian Silva**](http://publiclab.org/profile/icarito) (he/him)<br />
_Systems Administrator_ <br />
Location: Madre de Dios, Peru <br />
Contact: web@publiclab.org <br />

Our sysadmin, Sebastian, learned to program at age five using a turtle (LOGO). Since his teenage years, a self-learning path in informatics was enlightened by being involved in Free Software communities. This gave him a chance to earn a living early on as a Software Developer and Systems Administrator. Featuring insatiable curiosity, and a holistic approach, he received his formation in Psychology at the Catholic University in Chile.

Sebastian first heard about Public Lab in 2010 when they helped a group of indigenous people from the Shipibo tribe to map their settlement in downtown Lima city. Impressed at the time, he was himself leading volunteering efforts around improving free educational software on OLPC laptops in rural Peru. He is co-founder of the SomosAzucar R&D team, whose mission is to bring libre technology to public classrooms in Latin America.

Sebastian enjoys gardening servers and keeping them running smoothly and orderly.  Having worked before in the industry as SysAdmin, since 2012 he has been a core member of the Sugar Labs Infrastructure Team, and has assumed responsibility of Public Lab servers in 2015. Being a Karate instructor, loving husband and father of two homeschooled children, Sebastian also enjoys nature and tranquility.
