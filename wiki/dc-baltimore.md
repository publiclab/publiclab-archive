Hello Northern Virginia, Maryland, and DC!  We are just getting a local Public Lab chapter started here in this area.  

A few of us here are members of GeoDC and active in the local geo and environmental communities.  We are hoping to organize more events with local organizations and interested individuals.  

One project in Summer 2014 that some members of the DC Area Drone user group are organizing will be aerial mapping of the Banshee Reeks Nature Preserve in Leesburg, VA and updating open street map data of the park as well.  

If you have ideas for projects in the area, add them here!
