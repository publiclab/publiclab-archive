###The Public Lab process is###
that local researchers ask and answer their own environmental questions, and use the results to advocate for locally defined social, political, and environmental goals. 

Our model for our model for civic science tools can be summed up as 
<strong>accessible hardware + field work + free software = high quality local data</strong>
 . . . chain of custody . . . transparency . .  etc






###Our process creates good accurate, traceable data.###

###Precision vs. Accuracy###

(use images to help tell this story)
###Calibration###
of tools is crucial to accurate results . . . 

###Aggregation and sharing data improves the results###
