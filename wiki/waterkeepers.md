Waterkeeper Alliance is a worldwide network of environmental organizations founded in 1999, in response to a growing movement of organizations with such names as Riverkeeper, Baykeeper and Soundkeeper. You can [find your nearest group](https://waterkeeper.org/) here. These groups cover issues affecting Waterkeepers with the aim of protecting rivers, lakes, bays, sounds, and other water bodies around the world. 

By December 2019, the network had grown to 350 members in 46 countries, with half the membership outside the U.S.; the alliance had added 200 groups in the last five years.

The original Riverkeeper, organized in 1983, started on the Hudson River in New York, in response to the destructive industrial pollution that was destroying the river sparking a movement.
