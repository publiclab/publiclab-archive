**[LinkData.org ](http://www.riken.jp/en/)mission**
LinkData's mission is to promote open data by providing a simple way for anyone to create Linked Open Data and publish it. LinkData's unique approach is easy to use for both novice and expert. It provides a simple field based template system combined with hosting that differs from any other Converter to RDF . By this we support the "Web for ALL" mission of the inventors of the World Wide Web - the W3C Consortium.

We aim to generate new knowledge with this service by creating a linked repository for web data of any type ranging from human related information to scientific biological data, as well as by bringing diverse data creators and application developers together in collaboration.
LinkData also provides the platform for Open Science and helps people to organize their communities in various fields.

**Open standards**
LinkData provides data as a free service using Linked Open Data (LOD) open standards for RDF document works. LinkData respects both the spirit of Open Information and as well as Intellectual property by implementing the Creative Commons technical infrastructure of copyright licenses and tools for classifying works, and by encouraging good practices for attribution and provenance within user's linked open data. LinkData ascribes to the W3C "elements of openness" .

**Integrated Database Unit, [RIKEN Institute, Japan](http://www.riken.jp/en/)**
LinkData technology is an original development by [the Bioinformatics And Systems Engineering division (BASE), now the Integrated Database Unit](http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/accc/integr_db/) at RIKEN Institute  Advanced Center for Computing and Computation, a division of RIKEN Institute, to promote Open Data Innovation arising from public organizations for science and technology.
