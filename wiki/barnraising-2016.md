#The 2016 Barnraising theme is "Inviting Collaboration"

The 2016 Annual Barnraising was hosted in Cocodrie Louisiana November 11th-13th. Read more about it below.

###About the Barnraising

The Public Lab Annual Barnraising is the closest thing we have to a Public Lab conference -- but with an emphasis on "doing stuff together." It is an unparalleled, high bandwidth event where people from different regions exchange hard-won technical knowledge, tactics, and stories in person. At the Annual Barnraising, participants will:

*  Improve social ties through in-person collaboration,
*  Participate in in-depth exploration of local environmental issues and ongoing community research,
* Advance technical knowledge, and
* Work on projects such as environmental hardware and software prototyping.
