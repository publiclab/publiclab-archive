Several groups (need to list them here) are working on grassroots mapping-related curricula in various sites. This is a page to help share work, combine efforts, and hopefully create a generalized curricula which can be adopted for use in new projects.

### Current Curricular Development Projects ###

* GrassrootsMappingLima implemented a curriculum based on this document: GrassrootsMappingLimaCurriculum
* NuVoWorkshop - a late April 2010 2-week intensive mapping workshop with high school students from around Boston
* Mikel Maron at [MapKibera.org](http://mapkibera.org/wiki/index.php?title=Curriculum) is also organizing curricular efforts.
* The DepartmentOfPlay at MIT's Center for Future Civic Media (Jeff/grassrootsmapping.org is a member) is developing a mapping curriculum as part of its summer 2010 Urban Learning Labs. More soon.

If you are working on a curriculum please feel free to add yourself to this list.

### Materials ###

To hold a workshop/class on balloon mapping, be sure to look over the BalloonMaterialsList for prices and links to online sources. 

### Outline ###

Typically we try to situate the mapping exercises and tool-building in a specific geographic situation; participants may be interested in mapping their own community and/or supporting a community in need -- even a distant community.

A short workshop can be a few hours long, involving building a basic SodaBottleRig or Picavet suspension and attaching to a balloon to do a short BalloonAerialPhotography flight.

A more in-depth workshop can consist of several days or up to two weeks, and can include the following activities, based on participant age and area of interest:

* Discussion of existing maps of target community
* Hand drawing maps
* Exploring the neighborhood, interviewing neighbors
* Flying kites, observing weather patterns for possible balloon flights
* Building a SodaBottleRig or a BalloonAerialPhotography (Picavet) rig
* Hold a design competition for a camera capsule: strength, low weight, low cost, ease of assembly, access to camera controls, protection of camera from impact, stability in wind and turbulence, portability: Materials list for rig: RigCompetition
* Trash bag balloon construction
* Flights!!
* Flight analysis: what worked and didn't
* View captured images, rectify them
* Print map
* Trace map with tracing paper and/or digital tools
* History/future activities: how has the community evolved? how will it evolve in the next 5 years? 10? 50?
