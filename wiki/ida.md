This is a resources collecting page for Hurricane Ida response; we are **not** an emergency service provider, but non-emergency **questions, requests, inquiries, report-ins, offers of help or capacity are welcome**. We are also maintaining a list of [places to donate to](#donate).

## What is this page?

The purpose of this page is to amplify requests emerging from local community organizations, especially those that work with communities that are bearing the burden of the storm more than others, and many of whom primarily coordinate over the phone or through Facebook groups. 

https://anothergulf.com/ida/ is the primary online hub for response efforts 

If there are other efforts with similar aims, we don't want to duplicate or draw capacity away from them. Likewise, if other efforts are aimed at a different group (say, technologists, or professional crisis responders) and take a different approach, we want to do our best to interconnect with them, but also recognize that there may still be a need for this page. 


### Posting Updates: 

We are happy to feature report-ins from folks involved in Ida response on this page -- you can [post them here](/post?tags=ida,ida-response). 

[ida!question:ida](/tag/ida!question:ida)

### Asks and offers 

If there are **specific asks or offers**, what works best is to break those out as concrete questions, such as:

- we need help with X?
- does anyone need X?

That way we can get people connected up, whether they want to pitch in or they have information you need.
