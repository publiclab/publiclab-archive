Attributing research is important, which is why we have a "Contributors" section on all tool and place pages. But you're only added to the list of contributors if you publish a research note tagged with that tool or place! This is to get people not only to *do* civic science, but to share it with others.

To encourage people to contribute formally, this is a quick email you can send them to invite them (friendly-like) to post on the website:

> Hey XXX - I also want to make sure you get credited for your contributions. For now the best way is if you post a research note on the PublicLaboratory.org website and tag it with "**spectrometer**". Then your name will show up on the right sidebar under "contributors" on the tool page:<br /><br />http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/spectrometer<br /><br />If you prefer not to be listed, it's of course optional. I always hope people will add their name to the list of contributors though.<br /><br />Best,
Jeff
