###History
The Public Lab Writing Group (PLWG) was formed at the [2013 Barnraising](http://publiclab.org/wiki/barnraising-2013) as a means of systematically furthering the mission of Public Lab through publication, both internal and external.  

Even before the Writing Group, Public Lab members have been writing for a variety of publications, and most of the published work is collected [on the Media page](http://publiclab.org/media#Publications).
  
###Structure  
The PLWG generates two publications on a monthly basis, one is a blog post for the Public Lab website and the other is an external publication, potentially a blog post for another site, book chapter, reviewed article, etc. A monthly Writing Leader is responsible for choosing a topic for the Public Lab blog post and finding an external publication to write for.  Blog posts are expected to be completed and posted during the month in which they are begun.  The time associated with external publications is dependent upon outside forces and are not expected to be completed within the month.  Writing Leaders are responsible for stewarding the external publication begun during their month from initial writing through to final publication, including liaising with outside reviewers and making sure any requested edits are completed.  
  
###Authorship  
For multi-author papers, the order of authorship will be mutually agreed upon by all authors with the primary author being listed first.  Where appropriate, authorship will be attributed to the Public Lab Writing Group.
