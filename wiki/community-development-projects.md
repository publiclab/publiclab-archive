This is the work plan for the "ComDevAd" program area of the non-profit. Check out the overall timeline of community development in public lab here: https://publiclab.org/wiki/community-development

****
**@Liz**

**"HEDWIG", AKA, _tool page headers and wiki organization working group_**

* create top level pages for research areas with "activity grids"
* re-parent technique/gear pages to those top level pages, especially https://publiclab.org/wiki/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0 and https://publiclab.org/wiki/foldable-spec
* improve /toolkits and add it to drop-down menus
* where github fits in

**Support conduct and moderation working groups:** 

* Add /Conduct to these places: 
  * /signup form (link, checkbox, force readthrough)
  * check with ppl who are already signed up (pop-up?)
  * in the standard footer that's on all websites
  * as a link in the dropdown menu page "Get Involved" (FYI this generally needs updating)
  * make a new section called "Core Values" on the "About Public Lab" page
  * on github repos (as fulltext)
  * on comment / research note forms (like how we ask again about open sourcing)
  * a "how to print & post this at an event" thing, and also as a single slide to put into multi-day event kickoff decks
  * on event invitations, letting people know this Code of Conduct will be in effect

**Evaluation:**

* clean google group exports
* begin plugging numbers into a final report

**General:** 

* spiff up first contact via kits &social media
* figure out what to do with group members not receiving email
* geography on PL -- 
  * update drop down menus
  * gradually remove mentions of chapters
* blog on public commenting, ref 18F's work on https://epa-notice.usa.gov/
* Organizers Summit -- what do we want to do? research culture?
* support NASA partners in Chesapeake Bay
