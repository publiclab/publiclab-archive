Moderator is top person, let’s shoot for 30 min calls?:

Example: “I spent several hours this week working with Chris F trying to help him write documentation/guides. I hope this will support the goal of greater community self-sufficiency, where community members get more involved in writing documentation, and express expertise. It resulted in some great IR camera guide pages.”
Example notes: (in this case, went in newsletter, too) work with active PLOTS members to write wiki documentation/guides to promote this as a practice, expression of expertise
