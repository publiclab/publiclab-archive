### Issues
[The Frac Sand Issue](https://www.publiclab.org/wiki/frac-sand)
Frac Sand is the material that is used in hydrologic fracturing to inject into wells that allows oil and gas to be pumped to the surface. Wisconsin currently holds 75% of the frac sand market in the entire United States ([Conservation Voters](http://conservationvoters.org/issues/frac-sand-mining/)). The practice of mining sand has plagued Wisconsin with many environmental problems! Learn more about [Frac Sand Mining on this post](https://publiclab.org/notes/mathew/10-22-2014/frac-sand-in-10-minutes).
