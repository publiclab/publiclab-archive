###The downloadable version of Spectral Workbench has been retired in favor of the web-based version###

Watch the new intro video on https://spectralworkbench.org, and try it out in Chrome 21+ or Opera (and soon Firefox 17).

The older version is still available below, but you may have to manually "claim" your spectra after uploading.

----

To download the older version of [Spectral Workbench](/wiki/spectral-workbench), visit:

https://github.com/jywarren/spectral-workbench

You'll see something like this; click "**ZIP**" to download the software:

You can also get a copy for Linux in the attached files at the bottom of this page, but it may not work "out of the box". The Mac version, also here, is more stable.

###Installation###

Look in "spectral_workbench" for folders labeled "application.macosx", "application-linux" etc for the platform you have, and double click **spectral_workbench** to start.

Alternatively, you can download [Processing](http://processing.org) and use it to open the **spectral_workbench.pde** file in the __spectral_workbench__ folder.

###Webcam drivers###

Those using the [$8 Creative webcam](http://www.amazon.com/Creative-Labs-Live-Notebook-Webcam/dp/B005HZQQWO/ref=sr_1_90?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1320257537&sr=1-90) may need drivers. 

Mac users can download Macam here: http://webcam-osx.sourceforge.net/

Linux users may try these, but none have been tested yet. Please edit this page if you find a way to run this camera on Linux!
