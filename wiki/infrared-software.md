There are lots of ways to process infrared imagery to analyze plant health. Here are a few:

## Infragram.org

(more coming soon)

****

## Image Sequencer

A pure JavaScript sequential image processing system, inspired by storyboards 

Image Sequencer is different from other image processing systems in that it's non-destructive: instead of modifying the original image, it creates a new image at each step in a sequence. 

See the [Image Sequencer page](/image-sequencer) for more.

* **Demo:** https://publiclab.github.io/image-sequencer/
* **Source code:** https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/

## Photo monitoring plugin

@nedhorning has developed a plugin for ImageJ (aka Fiji, on the Mac) which can do a lot of powerful infrared compositing work, including batch conversion and image alignment. 

****

## Python

For those who use the webcam and have a Python interpreter, there are some image processing codes available at [Python Webcam Codes](/wiki/python-webcam-codes).
