This draft page is attempting to create a workflow for people to identify reportable issues captured in aerial photography of Harvey-affected areas, specifically industrial sites.

## Basic needs for imagery reporting

1. **Collect images** (from various sources) -- do a call for images ([like this for Harvey](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-12-2017/what-are-some-sources-of-new-aerial-imagery-of-harvey-damages))
2. **Make a list of image URLs for each image set** ([now in this activity](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-20-2017/compile-screenshots-and-urls-for-aerial-images-of-harvey-damages-in-a-spreadsheet-for-reporting?_=1506022098))
3. **Sort through each image entry for possible pollution incidents** (using [guidance on image ID](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-12-2017/how-do-i-identify-an-oil-sheen-or-spill-or-slick-in-aerial-photography)) & take notes on each image in a consistent format  ([like this for Harvey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12ZMti2lH4sST6Apzp_DeCQld4z4ioTmm7LdFiF8fK4A/edit#gid=1))
4. **Submit this list to GRN and/or other partner** (for Harvey, GRN is just watching the spreadsheet) OR report directly to various agencies (need instructions on how to report)

See the below resources to begin [turning these into activities](/post?tags=activity:harvey,hurricanes,activity:hurricanes,activity:disaster-response,disaster-response,harvey,image-sorting).

### Potential partners  

  
Let's brainstorm some partners to work on this and future disaster responses with. See the [main harvey page](/wiki/harvey) too for **Groups**.

**Add other possible partners here (you'll need to be logged in)**

# Resources

For the steps outlined above.

### Compile image sources

(largely complete for now, asked as a question)

Gather satellite or aerial images -- before and after may be needed. Also see compiled imagery sources in this question: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-12-2017/what-are-some-sources-of-new-aerial-imagery-of-harvey-damages

* [NOAA Harvey Images](https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/storms/harvey/index.html)
* [TX National Resources Information Center -"before" images](https://tnris.org/data-download/#!/statewide)
* [The Texas General Land Office -"before" images](http://www.glo.texas.gov/land/land-management/gis/aerials/index.html)
* [USGS Earth Explorer Tool-possibly "both" images](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)
* Related: Irma: https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/storms/irma/index.html (see [Irma page](/wiki/irma))

### Examine images for flooding/damages

Check through images for listed locations--in some cases you can see sheen or waste   

Use this [guide on visual oil identification](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-12-2017/how-do-i-identify-an-oil-sheen-or-spill-or-slick-in-aerial-photography) and [this example image of flaring](https://www.flickr.com/photos/healthygulf/36702612840/in/album-72157686333870693/)

* Images may have meta data with GPS aligned with plane location instead of site location
* Flooded or suspicious locations should be compiled in a spreadsheet for report
* Do screen capture of the footage to attach to report  
* Check to see who owns imagery, which may impact who needs to receive report 
* Compare location to list of industrial sites

### Industrial sites in TX

Gather/compile lists of at-risk sites in TX (oil refineries, sewage, nuclear etc.)

* Main source: [Surging Seas: Risk Finder](https://riskfinder.climatecentral.org/) -EPA tool allows coastline reports by state and specific risk (ex. oil refineries)
* [Harvey Ecological Hazards  Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1U6a8CNO_OcT-bcb-UxgsXNYxW7M&shorturl=1&ll=28.89761085741851%2C-95.62893699999995&z=7)
* [Gulf Restoration Network Map of Oil](https://gulfwetlandsmap.carto.com/viz/06bb2c4a-89d2-11e7-8a08-0ee462b5436c/public_map)
* [Sierra Club Map of Toxic Sites Harvey](http://www.sierraclub.org/environmental-justice/hurricane-harvey-toxic-sites)
* [List of Texas Landfills](https://www.tceq.texas.gov/assets/public/permitting/waste/msw/msw-landfills-active.pdf)
* [Texas Commission on Environmental Quality - Data Tool](https://www.tceq.texas.gov/agency/data/lookup-data/environmental-quality-data-records)
* Longer list in responses to this question: https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-12-2017/where-are-people-compiling-lists-of-potential-pollution-sites-following-hurricane-harvey

### Questions

# Uploading screenshots

These are extra steps for the [NOAA Harvey image compiling activity](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-20-2017/compile-screenshots-and-urls-for-aerial-images-of-harvey-damages-in-a-spreadsheet-for-reporting)

### 1\. Take a screenshot

Take a screenshot of any site from the above lists, or any industrial site you can see where flooding may have caused issues. Example:

![screenshot 2](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/715/medium/Screenshot_2017-09-20_at_10.39.02_AM.png)

### 2\. Upload the screenshot

Upload the screenshot to this folder on this public Google Drive:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1HdcMKx0evKN0tPUEhzTG1KVkU](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1HdcMKx0evKN0tPUEhzTG1KVkU)

You can copy a link to that image by right clicking on it or by selecting it and choosing `Get shareable link`:

![screenshot 4](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/718/medium/Screenshot_2017-09-20_at_11.06.10_AM.png)

You can also upload images as a comment on this page.

Remember to save the link to the photo to add to the spreadsheet. If it's a comment, you can click on the time, i.e. `1 minute ago` next to the comment header to get a direct link to that comment, as in this screenshot:

![screenshot 3](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/021/716/large/Screenshot_2017-09-20_at_10.44.49_AM.png)

### Back to the image compiling activity

If you got here from the [NOAA Harvey image compiling activity](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/09-20-2017/compile-screenshots-and-urls-for-aerial-images-of-harvey-damages-in-a-spreadsheet-for-reporting), you can return there and resume at **Step 2**.
