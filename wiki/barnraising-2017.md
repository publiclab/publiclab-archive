People coming to the Barnraising often want to share on deep topics of interest with each other.  Lightning talks have become a way to engage with people's individual projects or topics of expertise that are more about decimating information (rather that requiring a sessions space where we build a collaborative environment of learning). 

**Lightning talks topics at the 2017 Barnraising included:**

- Invasive species in Louisiana by Chase Mathey
- Exploring leaked emails by Gabi Sobliye
- Water Availability & Vulnerability by @gilbert
- How codes of conduct affect email lists by Molly de Blanc ([link to presentation](https://publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/022/363/original/mdb-barnraising2017-f-as-in-freedom.pdf))
- An oil monitoring project on Louisiana Beaches by @a1ahna
