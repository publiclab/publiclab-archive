Formaldehyde is a colorless, flammable gas that can be carcinogenic to humans, and is a common additive to building materials and household products. Formaldehyde is also formed in the environment upon oxidation of a variety of hydrocarbons, including natural gas (methane). Symptoms of exposure to low concentrations of formaldehyde may include headache, nausea, throat and skin irritation, and exacerbated chemical sensitivity.  For a quick summary of formaldehyde exposure basics, please see the [ASTDR’s ToxFAQs for Formaldehyde](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/TF.asp?id=219&tid=39). For much more in-depth information, please see the [ASTDR’s Toxicological Profile for Formaldehyde](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp.asp?id=220&tid=39). 

In Public Lab, we’ve been exploring low-cost methods for monitoring airborne concentrations of formaldehyde and low-cost methods for mitigating exposure to it.
