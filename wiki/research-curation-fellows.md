## About Research Curation Fellowships
 
Research Curation Fellowships enable individuals with experience and interest in an environmental health topic related to air, water, soil/land, or community organizing and advocacy to grow both their personal knowledge, as well as a larger network of collaborators within that topic area on Public Lab’s platforms. Over the 12 months of the Fellowship, Research Curation Fellows will work individually in their research area, and as a cohort among other Research Curation Fellows to share knowledge and best practices across topics.
 
**Major goals of Research Curation Fellowships for each topic area:**

1. Network with scientists, technologists, and/or organizers working in the environmental topic area and invite contributions to Public Lab’s community science resources in this area.
2. Organize quarterly virtual events where contributors and other interested community members can connect on the environmental topic. 
3. Co-organize a once annual, three-month period of focused outreach and content development in their focus topic area with Public Lab’s Research Coordinator, culminating in a half-day event featuring research highlights, community conversations, and demos or live builds of environmental monitoring tools.
