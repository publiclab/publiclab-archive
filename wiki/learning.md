From Etienne Wegner, in _Communities of Practice: Learning, Meaning, and Identity_, p7

>Placing the focus on participation has broad implications for what it takes to understand and support learning.

>* For _individuals_, it means that learning is an issue of engaging in and contributing to the practices of their communities. 
* For _communities_, it means that learning is an issue of refining their practice and ensuring new generations of members.
* For _organizations_, it means that learning is an issue of sustaining the interconnected communities of practice through which an organizations knows what it knows and thus becomes effective and valuable as an organization.
