###Journal of Aesthetics and Protest Press: Grassroots Modernism###

Completed April 1st: http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/proposals-grassroots-modernism

CONTENTS: Please provide us with enough information to be able to grasp what you are aiming at. 

In calling for a Grassroots Modernism, we seek a political and cultural movement towards liberatory and just futures. This future is not the top-down technocratic, homicidal nightmare known as yesterday's modernism. Rather it is a future where our children are crafting their communities, councils and networks, and being. Grassroots Modernism in contradiction explicitly to the current delusions of "impossibility", "aimlessness" and "realism." Grassroots Modernism must be realistic to localized situations and the general human capacity to dream together, and build together… and chill out.

The limitations of current social practices are now clear. Some are just cashed, others are easily normalized within the neo-liberal city. All the while, the earth gets more polluted, our children are educated with crap, and governments tell us we are more and more screwed by some unwitting invisible hand.

Grassroots Modernism doesn't just talk about itself, it is visible in the generative presence of idealistic social formations. It is not art-historical.

To again be modern (here, modern=present in the future), we need to assess how neo-liberal regimes have crushed our capacity to realize our capacities- to articulate new understandings of social wealth, liberated corporeal presences.

We understand how neoliberal ideology from the most cellular level inside our wee bodies on up, has crushed solidarity, denied collective right to a good life, obliterated common interests. Yet as editors, we know that practice within grassroots communities, studios and movements best clarify these notions by demonstrating neoliberalism's creative undoings.

We are looking for critique and reflection on what does and does not work. Now, now that tomorrow is a reality and our ideals are a possibility. That is a good thing, especially when our strategies, tactics, dreams and beauties come into effect.

What we may be looking for:

* projects from or in the context of collaborative or collective practices.
* grounded in specific practices 
* grounded in occupation 
* lessons learned 
* constructive criticality 
* that are of the flesh, for our flesh 
* things that effect the ways we think about our lives 
* that are strategic propositions to the readership on constituting movements. 
* affective movement 
* art with a role in a movement 
* strategic propositions toward constituting movement 
* new or old

Note: This submission call is a provocation as much as it is a request for archival material.

Proposals can be sent to us before you have the capacity to understand what it is you might really be writing, creating or organizing.

###Princeton Conference on Environmental Politics###

Research Frontiers in Comparative and International Environmental Politics

Call for Papers - deadline March 15, 2011

Princeton University, December 2-3, 2011 Sponsored by Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs 

Dear Colleagues, We are organizing a conference on Environmental Politics at the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance, Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University on December 2-3, 2011. The conference aims at connecting research communities across continents, presenting cutting-edge research in environmental politics, and identifying future research directions in comparative and international environmental politics. The steering committee will also identify a subset of selected papers for a special issue in a major political science journal. Editors of key political science journals are likely to attend the conference. 

Agenda and Rationale

We are particularly interested in proposals that study environmental politics from an international or comparative political economy perspective. Traditionally, IR scholars have emphasized the role of international factors (international regimes, trade, FDI, epistemic communities, IGOs and INGOs) while the comparativists have focused on domestic variables (domestic political institutions, partisanship, economic variables, interest group pressures) to explain environmental policy outputs and outcomes. This conference invites leading scholars to systemically examine the roles of domestic and international factors alone or in interaction to develop more nuanced models of environmental politics across space and time. Some of the broad research areas and questions include (but not limited to): 

* Environmental politics in authoritarian states, 
* Effects of political and economic transitions on the natural environment, 
* The role of citizen preferences and civil society on environmental policy choices, 
* The role of international networks --- e.g., trade, FDI, IGO, NGO --- on environmental policy choices,
* The effectiveness of voluntary regulations and new forms of governance on environmental policy outcomes, 
* Agenda setting in domestic and global environmental politics. 

Expenses Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance has generously offered to cover economy class travel and lodging for paper presenters. 

Time Lines

Please email your paper proposal (one page max) to caox@essex.ac.uk. The proposal submission deadline is March 15, 2011. The steering committee will notify authors of selected papers by May 1, 2011. Best regards, Steering Committee Xun Cao, University of Essex (caox@essex.edu) Helen Milner, Princeton University (hmilner@Princeton.EDU) Aseem Prakash, University of Washington, Seattle (aseem@uw.edu) Hugh Ward, University of Essex (hugh@essex.ac.uk)

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects....over a three month period. Since 2005, the program has brought together over 4,500 students and more than more than 4,000 mentors & co-mentors from over 85 countries worldwide, all for the love of code.

Through Google Summer of Code, accepted student applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios and the opportunity for employment in areas related to their academic pursuits. In turn, the participating projects are able to more easily identify and bring in new developers. Best of all, more source code is created and released for the use and benefit of all.

###Ars Electronica - Digital Communities###

* due March, 18 2011
* 5-10k euros

http://new.aec.at/prix/en/kategorien/digital-communities/

The “Digital Communities” category is open to political, social, cultural and artistic projects, initiatives, groups, and scenes from all over the world that are effectively utilizing digital technology to further society and to promote social responsibility. It is open to the initiators and propagators of these communities as well as the developers of the relevant technologies, and is meant to honor those whose work contributes to the establishment and proliferation of digital communities as well as to those efforts that promote better understanding and research.

Projects will also be selected based on both their social and technological engagement, the usage of social software tools, artistic and cultural approaches and the creative implementation of the concept. Special attention will also be paid towards the degree of the visionary and forward looking potential of the projects, their potential for new innovation and the degree to which they have already been realized.

Jurors will place particular emphasis on the reasonableness, appropriateness and openness of the solutions. Digital Communities projects should enable human beings to enjoy the widest possible access to technology, networks, content and the so-called digital commons. The projects singled out for recognition should be able to serve as models to be taken on by others, and should constitute a source of inspiration, encouragement and empowerment.
