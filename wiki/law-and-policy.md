# Law and Policy

How do laws, regulations, policies, and community science affect each other? Community-collected data has the power to prompt local, state, or federal action by alerting government agencies to an issue. Failures and gaps at the regulatory level are often what leads communities to do their own environmental monitoring and advocacy work. At the same time, laws will affect how community scientists can collect their data for maximum potential impact.

Some subjects that you might see included here in the future:

+ How can community-sourced data be used to impact or enforce regulations at the local, tribal, state, or federal level? 
+ What can community members do to improve their chances of having impact through legal channels?
+ How do laws and agencies enable or impair the ability of communities to collect and contribute data?

This page is a place to collect and organize resources on law and policy, and their relationships with community-led science. Visit the [law-and-policy tag page](/tag/law-and-policy) to see the latest community posts about law and policy on Public Lab, and get updates on this topic by following:

## Community-sourced data and legal issues

Each of us has our own way of thinking about and doing community science. The posts linked below describe an approach to community science from the perspective of [@lenagd](https://publiclab.org/profile/lenagd), an attorney with extensive experience in environmental law. Within the posts you’ll find:

**A three-step approach to using community-sourced data in the legal system:**

Step 1. Identifying the problem: [how it should work](https://publiclab.org/notes/lenagd/12-20-2016/citizen-science-investigations-aka-common-legal-issues-when-using-community-sourced-data#PART+ONE:+How+it+Should+Work) + [common legal obstacles](https://publiclab.org/notes/lenagd/01-25-2017/part-2-common-legal-issues-when-using-community-sourced-data#Step+One:+Identifying+the+Problem)<br>
Step 2. Gathering the evidence: [how it should work](https://publiclab.org/notes/lenagd/12-20-2016/citizen-science-investigations-aka-common-legal-issues-when-using-community-sourced-data#Step+2:+Gathering+the+Evidence) + [common legal obstacles](https://publiclab.org/notes/lenagd/01-25-2017/part-2-common-legal-issues-when-using-community-sourced-data#Step+Two:+Gathering+the+Evidence)<br>
Step 3. Turning evidence into action: [how it should work](https://publiclab.org/notes/lenagd/12-20-2016/citizen-science-investigations-aka-common-legal-issues-when-using-community-sourced-data#Step+3:+Turning+Evidence+into+Action) + [common legal obstacles](https://publiclab.org/notes/lenagd/01-25-2017/part-2-common-legal-issues-when-using-community-sourced-data#Step+Three:+Turning+Evidence+Into+Action)

## Regulations within topic areas on Public Lab

Much of the resources and activity on the Public Lab website are organized by [Topic](https://publiclab.org/wiki/topics) areas--for example, air quality, water quality, and land use. On each Topic’s wiki page (see an example linked below), we’re hoping to include background on what laws and regulations exist and where gaps are, plus examples and stories of how community science can interact with the regulatory world. These sections could cover:

**1. Regulations related to the Topic**

+ Federal level regulations (e.g., set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the US)
+ How to find other regulations that may exist at your state level
+ What’s currently hot in the regulatory world

**2. Examples and stories of what community-collected data can do with regulations in this Topic area**

+ Stimulate government investigation
+ Be used directly by agencies in their assessment
+ Be used in lawsuits 

We hope that the stories will demonstrate the power of local community knowledge and expertise and inspire others who are seeking to address an environmental concern.
