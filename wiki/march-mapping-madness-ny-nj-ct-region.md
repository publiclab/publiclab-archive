##Locations and Dates##
<strong>MARCH 31, 11AM - 2PM: Van Alen Institute</strong>
hosted by staff members Zach Postone and Sarah Farwell. 
<strong>RSVP on the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nycgis/events/58232432/">Meetup Page</a></strong>

The Van Alen Institute has graciously offered their 6th Floor space for a short Intro to Balloon Mapping workshop workshop this Saturday. I'm hoping for about 10 people to attend, including members of this group as well as from Public Laboratory's new Kickstarter backers who just received kits in the mail.

Plan to bring a point and shoot camera with continuous shooting mode (or almost any Canon - google for "CHDK"), and a juice bottle with rectangular profile to make into a housing (video here: http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/pet-bottle-rubber-band-rig). If you have a kit already (http://shop.breadpig.com/collections/publiclaboratory/products/balloon-mapping-kit) please bring it.

I'll bring the rest of the stuff, including helium, for which please chip in a $5 - $8 donation. In case it's too windy for balloons, I'll have some kites. Not sure where we will try to fly yet, depends on the weather. This event is safe for well-chaperoned kids -- note: we will be using sharp cutting tools. 

You may also want to bring a laptop for testing out MapKnitter, our browser-based image stitching application, so you can quickly tile out your custom satellite imagery!
