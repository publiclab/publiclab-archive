This is a page showing how to make Gifs of what's on your computer screen -- to help document software issues in [Public Lab software projects](https://code.publiclab.org).

(Sourcing from https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/3513)

## Make a GIF

For interactive features, like hover effects, autocompletion, or progress bars and such, or to demonstrate changing the screen width, you can use different programs to make an animated GIF and upload that into the pull request. That's super helpful, and also fun!  

You can use these programs to make the Gif:
