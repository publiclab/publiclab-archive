<strong>Location 2011-2012:
Providence Rhode Island</strong>

<strong>My own research focus and statement of purpose:
Toxics and Health research:</strong>
Fulling my role as director of toxics I will form a collaborative working group on the issues centered in RISD. I see three overlapping areas of interest for PLOTS toxics and health work: chemicals pollutants-endocrine disruption--homes/industrial areas/water sources, Biological hazards-water borne disease, Air quality-Asthma--gas patch/refinerary communities/homes.  For my personal research would like to focus on endocrine disruptors and attract researchers from Harvard, NYC, Brown and MIT to discuss this issue in particular.  I also hope to further develop an indoor air-pollution focus in collaboration with Asthma files researchers at RPI and the roomba project as well as the spectrometer.  In terms of general water quality testing, I hope to further understand Matt’s work in this area and work to bring Public lab together with one-earth designs researchers in Pittsburgh, Sense it in NYC and water canary.  I would like to continue supporting tool development on indoor air-quality such as the roomba and spectrometry approaches, I would like us to purse at least 2 other speculative tools directed at health and toxics.  I would like us to start 1 or 2 research sites focused on toxics.

Over this next year with public laboratory I aim to prototype home testing for endocrine disruptors by pursuing one project idea immediately that I think has legs: I intend to adapt home beer brewing equipment to grow estrogen sensitivity yeast strains which glow in the presence of estrogens so that public lab can begin testing water sources around the states for estrogencity.

<strong>RISD/Brown/Public Laboratory Research Group:</strong>
The goal of this group will be to develop tools for public laboratory, novel means of interacting with/visualizing data generated by public lab and to develop local research sites. Tools development will focus on issues of Toxics from indoor air-quality to endocrine disruptors. I hope to attract researchers from Brown, Harvard and NYC into collaborative development of home testing for endocrine disruptors. I may try to find one student to support this work but this will be my research focus for the year. I intend to encourage the students to participate in existing projects or develop their own.  We will have some kind of gallery show based on the research group’s work during the year.

<strong>Continuing field research:</strong>
I also aim to further develop public labs work in gas patch communities in NY, PA, OH, TX, CO and NM this will involve working with ExtrAct, scholars and communities in this field--I may do a short speaking tour in the gas patch over the fall--I will also be preparing my dissertation manuscript for publication by Duke University.

I hope to help get a tar sands project up running as well in coordination with Shannon.

<strong>Anthropological/follow-up research:</strong>
Working closely with Shannon (and anyone else whose interested), I aim to begin archiving and analyzing our research process and tool development work for social science academic press articles about us. I see 4S and AAA papers as a spring board for that work. I also see this as tying into our Knight evaluation process. By June I’d like Public Lab to have at least one academic paper in peer review.

<strong>Teaching: RISD Art/Lab Class:</strong>
I intend to develop curriculum that crosses over between Art/Lab and Public Lab and use the class to cultivate student interest in the RISD research group and public lab.  Matt and I will be sharing curriculum development and trying to foster collaboration between PNCA and RISD.

<strong>Plans for the future:
Professional development:</strong>
I hope that over this year I can find a university department that is really supportive of Public Lab that I could make into a more permanent academic home-base, either as a post doc or ideally on some kind of tenure track.

<strong>Personal development:</strong>
I really want to know how to make stuff myself! I’m hoping that while in Providence I can take fab academy classes and learn some making basics. Shannon and I will team up on this.
