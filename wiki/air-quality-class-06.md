<strong>Cleaning our Data</strong>:

* Pick one day that all eggs have data for, say Feb 25.
* Extract data for that day from each egg, placing each egg's data on its own tab in one google spreadsheet, and making a final tab with data from all eggs. 
* Remove extra rows so that it is only once every 5 minutes
* Email the link to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ar9IZUm100zKdE1iblo2MHA0bDF4b01XcEhHd1pEUWc#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>. 

<strong>In class: </strong>

* Facilitators set up a workstation at the side of the classroom. 
* In small groups, youth will open up the spreadsheet on laptops and pick a particular "egg tab" to work on. 
* Youth will use "insert --> chart" functions in Google Spreadsheet to visualize temperature with humidity. Experiment with line and radar chart types. (5-7 minutes)
* Get out markers and chart papers. Facilitator quickly sketches examples of what a creative line/landscape chart or radar/clock chart would look like. Ask the youth which type of chart would they like to experiment with -- either "line" or "clock", and group them by 2s and 3s accordingly. (5 minutes)
* Close all laptops except one per group. Facilitators make rounds to help students set up the axes of their creative graphs on paper. Appoint one student in each group to use the laptop and "view" tool to find datapoints once per hour on the Google Spreadsheet line charts and call them out to their teammates to plot on paper. Facilitators help youth get started plotting data from the spreadsheet onto their own visualization scaffolding. (60 minutes)
* When students have plotted most of their data, facilitators go around and ask/suggest adding color, arrows, or text to highlight the significant moments in the 24 hours of data. Add titles and names. 
* Youth present their visualizations at the end of class.
