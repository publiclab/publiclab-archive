###Urgent###

* an *actual* internal budget
* consensus on FT/PT -- in the absence of having made that decision before
  * who wants what, who *can* do what?
  * who would take a FT position if it were available?
  * separate: willingness, ability, preference, insistence to work PT or FT
  * what, organizationally, should be the review/prerequisite process for accepting a FT "applicant"? a plan of work? Stewart & Shannon did one; we could base on that.
  * How we value different types of work
  * How we prioritize types of work

###General organizational decision making###

* rotating topic-based decision making teams to reduce burden
  * few teams with broad categories, like: Publishing, Data Outreach, Kits, Tool Research, Evaluation, Communities
  * each time has 3 members, each staff member has 2-3 team memberships?
