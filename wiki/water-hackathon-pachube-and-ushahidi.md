<strong>What:</strong> The Water Hackathon is a collaborative effort between Pachube, Ushahidi, Citizen Sensor, DontFlush.Me and Public Laboratory -- and is open to all comers!

<strong>Where:</strong> Parsons the New School for Design 6 E 16th Street, 12th Floor. Bring a state-issued ID to sign in. 

<strong>When: March 23-25, 2012</strong>
<strong>Schedule overview:</strong> We will start with an evening mixer on Friday night to form groups and talk about projects, hack all day Saturday and show our work in a public session that evening. On Sunday, some software teams will continue to work in the Parsons space, while hardware teams will head out to the Gowanus to test their creations. 

<strong>Friday 23</strong>
7:00pm (space opens at 6pm) Ignite talks by:
Water for the People -- Ned Breslin
Don’t Flush Me -- Leif Percifield
Public Laboratory -- Eymund, thermal fishing bob "GO SCUM"
Public Laboratory -- Sara -- environmental estrogen yeast bioassay, spectroscopy 
Water Voices -- (this one may come with a ca$h prize)
Pachube -- services available
Ushahidi -- Dale, SudanWater
Atlas Scientific -- Jordan Press
North Brooklyn Boat Club -- Jens Rasmussen'
EPA volunteer water monitoring program --  Paula (cancelled)

<strong>Saturday 24</strong>
10:00 - 6:00pm Hacking -- we'll start by organizing into teams. 
7:00 - 9:00pm Public Presentations -- come see what everyone's made!

<strong>Sunday 25</strong> Two concurrent events -- pick one as they are located an hour away from each other: 
Test it outside: canoeing on the Gowanus. NEW LOCATION Meet at the <a href="http://www.gowanuscanal.org/">Gowanus Dredgers</a> 2nd Street Canal Launch Site: Take the <strong>F</strong> or <strong>G</strong> to Carroll Street - exit to front of Bklyn-bound train, cross Smith Street and walk three blocks down 2nd Street to the Canal.
Keep coding: Software teams working on the Ushahidi <-> Pachube bridge may continue to work in the Parsons space.

<strong>
Meetup Description:</strong> Come hack water with Pachube, Ushahidi, and PublicLaboratory.org. We will be exploring how we can crowdsource water quality information, connect real-time data and citizen observed reports with a Pachube<->Ushahidi linkup, build our own investigative tools, and contribute to social issues affecting our local area here in NYC.

<strong>Ideas:</strong> The Public Laboratory community will be bringing some water quality related tools/parts/ideas to hack on, for example, a hand-held near-infrared <a href="/tool/spectrometer">spectrometer</a> that can identify commonly found contaminants like polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), two options for a <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/turbidity-sensor">turbidity meter</a> (one featuring an inexpensive light sensor and LED to create controlled lighting conditions, the other based on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Z8tmVe19cu3z0X4PzvXQA7228orwcwIWU8alSdFUt20/edit">smart phone</a>), and a thermal “<a href="/wiki/thermal-fishing-bob">fishing bob</a>” which changes color depending on the temperature of the water it touches. Also up for discussion is the <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/environmental-estrogen-testing">yeast-based YESassay</a> which changes the color of a reactant when in the presence of environmental estrogens (like BPA).

Other ideas include "sewer surveillance," dye tracing during rain events, and underwater acoustic mapping. The <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/BioBoard">BioBoard</a> is a related initiative emerging from <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge">NoiseBridge</a> in SF. 

<strong>Support:</strong> We are seeking sponsorship for materials and supplies from Pachube and Future Electronics/Melexis.
