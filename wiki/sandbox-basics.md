## What is community science?

At Public Lab, community science is science for everyone. It strives to use accessible and adaptable research tools and share data. It values a variety of lived and learned experiences in addressing issues with environmental health. It centers people with environmental concerns in their local community, where they define research questions, plan studies and collect data, and use that data to pursue accountability. And all kinds of people collaborate! People with experience in science, hardware and software, law and policy, education, grassroots community organizing, and more‚Äìvarious kinds of knowledge and practices come together in community science to work toward a healthier environment for all.

In an essay published in 2017, @Shannon and @gretchengehrke defined community science as 

>‚Äú‚Ä¶collaboratively-led scientific investigation and exploration to address community defined questions, allowing for engagement in the entirety of the scientific process. Unique in comparison to citizen science, community science may or may not include partnerships with professional scientists, emphasizes the community‚Äôs ownership of research and access to resulting data, and orients towards community goals and working together in scalable networks to encourage collaborative learning and civic engagement.‚Äù
