###Organization###

* Conduct
* responsibility
* holding votes- if all on phone call at same time and make agreement, can be seen as a vote, otherwise needs to be formal vote process. Needs to be a distinct proposal in writing that everyone can see- same doc. and same info that everyone can see.
- Combine written proposal with a verbal briefing- everyone should have access to terms of what they are voting for in clear and concise fashion. In vote itself is a good place for it to happen.
- Mathew- administrative tasks and voting- difficult to keep up with all admin things that had to be done- beyond email, more centralized org. docs that we are using- all org. systems are about comm.- email, Google docs, campfire, etc. Need slower, more formalized documents- short list- whats going on billboard across org.
Point person for people to check in with if they have an absence
Place extra emphasis on calling votes early- calling a vote and what is needed

Jeff’s proposal:

* ALL decisions, and especially those involving transactions of over $1000, require a concise, itemized public proposal -- it can evolve/be edited, but it must be a consistent document (wiki or Google Doc) which all parties can view.
* Votes can be rushed (voters should be aware that they can decline to vote on a rushed vote on procedural grounds, without that being construed as a vote **against** per se). But typically votes are posted Thurs-Sun or Mon-Wed.
* Votes must include all relevant information or risk being abandoned due to incompleteness. A public shared proposal ahead of time is the best way to make sure everyone is on the same page.

* Manpriya- Shannon and Sara coordinate on this
* Adam and Sara- vote on parking and taxis
