The bittorrent sync link on https://publiclab.org/wiki/sharing-images does not work?

(The attached image here just looks pretty. It was an RG-NIR shot, processed with FIJI). 

I'm actually looking for sample blue/red pass filtered imagery? Would you know where to find some?

+liz@publiclab You also said "ping me if need be" with a link to https://publiclab.org/wiki/liz@publiclab.org. 

So I'm creating this page anyway :P
