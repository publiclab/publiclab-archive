[Pipeline Mapping](http://publiclab.org/wiki/pipeline-mapping) is a project initiated by Public Lab organizer and Fulbright scholar [Ann Chen](/profile/ann) to collectively map the Northern Gateway Pipeline route through aerial imagery, oral histories, field recordings, photos and video. From October 1, 2014 - July 1, 2015, she will be traveling along the Northern Gateway Pipeline route organizing aerial mapping workshops with local communities to create an environmental picture and story about these places.
