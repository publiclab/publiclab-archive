We have several ways to participate in the Public Lab chatroom; the easiest is listed first. For other methods, scroll down!

<!-- basic chatroom no longer works due to anti-abuse measures 

### Basic chatroom

Get started quick, no installation needed! Real name is optional:

<iframe style="border:0;" src="https://chat.publiclab.org" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>

(<b>Open this in new window:</b> <a target="_blank" href="https://chat.publiclab.org">https://chat.publiclab.org</a>)

-->

We've bridged together a number of different chatroom systems, so you can use one you're comfortable with. 

****

### Element/Matrix

Our "home" service is Element (a Matrix chat client) in the room `#publiclab`:

[Public Lab Element chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/#publiclab:matrix.org)

**Because this is where we "connect" all the chatrooms together, it tends to be the smoothest experience with the most features.** 

It includes file upload, voice chat, and notifications. Matrix also offers several clients for iOS and Android devices: https://element.io

### Gitter

Many folks participating via GitHub use [Gitter.im](https://Gitter.im), and we've also bridged that with the "main" Element/Matrix chatroom:

https://gitter.im/publiclab/publiclab

However, Gitter was [bought by Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/30/welcoming-gitter-to-matrix) and is slowly being changed into a Matrix service. This is slow and not completely smooth (although we appreciate it!) so the two systems are gradually becoming the same -- compatibility is improving! Track this process [here](https://www.matrix.org/docs/projects/bridge/native-gitter-bridge)  and the next big milestone is [bridging private rooms](https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/issues/2785).

## IRC

Unfortunately, due to excessive offensive posts (see our [Code of Conduct](/conduct)) through the IRC chat system, we have turned off messaging for new chat participants who join over IRC. This means you will only be able to read the chat, not post your own messages. To participate actively, please use another system like Gitter or Matrix/Element.

<!--
**Exemptions:** we have made sure that if you join using the "mini" chatroom at the top of this page, or https://chat.publiclab.org, you will not be affected by this rule. Likewise, those who join via Riot/Matrix, Gitter, or Slack will be unaffected. 

Of course we are happy to individually exempt you as well; please email web@publiclab.org with your IRC username to be exempted, or DM somebody in the channel. (we are working to create an automated exemption system using [plotsbot]() as well)
-->

We apologize for this necessity!
