Hello,
Big fan of Public Lab, first time user.

I am the Mayor of a town in Colorado called Berthoud. I am creating a large map of Town to identify upward shooting lights that produce sky glow and affect our ability to see the stars. Since this is turning into a large map I am wondering if there is a way to save my map and continue on a different computer,  or do I need to keep the Map open in a tab on my current computer.

Also, is there any possibility to have multiple users contributing to my ongoing map?  

Thank You!


Will
