A cut-off soda bottle can be used as a cheap camera mounting because the camera sits snugly against the inside of the bottle. The camera is also effectively protected from impacts - a disadvantage of the Picavet suspension.

You can also follow this visual step by step instructions  below: 

Tools you'll need

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864715356/" title="minimum tool set to build the aerial photography camera mount by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4864715356_f3bd139a7b.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="minimum tool set to build the aerial photography camera mount" /></a>


Drill the bottom of the bottle

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864106039/" title="drill the bottom by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4864106039_5c46063c44.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="drill the bottom" /></a>


Cut the bottom of the bottle : 

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864123023/" title="pinch to cut by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4864123023_11a4fb9df8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="pinch to cut" /></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864129573/" title="cut the bottom of the bottle just above the mold marks by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4864129573_7d6b868768.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="cut the bottom of the bottle just above the mold marks" /></a>

Insert the bottom of the bottle you just cut in the bottle itself until the head :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864313809/" title="take the cut bottom, reverse it, push it in by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4864313809_790f06c884.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="take the cut bottom, reverse it, push it in" /></a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864941040/" title="Push it in ! by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4864941040_b54cce0312.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Push it in !" /></a>

Cut a large strip of the bottle, leaving enough on the bottle head side to host a camera :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864949418/" title="Leave enough on the head side to contain the camera by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4864949418_ddd4673996.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Leave enough on the head side to contain the camera" /></a>

Cut the large stripe :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864953918/" title="Ok, that's the center part. This will become the wings of the camera mount by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4864953918_2b2be5219e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Ok, that's the center part. This will become the wings of the camera mount" /></a>

Cut the large stripe in the length :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864960934/" title="cut this large strip in 2 narrow ones by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4864960934_2a448dc179.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="cut this large strip in 2 narrow ones" /></a>

Now you have 2 narrow stripes : 

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864349509/" title="a large strip becomes 2 narrow strips by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4864349509_dbd9b2239c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="a large strip becomes 2 narrow strips" /></a>

Fold them in 2 in the length :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864358453/" title="The strip roll by themselves, but if you fold them, they stay in place strong by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4864358453_22b0a25ef5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="The strip roll by themselves, but if you fold them, they stay in place strong" /></a>

Both of them :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4865132976/" title="Now you have 2 separated wings and a big body by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4865132976_b20a35ab86.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Now you have 2 separated wings and a big body" /></a>

Cut the end of each of the narrow stripes in a "pig feet" :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4865145150/" title="open the long strip as a &quot;pig foot&quot; by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4865145150_ee40b8dc75.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="open the long strip as a &quot;pig foot&quot;" /></a>

If you have a welder, you can make the "pig feet" more durable by "welding" the end of the cut : 

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864529951/" title="if you can &quot;weld&quot; the hole, it is much stronger than simple cut. by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4864529951_fc4e888332.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="if you can &quot;weld&quot; the hole, it is much stronger than simple cut." /></a>

Put "feet to feet" the folded stripes :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864534061/" title="Now you have 2 long strips - I call these &quot;wings&quot; by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4864534061_5783cc1b46.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Now you have 2 long strips - I call these &quot;wings&quot;" /></a>

Duct tape one side of the "feet nails" :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864538479/" title="tapped together! by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4864538479_0bb67002ce.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="tapped together!" /></a>

Mark where you want to insert the feets :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4865161556/" title="check out how big of a hole you need to pass these wings in the body by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4114/4865161556_aab6f548e8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="check out how big of a hole you need to pass these wings in the body" /></a>

With a blade - ideally with the soldering iron, make a cut the width of the stripe :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4865165122/" title="prepare a little hole on the overlap, to pass the wings by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4865165122_6ab5a412f1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="prepare a little hole on the overlap, to pass the wings" /></a>

Insert the "wings" :)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4865170350/" title="Get the wings through the body by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4865170350_1a6d380366.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Get the wings through the body" /></a>

Tape the wings in :

Almost there, nice! Taking shape!

Pass the long thin rope through the nozzle :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4865181664/" title="pull the end of your thread through the head and perforated bottom by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4865181664_c5a7118eb6.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="pull the end of your thread through the head and perforated bottom" /></a>

Make 2 loops (4 threads) with the thread : 

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864565467/" title="one thread turned into 2 loops by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4864565467_ca624a9557.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="one thread turned into 2 loops" /></a>

Adjust the tension of the 2 loops :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864572737/" title="the threads will hold like that, you will  put duct tape to set up the camera. by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4114/4864572737_e429423706.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="the threads will hold like that, you will  put duct tape to set up the camera." /></a>

A simple knot with the 4 threads in :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864568959/" title="simple knot with 4 threads coming into 2 loops by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4864568959_5813043ab9.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="simple knot with 4 threads coming into 2 loops" /></a>

Fix the threads with string tape to camera (real strong, if you use bad tape your camera may fall from 500ft in the water / in the sand / on the rocks :_(

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864575903/" title="Fix the camera threads tension to have a well-balanced positioning by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4864575903_ace10915a7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Fix the camera threads tension to have a well-balanced positioning" /></a>

Pull the rope back in the body :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864579581/" title="Pull the camera up ... by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4864579581_d57c4bee35.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Pull the camera up ..." /></a>

Pull stronger till the camera doesn't move much anymore:

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4865203202/" title="Adjust the camera in the mount by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4865203202_6d658b65fc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Adjust the camera in the mount" /></a>

Screw the cap in, with the threads forced (and probably twisted while you screw in):

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864587045/" title="Good! Fixed! by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4864587045_b93ea5e0bf.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Good! Fixed!" /></a>

The screw cap with hold the 4 threads securely, it easier to adjust, and also be easy to remove :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4865209896/" title="the cap is holding the rope and adjusting the tension by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4865209896_f532f90652.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="the cap is holding the rope and adjusting the tension" /></a>

Test the balance of your devicem ideally with a fan, your camera mount should swing gently in the wind and follow the wind like a weather vane :)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4865213258/" title="here, we go ! by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4095/4865213258_3f79e138ac.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="here, we go !" /></a>

To avoid having of the mount with the pictures you take, you can crop the extra plastic :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864597621/" title="I recommend to remove a bit of the plastic in order to avoid having the edge of the bottle in every single shot :) by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/4864597621_c2cb75ca89.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="I recommend to remove a bit of the plastic in order to avoid having the edge of the bottle in every single shot :)" /></a>

If you want to avoid turbulence and aggravate wind drag you can make fringes at the end of each wings :

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldworldworld/4864604241/" title="I cut little fringes to add drag in the air by cesarharada.com, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4119/4864604241_8899657982.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="I cut little fringes to add drag in the air" /></a>

You are ready to fly !
