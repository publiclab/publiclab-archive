##Community Focus:##

Goals in each project site, how we will distribute PLOTS resources

1. How do we want to distribute our resources/time at project sites currently in place? What are the goals going forward for each of these sites? Is there a timeline or are they ongoing?

###Current Sites (Core):###

Project Partners rolladex- lets get those contacts together-


Gulf - space for Shannon? Jeff, Stewart, Shannon, Adam
NYC - Staff - Liz, Board - Eymund, committed volunteers - Leif, Ray, John Donnelly, etc (see NYC doc). 
Space: looking for space.
Butte - Mathew, Olivia Everett, National Affordable Housing Network, Silver Bow Archives
Somerville/Boston - Parts and Crafts (spectrometer), SPROUT, local ag monitoring, leverage students/orgs that are there- tool dev. that can happen there outside comm. projects

	Space: Pirate ship
Providence-

	Space: RISD research group
Definition of site: Has permanent location? has full or part-time employee? 

What do we want to do with the sites that we are involved in over the course of the year?

	lightning funding proposal strategy. We each spend 3 days on a site over the next three weeks, creating a three-month budget process for each site, and then pay out ¼ of funding...

Emerging Sites (potential core mission sites): People who have approached us?
Zeega-Superfund site- Boston? all over?
Tar Sands
Santiago-Intelligent Citizen
Austin, Texas
Jerusalem
appalachian mountain-top removal
hydro-fracking areas

Business contracting / international development consulting structure:
Togo
Rio
Salt Lake City?
Belize?

###Moving forward:###

Liz to abstract her document about NYC
Sara to look into evaluation process for Knight
We will fill out this form for site we are working and site we want to bring online
lightning funding proposal strategy. We each spend 3 days on a site over the next three weeks, creating a three-month budget process for each site, and then pay out ¼ of funding...Jeff and Shannon to look at feasibility just of budget (which bits of budget, how much is the whole amount)

2-3 days for directions we are thinking of- compile list for budget we are working with

###NOTES:###

Mat: EPA grant to look at.
http://www.epa.gov/ncer/sbir/
its about approaching businesses for partnerships, not just schools

Research Hubs: (should we make this a formal category?)--we have some problems with that
Boston
RISD
NYC?

2. Distribution of resources to new sites- what will our determining factors be? How, as a staff will we choose new project sites to work at? How will we determine what funding goes to these new sites (this is outside the scope of our community granting program in year two)

3. Are we interested in only long-term projects or also one time or short-term projects?
	- short projects could be framed as (or required to be) pilot projects or exploratory ones which could lead to or support larger projects

4. How will we distribute funding, equipment, people to each site that we are working at? This includes things such as workspace, kit equipment, shipping costs
idea for lightning funding: take all site/tool/equip money and fund a series of short proposals generated over 21 days.
