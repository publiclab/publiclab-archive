Questions for H2S testing

* are we still developing electronic sensors? weren’t they not sensitive enough?
* acute vs. long-term hazardous exposure levels. 

* accessibility of development process -- need lab for safety?  no--
  * send mathew test strips and he will do “bokashi” comparison

Goal for month: Follow up with James? Organize research notes better, acceptable exposure levels--get mat started on this.
Proposed goal for three months: identify ways to test this without a gas well - like with compost or poop, more public events to build/test this tool, calibrate with LUMCON, Intrepretation
Proposed goal for six months: Field testing, more photos of this being built/tested
Proposed over all goal for year: - consolidation of build instructions and price lists

2012 tool goals:

* more public events to build/test this tool
* identify ways to test this without a gas well - like with compost or poop
* better identify specific sites where it could be useful, or it could be tested. exact locations, like “Rick’s backyard” or “my faucet”
* once data is captured and documented with the prototype, starting to think about how that information can be presented/analyzed, incorporated into effecting change -- how do you act on it? storyboards...
* consolidation of build instructions and price lists

Overall: looks good, could use a bit of work on organizing the research for newcomers, ready for fieldwork and testing in public events.

###History/context of tool###

* what inspired it? Garfield, CO, h2s sink contamination
* who (all) designed/developed/tested it? Where? - James Schaffroth and Sara Wylie. Jeff Warren (digital) Shannon Dosemagen, Battlement Mesa Citizen's Alliance, and LUMCON.
* where has it been used and how did it go? - James’ Providence, RI apartment, ongoing? 
* how specialized is demand for the tool? - mostly in gas extraction sites?

###Replicability###

* documentation, transmission to new users - leading image of circuit board is nice, notes offer Arduino code. James’ diagram is nice but a bit abstract 
  * exposure level info
* tools needed? - good listing of materials for film technique, require a little bit of digging in the research notes. No parts list for circuit but good photographs and diagrams (with a bit of digging)
* skills needed? - what knowledge does it assume? difficulty? - Film technique seems manageable by almost anyone. Circuit technique assumes Arduino familiarity.
* materials needed - supply chain limitations - good links for purchasing all film materials, though no price list apparent. no clear parts list for circuit and no link to where to purchase the figaro sensor.
* safety - exposure to H2S warnings might be a good idea

###Development###

* what is it costing us in staff hours?
* what is it costing in materials? - no price lists yet (incorrect, there are, but buried)
* COTS (consumer-off-the-shelf) effects - Very nice reuse of film, should be easy to get a hold of. Arduino is easy to acquire in many places, but the Figaro sensor may be a bottleneck

###Maintenance###

* what are the per-use costs? - unknown, early stage
* what are wearing parts? (frequency of replacement) - unknown, early stage

###Accessibility/legibility###

* are there opportunities for people to participate/contribute - ample and well-described, in text, on the tool page. No events though.
* formats: online/offline? - film requires no digital parts at all. Arduino will result in a long text log, which could benefit from overlay on a map, or graphing over time, and an easier way to view/browse data.
* cost? (dollars, time) - posted for figaro sensor but nothing else that I could find, but early stage
* access to materials, components - see above, Figaro sensor bottleneck. Film sounds fine.
* language barrier? - early stage
* language: domain-specific, insider/outsider - very accessible, not much jargon (“assay”). Could better show an actual strip of film before/after exposure.

###Change effected###

* how has it measurably/materially affected:
 * local ecology - early stage
* available/actionable information? - early stage, would be nice to see this tested soon
* decision making - early stage
* legal, policy, regulatory - early stage
* enables participation in a formerly closed information loop - could use some context about how gasfield workers use sensors already and the availability/ability/cost of commercial sensors on the market already. But yes, most people don’t have these, so if people get/use them, this will improve

##Future:##

2012 tool goals:

* Field testing, more photos of this being built/tested
* more public events to build/test this tool
* identify ways to test this without a gas well - like with compost or poop
* better identify specific sites where it could be useful, or it could be tested. exact locations, like “Rick’s backyard” or “my faucet”
*  once data is captured and documented with the prototype, starting to think about how that information can be presented/analyzed, incorporated into effecting change -- how do you act on it? storyboards...
* consolidation of build instructions and price lists

Overall: looks good, could use a bit of work on organizing the research for newcomers, ready for fieldwork and testing in public events.
