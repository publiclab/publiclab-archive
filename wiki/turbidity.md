As explained [in @donblair's primer](/notes/donblair/08-25-2015/turbidity-001), measuring turbidity means "measuring the amount of suspended solids in water -- solids that haven't fully dissolved". That is, "turbidity, an optical technique for assessing suspended solids in liquid -- is an important water quality parameter. Typically, light is shone into a liquid sample, and the amount of light scattered back out of the sample (off of particles suspended in it) is measured; the intensity of this scattered light is considered to be related to the amount of suspended solids in the sample." ([reference](/wiki/turbidity_sensing))

## Sensors

Here's a list of different turbidity sensors and measurement systems. See below for some Do-It-Yourself approaches to measuring turbidity, and [this page](https://publiclab.org/wiki/turbidity_sensing) for more information on how turbidity sensors works.
