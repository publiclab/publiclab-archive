This page lists recent and urgent requests of all kinds across the Public Lab network, for those looking to pitch in on others' projects and needs.  

## Welcome to Public Lab!

As a network of many organizations and people across the world, **we rely on the power of peer support** for most of what we do. While the Public Lab staff is only around 10 people, our network reaches tens of thousands, with many different experiences and talents. We need you!

There are many different ways you can pitch in! We've compiled some below -- take a look and get involved!

## Featured requests

Here are some higher-priority requests we'd like to highlight:

This page is just getting started, but we'll be adding more as we build out this collection of requests. Please [leave a comment on this page](/wiki/requests/comments?body=I'd like to make a request for ...) if you'd like to submit a request!

## Help find assistance for people

Sometimes people need help getting the word out or finding folks nearby to help map. There are a number of ways you can help -- but first, use this link to subscribe so you get an email when people post a request:

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="/subscribe/tag/requests">Subscribe to receive emails</a> _when requests are posted_

Some things you can do:

* forward the request to [the relevant local discussion list](/lists)
* tweet out the request or post it on Facebook
* forward the request along to people you know working in the area
* use a comment (and the `@username` syntax) to connect the requester with someone in their area who's posted on this site

Open to ideas on how you can help -- please add to this page!
