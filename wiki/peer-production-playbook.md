Peer Production Playbook (rough)

(Possibly preceded in timeline by initial phase being prototyped by Liz)
(Possibly preceded in timeline by some in-person question refinement being prototyping by Stevie)

- Collect Qs on a topic
- hit the lists, SM
- Post Questions ~2x per week
- schedule as much as possible
- lists, SM
- alternate topical/regional lists to avoid saturation
- Collect a batch of Qs in a wiki page, add an intro with: goals, constraints, related work
- Call for stories and existing projects/groups to add to wiki
- lists, SM

====MORE SPECULATIVE BELOW THIS LINE====

- Ask for input/suggestions on constraints via question: who frames the needs?
- lists, SM
- Ask for pros/cons (facilitation method) on different approaches
- lists, SM
- Compile list of next steps/challenges
- lists, SM
- Break down challenges with new Qs
- Support challenges with protokits (or earlier!)

...somewhere in the above sequence, identify leaders who can co-facilitate this process

Who are we prototyping this with?
* Remediation Kit folks
* Balloon Kit relaunch
* Fair Tech Collective
* Various photo monitoring
* Riffle group
