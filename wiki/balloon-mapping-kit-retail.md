This kit, offered for sale by Public Laboratory's nonprofit arm, is the result of experiments in DIY [balloon mapping](http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/balloon-mapping). They were available through the [Balloon Mapping Kits Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1775485688/balloon-mapping-kits) and now online through Breadpig.

###[Balloon Mapping Kits in the Public Lab store &raquo;](http://store.publiclab.org/products/balloon-mapping-kit)###


The kit is based on the more in-depth description of balloon mapping kit materials here: http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/balloon-mapping-materials

###Useful links###

* [MapKnitter](https://mapknitter.org) for stitching your aerial photos into online/digital maps
* [The Public Laboratory Archive](/archive) - a repository of open data maps produced mostly with balloons and kites, by independent "grassroots mappers"
* [Register](/join) on this site to take part in the growing Public Laboratory open source community and get support from other balloon mappers
* [Kite mapping](/tool/kite-mapping) is a good alternative to balloons in areas where helium is hard to come by
* Check out [near-infrared photography](/tool/near-infrared-camera) for using your kit with an additional infrared camera to analyze vegetation

###Each kit contains:###

* A [Qualatex 5.5' (170cm) "Cloudbuster" Chloroprene balloon](http://www.qualatex.com/downloads/catalogs/06vbcat/cloudbuster.pdf)
  * latex/chloroprene (neoprene) mix, making it UV resistant, fairly tear resistant, and excellent at retaining helium.  Two-four days of flights can be had with one filling of helium.

* A custom-wound 8" or 9" hoop winder and 1000' (300m) of 110lb (50kg) line, [from Shanti Kites](http://shantikites.com/single-line-flying/shanti-hoops-yoyo-winders/)
  * We tracked these back to the factory and are having them custom wound.  No other winder is sold with more than 500' of line.

* [A pair of cotton work gloves palm-coated with rubber](http://www.mcmaster.com/#catalog/118/1774/=gb4i4a) to get a grip while bringing the balloon in and prevent rope burns.

* Three 170lb Coastlock [Mighty-Mini Snap Swivels](http://www.americanfishingwire.com/mmsnapswivels.asp) we use these because they're the [only ones that are lead free](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/mathew/1-30-2012/lead-brass-snap-swivels) (one spare)

* Twenty #64 [latex-free rubber bands](http://www.mcmaster.com/#catalog/118/1986/=gb4i4q). We use these because they don't get brittle in the cold like latex rubber bands.  They are for the [camera rig](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/pet-bottle-rubber-band-rig) (one spare)
