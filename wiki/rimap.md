Welcome! Public Lab is developing a number of community mapping projects, and we would love your input. 

Collaborations with both One Cranston and the Brown University Superfund Research Program are leading towards interactive maps where you can add your own story.

## Unearthing Providence

Brown University researchers have collected a database of past and currently active industrial sites in Rhode Island, and are looking for community observations and stories related to these sites.
