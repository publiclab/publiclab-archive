The Picavet rig has a long history-- developed in the 19th century for kite aerial photography and rediscovered in the 1980's.  It uses a continuous loop of string through four points on a platform and 2 or 4 points above to automatically level a platform. 

Quality commercial kits are available from [Brooks Leffler](http://www.brooxes.com/newsite/BBKK/KITS.html),  [KapShop](http://www.kapshop.com/) and [Kaptery](http://kaptery.com/)

Several mappers have built simple variations of the Picavet:

* Chris Fastie built [a dual-camera Picavet rig](/notes/cfastie/2-22-2012/dual-camera-kap-rig) and has a great video showing its construction and first flight. The design and instructions for building Chris's 3D printed Picavet are available at the [KAPtery](http://kaptery.com/products/?f=category&id=24).

* Michele Tobais uses a [Picavet rig built on a trash can to provide extra protection  for huge cameras](/wiki/trash-can-rig-heavy-cameras)

* Jessi Breen is [developing a mini-cd crate picavet to protect her camera](/notes/jbreen/3-6-2012/evolution-picavet)

* Ted Fjallman builds [Picavets from reused plywood that are very light and durable](/notes/TedF/08-18-2013/constructing-a-2-90g-wooden-metal-picavet)

* The [FABA collective has made a picavet](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/juan/6-5-2012/fabaoutfit-vertical-kap-and-bap) similar to Michele's trash can rig but with a few ingenious uses of rubberbands and springs.  Definitely worth integrating into your kit.

* Mathew Lippincott has a simple modification of [the PET bottle rig](/wiki/pet-bottle-rubber-band-rig) [to add a picavet rigging](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/mathew/2-5-2012/picavet-pet-rig)

For those with access to laser cutters, Myles has made a [laser-cut picavet rigging that mounts on a bottle top](http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/mathew/8-29-2012/laser-cut-picavet-pet-bottle-rig).  His most ingenious innovation is the use of bike chain links as pulleys.
