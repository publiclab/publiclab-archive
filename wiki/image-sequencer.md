Image Sequencer is an online tool for image processing -- based on the idea of a storyboard. Each modification makes a new copy of the image, resulting in a series of images showing each step. It is designed for use in browsers, as well as on the [Raspberry Pi](/pi-camera). This project is supported in part by the [NASA AREN project](/aren)

## Why

Image Sequencer is different from other image processing systems in that it's **non-destructive**: instead of modifying the original image, it creates a new image at each step in a sequence. This is because it:

* produces a legible trail of operations, to "show your work" for evidential, educational, or reproducibility reasons
* makes the creation of new tools or "modules" simpler -- [each must accept an input image, and produce an output image](https://github.com/publiclab/image-sequencer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* allows many images to be run through the same sequence of steps - batch processing
* works identically in the browser, on Node.js, and on the command line

## NDVI

There's now an "NDVI" feature in MapKnitter -- a beta -- for converting the images you upload with the #NDVI equation. It's set up for red filters only right now, but more will come. 

It uses Image Sequencer to do the conversion, which is temporary - your map is not affected, so think of it as a "filter" you can turn on.
