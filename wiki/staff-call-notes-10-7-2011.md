###Collaborations###

* finally heard back from Carlos at East Harlem Tutorial Program EHTP. They were busy starting an entire charter school, and their high school “STEM” program started this week and they are looking to fill some timeslots before January. Teaching options: Tuesday / Thursday afterschool with freshmen and sophmores, Wednesday afternoon with juniors and seniors. Next Steps: Set up a thermal camera hacking afternoon in NYC - maybe Monday night October 17.
* Tom MacWright (dev seed) - My Superfund - PAH site nearby Boston - http://macwright.org/superfund/ 
* EoI went into UNICEF on Monday, haven’t heard back about next phase contract.
* UGANDA?? what is this $60K for 6 months (6 weeks in country)? please forward the email. broader research community vs PLOTS staff. Chris C. has mentioned this opportunity to Leif, but we need to learn more. The original pitch seemed to say “we have money and nothing else, and you need money and will do anything to get it” - so it was dismissed. What about PLOTS taking overhead from a large contract like this? People in the community taking on projects where we aren’t staff, we allow ourselves to be available as support staff and take overhead. 

* Butte - writing MOU to situate plots tools in housing and urban redevelopment context. 
* LAGCC at Newtown Creek - Sunday 9th call. 
* what is ongoing relationship between GCM and PLOTS? if they start ballooning at every site assessment, what is our relationship?

* BROADLY -- what about a large organization using us to help them work with mapping in someone else’s community? like UNICEF, like GCM perhaps. lateral partnerships.
