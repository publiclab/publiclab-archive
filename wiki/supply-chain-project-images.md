Collecting a set of images for the [BFAMFAPHD](http://bfamfaphd.com/) project's Supply Chain project. 

### SOURCE

an image of a material used, in the location it was found 
(for example, a CD found on the street, or a CD found in a thrift store, or in a friends' basement)

Making balloon mapping kit "bottle rigs" from used soda bottles via @clauds: https://publiclab.org/notes/clauds/09-03-2015/a-public-lab-chapter-in-bourj-al-shamali


### LABOR

an image of the group that worked on that project, working together, or a diagram of how you work together with a board and volunteers
(this could also possibly be a chat room)

Working together at a workshop via @liz: https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/11-10-2015/pictures-from-llactalab-workshop

### TOOL

an image of tools used, plus who has access to them
(this could be someone looking at their laptop, or a workshop)

Great pics via @hagitkeysar's profile page, which is also just generally a great source of images you can use with CC-BY-SA attribution:

### TRANSFER

an image of an exchange or payment or free gift symbol
(this is hard, but this is about how people who work on this are paid or how people who experience PublicLab spectrometers or other objects receive them)

Maybe this via @liz: https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/08-25-2015/fkit-on-the-move


### COPYRIGHT

CC-BY-SA

### ENCOUNTER

an image of people looking at the final work 
(ideally in a museum / gallery context, or in a big public context like with the balloon)

@derekhoeferlin's photos of the River Rat Pack [exhibition in St. Louis](/notes/derekhoeferlin/05-09-2016/public-lab-river-rat-pack-st-louis-exhibition):

### NARRATE

how do people learn about the project / feel its validity
an image of you talking about the project, in a lecture hall or book, or news article




### ACQUIRE

who holds on to these objects to steward them
perhaps an image of a public collection or personal collection

@hagitkeysar's image of [a lending library](/notes/hagitkeysar/07-28-2015/a-lending-library-shipping-and-other-troubles-in-the-holyland): 

[![lending](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/911/large/Screen_Shot_2015-07-28_at_22.37.46.png)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/911/original/Screen_Shot_2015-07-28_at_22.37.46.png)

### SUPPORT

how are you personally subsidizing this work, or how are others
this could be an image of someone at their day job, or your partner cooking for you so that you have more time for the project




### DEPART

an image of where you imagine or know the final work will end up
this could be a landfill, or a recycling bin
