Here, there‚Äôs information on how to post questions on PublicLab.org, and some extra bits on why questions are a great way to get started with community science on PublicLab.org üòÉ Asking or answering a question requires having a PublicLab.org profile. If you don‚Äôt yet have a Public Lab profile, [sign up here for free](/signup).

## Asking a Question

### Tips for posting a question

Anyone who has a Public Lab account can ask and respond to questions on the Public Lab website. As the author of a question, you will be sent an email notification when someone responds. There are many people here who want to help you, but sometimes not every question gets answered. To improve your chances, here are some tips üí°:

1) Before asking a question, **try to search for any similar questions**. You can use the ‚ÄúSearch on Public Lab‚Äù search bar at the top of any page, or try searching for existing questions by topic using the ‚ÄúView questions by topic‚Äù search bar on the [Questions & Answers page](/questions).

<img style="width: 100%; height: 100%" src="https://publiclab.org/i/46788?s=o" alt="Screenshot of the top of the Questions and Answers page, showing two search bars. The search bar on the left says 'Ask a question here' and the search bar on the right says 'View questions by topic'. A blue arrow points to the right search bar and says 'search for questions that have already been posted here'">

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
<p>2) <b>Add tags to indicate what the question is about.</b> <a href="https://publiclab.org/wiki/about-tags">Tags</a> help to categorize your question, help other people to search your question easily, and will enable people who are following those tags to receive an email alert about your question. Tags are shown along with the question title on the Questions page.</p>

The question title is 'Can DIY spectrometers be useful for pH determination and/or dissolved organic carbon of water solution?' Blue badges below the title and author name depict topic tags, including 'spectrometry', 'water-quality', 'question-spectrometry' and 'wastewater'">

3) **Follow topic tags to get notified when a related question is posted.** Questions that are similar to yours might receive an answer that can still help you. You can "Like" any question and receive an email alert when a new answer is added by clicking the button with a star icon at the top right corner of any question post.

4) **All kinds of questions are welcome.** Really! From environmental issues to troubleshooting to finding collaborators‚Äìwe'll help connect your question to other related topics.

### How to post a question on PublicLab.org

<p class="text-center">
<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://publiclab.org/questions/new?title=&tags=question%3Ageneral&template=question&redirect=question">Ask a Question!</a>
</p>

1) Sign into your account at PublicLab.org and go to the [question editor here](https://publiclab.org/questions/new?title=&tags=question%3Ageneral&template=question&redirect=question).

2) Type your question into the ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your question?‚Äù text box at the top. This will be the title of your question post, so something specific and brief will work best.

<img style="width: 90%; height: 90%" src="https://publiclab.org/i/46790?s=o" alt="Screenshot of the title text box on the question editor. Text above the box says 'Ask a question of the Public Lab community' and text in the box says 'What's your question? Be specific'">

3) In the larger middle text box that says ‚ÄúShare some background information‚Äù, add any context that might help readers know more about your question: where you‚Äôre working, what kinds of resources you‚Äôre looking for, or why you‚Äôre interested in this question. You can also add any photos and images, or links that help explain the question. 

4) Add [tags](/wiki/about-tags) to your question in the text box at the bottom. You can use the format `question:insert-your-topic-here` to [make sure your question will show up in topic-related places around the Public Lab website](/wiki/about-tags#Label+special+kinds+of+research+notes). The tag `question:general` is automatically added into the text box; you can choose to keep it, or remove it by clicking on the x in the grey box. The tag `question:water-quality` has been added in the image below as an example.

<img style="width: 90%; height: 90%" src="https://publiclab.org/i/46791?s=o" alt="Screenshot of the tag text box on the question editor. Text in the box says 'type some keywords related to your question', and two tags are already entered into the box. They are represented as grey badges. One says 'question-general' and the other says 'question-water-quality'">

5) Press the ‚ÄúAsk‚Äù button and tada! üéâ You‚Äôve just posted a question! It‚Äôll be visible on the [Questions page here](/questions).

## Answering a Question

Answering questions is another great way to contribute to the Public Lab community. Anyone with a Public Lab account can respond to a question using the "Post Comment" box on the question post.

### If you know an answer to a question, great! If not, there are still ways to help: 

+ Search on the Public Lab website or other sources for answers or ideas, and comment about what you find;
+ Contact people who might be able to offer answers, and share their responses back as comments. Sometimes we do this by emailing people, or posting on social media.

### If you‚Äôre interested in answering questions about a particular topic:

+ Search by topic for questions that have already been posted, using the guidance outlined above in ‚Äú[Tips for posting a question](https://publiclab.org/wiki/public-lab-q-and-a#Tips+for+posting+a+question)‚Äù; 
+ Follow tags like `question:topic-of-interest` to be notified when someone posts a question about your topic of interest. For example, you might follow [`question:water-quality`](/tag/question:water-quality), [`question:infragram`](/tag/question:infragram), or [`question:law-and-policy`](/tag/question:law-and-policy)

<br>

You can find [all questions posted here](/questions). **Of particular help is responding to [unanswered questions](/questions/unanswered/)**, which you can find by going to the Questions & Answers page and clicking on the ‚ÄúUnanswered‚Äù tab near the top.

<img style="width: 100%; height: 100%" src="https://publiclab.org/i/46802?s=o" alt="Screenshot of the unanswered questions section of the questions and answers system. A menu tab that says 'Unanswered' is selected and three cards representing three separate questions are shown below">

## Why Ask or Answer Questions? 

An assorted list of reasons why we love questions: 

+ Environmental issues can be complex, and [breaking down an issue into smaller questions](https://publiclab.org/notes/renee/10-01-2021/creating-research-questions-for-your-community-science-project) is one way to start figuring out how to address the issue;
+ Breaking a problem down into smaller pieces can also help the work feel more manageable; 
+ Answers to questions might lead you to tools or methods that could be used to monitor an issue; 
+ A variety of smaller questions can also enable collaboration by directing specific questions to specific people who might be able to help;
+ All kinds of questions are welcome! Questions about environmental issues, tools, finding resources and collaborators‚Äìwe want to hear it; 
+ If you‚Äôre a newcomer to Public Lab or a particular topic, you have a unique ability to see things that have been overlooked, so we need your ideas!
+ Questions invite people into a conversation and contribute to [building the collective knowledge base at Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/01-27-2017/diagramming-knowledge-production-on-publiclab-org) ‚Äã‚ÄãüöÄ
