###About this project: 
In June 2018, we started scoping a project on stormwater issues in Pensacola. We started by outlining the stormwater problem in Pensacola as we see, and understand it. You can read more about it on our [issue brief here](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/06-19-2018/pensacola-stormwater). 

We then outlined our goals around this issue in an abbreviated goal setting workshop: 

**Goals:** Education and raising awareness about stormwater issues in Pensacola and what people can do about them. 

**Aim:** Reach out to youth and adults through: 

- Creating and distributing an informational pamphlet explaining issues and what people can do, and 
- Hosting events to share the information and engage people on actions to reduce stormwater pollution and flooding. 


### People who are involved

[The Pensacola NAACP](https://www.facebook.com/NAACPPENSACOLA/) 

### What are we working on now:
We have two fronts right now, first we're working on organizing materials for an informational pamphlet on stormwater issues. Those materials are currently being [organized on this page](http://pad.publiclab.org/p/pensacola-stormwater). You can help us by answering the [questions we've posted below](https://publiclab.org/wiki/pensacola-stormwater-project#Questions). 

Second, we're working on organizing a storm drain cleaning event. We've also scoped out other [event ideas compiled on this page](http://pad.publiclab.org/p/pensacola-stormwater-events).
