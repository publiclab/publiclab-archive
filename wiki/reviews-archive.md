## 2021 Research Area Reviews

### December 13-17, 2021: Air Quality Data research area review 

A [summary of the latest research area review on air quality data is here](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/12-21-2021/communicating-air-quality-data-research-area-review-summary), including a list of new data-related resources on the Public Lab website. 

We wrapped up the review with a week of events on communicating air quality data.

#### Presentation & discussion on visualizing and communicating air quality data 

We talked about some basic steps of communicating with air quality data, from **understanding data better to cleaning and organizing data to data stories and visualizations**. We also highlighted new activity posts and wikis on the Public Lab website covering these topics.

After the presentation, @fongvania led an open discussion on air quality monitoring and data. People on the call shared their local concerns with air quality as well as guidance on how to approach some of the challenges with community air monitoring.

#### Presentation on research area review work

**We started the day by presenting the highlight reel from the last three months of collective work and conversations on this topic.** There are new getting-started activities on using maps for advocacy, examples of how maps can be used—for storytelling, understanding a place, as evidence—and more general resources on methods for community organizing and advocacy. Following the presentation, @julia_e_masters facilitated an open discussion where people on the call shared how they’re using mapping in their place-based research and advocacy on environmental health issues.

#### Guest speakers

**Community members working on mapping projects joined us for a guest speaker panel.** This session brought together people from incredible, expansive projects that could have each presented in a dedicated event, so we chose to switch up the usual presentation format and instead do rounds of answering a series of prompts enabling us to see across projects. **Visit the [summary of this session ](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/07-21-2021/summary-of-a-research-area-review-on-mapping-for-organizing-and-advocacy#%F0%9F%97%A3%EF%B8%8F+Mapping+for+organizing:+Guest+speaker+panel)to learn more about each panelist and the questions they answered.**

### March 31, 2021: Soil contamination research area review 

Our latest quarterly deep dive into research areas on Public Lab wrapped up with _two_ public events on community science and [soil contamination](http://publiclab.org/wiki/soil), attended by folx all over the world. 

First, we shared highlights from our research area review on soil contamination, including activities to get started with investigating your soil, an overview of methods for testing and remediating polluted soil, and some next step challenges in tool development. People on the call also shared their questions, reflections, and local concerns on soil contamination. 

[A summary of the research area review on soil contamination is here](https://publiclab.org/notes/bhamster/04-07-2021/wrapping-up-a-research-area-review-on-soil-contamination), including some of the ongoing questions and challenges discussed on the call.
