On call 7/9/12: Josh (Durango- San Juan Citizens Alliance), Shannon and Sara (Public Lab), Megan (RISD)

* Josh: Would like to start something up based on initial April call. Use of Draeger tubes and strips. Is there lab analysis involved in this? 

* Hoping to have Draeger tubes (manually read- change color- % markings for ppms) and photostrips- have to be fixed in dark room (capped on site). Doesn't need to be an actual darkroom. Once fixed, take out and see the different colors on them. Data analysis- distribution curve- match Draeger tubes with photo test strip- what the colors are equal to.

* Distribution of colors to that of Draeger tubes (ex. 40 strips and 8 tubes- semi quantify the two to each other).

* We are testing strips to see how well they work. Goals: can we use combo of test strips and Draeger tubes to get semi-quantifiable reading of H2S source. 

* First step to find a well that we know emits H2S- pattern of concentric circles, see pattern of wind as it is taken from the source based on color in test strips. Produce a method in which a landowner can find out if well on land is a point source- see how much is emitted from each well- pinpoint which well is at issue

* Length of test- this is what we're working on pilot testing. Historically looking at H2S from volcanoes- initially did a test for a week, then for a month (was looking at really low levels)

* Josh- we need to have masks.. need to figure out the best kind to have. In longer term- imagination for test is for landowner that is being exposed to H2S (respirators to recommend- industry standard for this protective gear)

* Swamp gas as opposed to production gas (comes and goes at the wells- heavy one day and less the next day). Might be interesting to leave it out for a month- what it produced over a long period of time, but wouldn't capture spikes- cumulative analysis

* Anyone that would be able to lend us Jerome meter (generally measuring H2S content- has spec. in it, sucks air in- gives digital readout of H2S in air, $10,000 piece of machinery- find one to borrow and test results against it)- air quality division for H2S monitoring- use for landfills for regulatory compliance. No air quality dept. there in Durango. Closest for air quality is in Denver (at least 200 miles away). Might be helpful if we call ahead if there is a connection we can make. Can also look for university researchers, or borrow one and bring it out). Would be nice to survey space w/ Jerome meter- to know things ahead of time, precautionary measures, etc. 

* Should investigate in the next couple of weeks.

* H2S seeps in outcrop- formation that is cold seam- coal bed methane- coal/water/gas- in order to get gas, take water off the coal- formation is shaped like a bowl- they are at northern edge of outcrop- when they started to de-water, released H2S pockets- south, across river from Humane Society- when with the county- posted signs down there- fishing part of river- cautioning people about the release- sometimes really intense, sometimes not- this could be an interesting site to try out. 

* Other locations- from the map that Josh sent round- Nat'l Park or Forest land that can be reliably accessed. BLM land in New Mexico. Would be a good reference point

Timeline

In next two weeks...
Site Identification- take a look at sites- narrow down to 4 candidate sites for investigation (in next 2 weeks) (Josh and Megan)
Safety provisions (Shannon and Sara)
Jerome meter- try to find one (Josh and Sara)- ask Sharon Wilson where she got one from

* Can start with map that Megan sent (http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/sara/5-10-2012/map-new-mexico-natural-gas-wells-new-mexico-and-levels-hydrogen-sulfide). Is it close to Megan or Josh? BLM H2S map. State Park around this area... landowners with sites on property that we could talk to? Other places that we should try? Need easily accessible sites for Josh and San Juan Citizens Alliance (priority). 

* Megan- should spend some time with Mike and Josh to learn about the gas patch- esp. in ind. heavy towns... possibly see if there are landowners that we can work with. 

* Josh will run by Dan to check on his time use. Josh and Megan schedule a follow-up phone call (tomorrow afternoon- 3pmMT). Follow-up call in 2 weeks time- by the 18th? 12MT/1CT/2ET

In next two months... (looking like last two weeks of August is best, could do balloon mapping though in early August)
Investigate sites on foot and possibly balloon map them- Josh and Megan (aerial view of the site)- begin planning a set of experiments at the site- take photos of everywhere containers have been placed- see photographically where each of the test tubes have been placed- data added to the map.

(Josh taking off in early August)

By September...
Doing pilot tests (Josh, Shannon and Sara)

* Josh- to get lat/long of site- can go to Google Earth instead? Balloon will give us time/date stamp and finer resolution, baseline image before we put everything in

* Want to come up with a final workflow- data platform is easy to see and use, how it becomes meaningful, etc. What will the final data presentation be like- readable, performed, etc.

* Megan- week long test with students, look at strips over the course of a weekend, see changes, help to narrow down sites that we want to use, sites where there is activity- set-up background information for S & S coming out and doing more in-depth experiment. Natural H2S seep that could be worked around? Identify a few sites within 3-4 hours of where Megan is in early August while Josh is on vacation- look at reaction over the span of a week
