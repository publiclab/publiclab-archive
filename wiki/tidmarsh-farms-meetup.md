This is the Event Page for Boston's PLOTS Tidmarsh Meet Up

##Nov 17th 2012 Mapping Meetup

There have been a few requests for weekend mapping workshops on the listserv, and so in an effort to create a more active arena for skill sharing and collaboration in the Boston and greater-Boston area, Jeff and I thought it would be fun to organize a meet up -- similar to the recent LEAFEST in Vermont but more informal and for only half of a day.

Our proposal for the first (of hopefully many more) Boston PLOTS meet up is **Saturday, November 17**, 2012 at Tidmarsh Farms in Manomet, MA. We'll have more logistical information soon, but let us know if you're available on November 17 to meet up at Tidmarsh Farms for a skill share/mapping session and potential potluck. Feel free to add your name below.

###Details

**Date:** Saturday, November 17, 2012

**Location:** 137 Bartlett Road, Manomet, MA 02152 ([TidmarshFarms.com](http://tidmarshfarms.com)) - [Google Maps](http://goo.gl/maps/K3lEp)

**Time:** 12PM until there's no more wind, we run out of helium or we get hungry

**Contact:** email "plots-boston@googlegroup.com" or call/text Jeff's cell at 415 508 6769 or Jen's cell at 978-302-7908.

Note: we'll be meeting at noon at **137 Bartlett Road** -- the proper address should be 139 but 137 is easier to see. The meet up point is a grey industrial barn that does not have a number.
