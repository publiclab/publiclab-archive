Updated info, March 11, 2012:
The meetup is still on for 2:30PM on UT's Campus, unless otherwise noted. Let's hope for some sunshine! 

However, our rain date for the aerial mapping meetup is 3/12. If you're still interested and/or available to join us for the rain date, let us know and we'll keep you in the loop.

Updated info, March 8, 2012:
As part of Public Lab's March Mapping Madness, a few of us plan to host an aerial mapping meet up on Sunday, March 11th from 2:30PM to 4:00PM on the corner of East Campus Drive and 23rd Street on UT's Campus. It will be held shortly after Public Lab's SXSW Panel at the AT&T Conference Center at 12:30PM. This will be a great opportunity to test-drive balloon and/or kite mapping. And if you're already familiar with aerial mapping, bring your experience because there will be room for collaboration. 

We updated the Public Lab wiki page for Austin, so feel free to add your name if you or anyone you know wants to join us. My cell is 978-302-7908, but I'm just as easy to get in contact via email. I've additionally cced the entire SXSW panel, as we'll be working together to facilitate the meet up.
