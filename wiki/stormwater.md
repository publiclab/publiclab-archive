Stormwater is excess runoff from rain and snowmelt events that flows over land or impervious surfaces, such as paved streets, parking lots, and building rooftops, and does not soak into the ground. 
  
Some of the concerns around stormwater are that "the runoff picks up pollutants like trash, chemicals, oils, and dirt/sediment that can harm our rivers, streams, lakes, and coastal waters" -- and human health.

### How is stormwater regulated? 

Stormwater is one of the pollutants that is regulated under the [National Pollution Discharge Elimination System](https://www.epa.gov/npdes) (NPDES). "The NPDES stormwater program regulates some stormwater discharges from three potential sources: municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s), construction activities, and industrial activities." 

### How is stormwater monitored? 

Monitoring for stormwater can be challenging. Monitoring activities could explore facets of stormwater such as:

- The depth and duration of standing water in an area,
- How much rainwater can be harvested from an area, 
- How much water can be absorbed by an area,
- How different ground covers react to stormwater events, and 
- How well infrastructure is working to handle stormwater runoff.
