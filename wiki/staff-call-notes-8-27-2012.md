###Questions###
* Kickstarter search not optimized ? http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/makerhaus/open-spectrometer?ref=live
  * because of “spectrometer” vs “spectrometry” in title
* Facebook connect? https://www.facebook.com/PublicLab
  * shannon’s account? Liz offers... dunno if you can undo connecting it...
  * need individual account, doesn’t exist for PLOTS.
  * it’s asking for hometown, interests... i think this is really supposed to be jeff’s account, so skipping
* Press release?
  * write a draft, share?
* indoor floor plans of Pfizer in mapknitter, like Macy’s?

###Newsletter suggestions###
* Balloon mapping efforts to find a Revolutionary War era mass grave in the Gowanus subwatershed included in NYTimes article cc/ Eymund Diegel: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/nyregion/historian-points-to-gowanus-brooklyn-lot-as-grave-of-first-maryland-regiment.html?_r=3&pagewanted=all
  *** another interesting case of historical mapping-- strong use case ***Annotation/Overlay***
* kickstarter: http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/8-27-2012/diy-spectrometer-kickstarter-launched 
* Atlantic article http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2012/08/future-aerial-mapmaking-cheap-helium-balloons/3108/
* last day to vote...
* Annotated maps layer dev: https://github.com/jywarren/plots/issues/131 
  * worthwhile to tag all historic maps with “historic” in MapKnitter and post a gallery of them?
* Flurry of indoor floor plans georeferenced on MapKnitter -- might signal interesting things to come!
