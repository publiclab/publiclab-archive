###Public Archive###

* Backups:
  * add the plots backup script to drndl cron
  * stewart: ask about keeping copies of raw data in CA, actually just copies of all phases
    * order another TB drive -- talk to Shannon, use Gulf Coast debit card
* PDF what needs to be done?
  * data entry sheet/page
  * maps page - overview map, then embedded viewer instead of thumbnail
  * create records for all maps
* Jeff: focus on final poster, layout, and actual printing done
* add gdal commands info to wiki page, to document our gdal processes: http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/gdal-commands
* GDAL: can we make a GeoTiff without using gdalwarp? add to gdal_translate, or just ping Mike Migurski?
  * http://archive.publiclaboratory.org/gulf-coast/2011-2-25-louisiana-violet/tms/googlemaps.html
* lots of obliques stitches, what to do with them?
  * obliques displayed in Flickr, but linked to and displayed in Maps database
  * obliques stored (backed up) in the archive directories for their respective sites

###Collaborations###

* Hunter, timelapse work?

###Field work this week###

* Barataria Bay monitoring with LUMCON
* Grand Isle - birds! A test for the Salt Lake project.

###PLOTS website###

* Added a Licenses page: http://publiclaboratory.org/licenses

###Misc###

* online mapping party? learn to stitch?
  * or just a real-world “party” to stitch a map *quickly* after it’s made. Maybe the same people as collected the images but not necessarily
