###Having trouble registering?

We have had problems with scripts, programs, and robots signing up onto the PublicLab.org website. To prevent scripts from signing up, we have added a test to the signup page, which looks like this:

[![Screenshot_2016-03-17_at_4.21.24_PM.png](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/137/medium/Screenshot_2016-03-17_at_4.21.24_PM.png)](//i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/015/137/original/Screenshot_2016-03-17_at_4.21.24_PM.png)

If you get an error that looks like this:

> Spam detection -- It doesn't seem like you are a real person! If you disagree, read more here: http://publiclab.org/wiki/registration-test

The error message you are seeing is generated because you did not fill out the test correctly, and the website thinks you are a robot. There are four pairs of sentences. One sentence in each pair is something a robot might say, the other sentence in each pair is something a human might say. In the screenshot above, we have selected the answers which represent what a human would say.

Please let us know at **web@publiclab.org** if you are still having problems, or if you have ideas about how to make this more clear for other users.
