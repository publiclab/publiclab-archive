###Finalizing Retail Report (July 2011 - June 20 2012)

* Need: 1) Total profit margin from Breadpig reports (from last 4 months to bring it up to date); 2) 
* Sales sums (sheet #3): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlY4Tg28DhosdHdUS3lpN1Njdzh1QW81M1lqNWplY3c#gid=4 is updated thru June 20, need through 
* Total FY2011-12 - Balloon kits sold: 175 earned: $15,945.00

###Finalizing Web Report -- DONE

###Staff meeting and barn raising

* share-- how to leverage volunteers locally and at a distance
  * ethics of participation
  * designing workshop documents for distant and local participation
  * community involvement and design
  * Barnraising e-mail list-- take over 2011 barnraising group

### Mat’s ideas for retail

* Kickstarters are hard to manage, so let’s do an independant push via store for holiday. Look at making a retail store on a breakout page that is slightly separated by Breadpig. Perhaps work with different fulfillment company, especially T-Shirts. 
*Grassroots Mapping Forum Subscriptions-- 250 members in order to do bulk mailing. Issue with Amplifier, 1000 makes it sustainable. fulfillment -- their link to subscribe wasn’t working for weeks. 
* organizers issue:
  * ideas: can we get CIEL to talk about legal outcomes?
  * contact organizers...
* Membership

###Thermal Flashlight potential Kickstarter (generally Kickstarters help us make 1/3rd “public support”, but how not to burn out kickstarter as a platform....)

*  seasonally appropriate
* grow the community
* get us to solidify a kit
* general fundraising

* Thermal flashlight
* NIRKIT/NIRCAM
* Balloon and kite kits v. 2.0 + Oil Spill Response kit
