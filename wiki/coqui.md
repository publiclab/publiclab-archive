## What Does It Do?

**The Coqui: a simple device to read a sensor via an audible tone.** We're exploring using audio frequencies to convey sensor readings -- like a modem, but even simpler -- in order to make sensor readings more accessible for people (or to enable data transmission over ubiquitous audio jacks on PCs and smartphones). 

## Latest version

The [latest and simplest version of the Coqui](/notes/warren/03-01-2019/build-a-sound-generating-coqui-conductivity-sensor) can be seen in the following images. This version differs from [the previous](/notes/ashkaya/09-17-2016/build-a-coqui-a-simple-water-conductivity-sensor) in a few ways:
 
* smaller, cheaper circuitboard (breadboard)
* fewer wires
* flatter wires which make it easier to see the circuit

However, the circuit is fundamentally the same! Click these images to enlarge:

A Coqui is a simple, inexpensive, open source device that generates an audible tone that is based on any electric resistance-based measurement. For example, a Coqui can measure:

* conductivity of liquids
* temperature
* ambient light

## Build a Coqui

Instructions on the breadboard-based "BBv1.0" edition of the Coqui can be found here:

### Notes

- The github repo for a more permanent printed circuit board version of the coqui is [here](https://github.com/OpenWaterProject/coqui)

The Coqu&iacute; is a circuit that allows you to 'hear' the readings from various sensors.  Once the Coqu&iacute; is assembled, you'll be able to 'hear' the conductivity of a solution, the temperature of a room, or the color of a pH test strip. </br></br>

The design was named (onomatopeically) after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coqu%C3%AD">several species of small frogs </a> which have a loud, distinctive call at night.</br></br>

## Parts list

See the initial parts list here: #13459 and #11209 for a DigiKey shopping cart link at $19 per kit. And @kanarinka mentions:

> there are a couple other things that are helpful to have that are not shown (like the probe made from the top of a water bottle with two screws in it and alligator clips to attach that to the breadboard)
