KnowFlow is designed for environmental activists who wants to monitor water quality and get real time data. Now it can monitor 5 parameters: **Temperature, pH, ORP, Electronic conductivities, Dissolved Oxygen**.
It is based on Arduino, easy to change and add more sensors and modules. Currently it stores the data on a micro SD card, also the data can be read on phone by bluetooth (except for Dissolved Oxygen). 

Most of the sensor used are from [DFRobot](https://www.dfrobot.com) and [Atlas Scientific](https://www.atlas-scientific.com), which are the main 2 sensor suppliers for Arduino users.
