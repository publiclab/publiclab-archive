##What we're working on##
- Writing up a mapping protocol- data chain of custody for mapping so that maps can be used as an official record;
- Documenting kite and balloon flying from boats so that people can get comfortable with this;
- Tutorials, workshop models and curriculum;
- Outreach and advocacy guides;
- Safety protocols- with Public Lab equipment and around oil;
- Describe concept of "toolkits" more fully so it can be modeled for other toolkits
