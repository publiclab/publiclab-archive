New Orleans, LA

My partner and I are doing our project at our school Science and Mathematics in New Orleans.

My partner and I goal is to find a certified way of getting rid of cats-claw plants or vines. Our motivation for this project, is knowing that all New Orleans residents have cats-claw plants covering almost half of their homes.

Me and my partner are concerned about cats-claw vines, because we are afraid that possibly one day all the homes in New Orleans will be covered completely in cats-claw plants.

Our teacher Ms. Mallozzi, a public lab member MiMi, and myself (Savannah Morris) and my partner Jamaica Morgan.

Recently, my partner and I have pulled some cats-claw vines. We have put them into a tray to see if they'll grow on the three different pieces of wood we have in the tray. One piece of wood is plain, One piece of wood as regular paint on it, and One piece of wood as a mixture of vine spray and paint.
