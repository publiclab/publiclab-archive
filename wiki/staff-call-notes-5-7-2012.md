    * Public Lab monetary commitments -- June: $0, July: $0, Aug: $250, Sept: $250, Oct: $250, etc for potentially a long term lease, 5 year or 10 year. I have approached 596acres.org to join us, as well as citizensensor.cc, and circled back with GenSpace to see if they had any individuals from their community who are interested in branching out from the MEx space in downtown BK. Continuing to curate the space by filling it with folks and orgs with open research for social and environmental missions.
