Reagents are a type of chemical which react to a specific compound, typically changing color or opacity when that compound is present. Usually, you add a few drops of a reactive chemical into a container of your sample, and look for a color change. Some reagents are dried onto flat strips or put inside glass tubes (for air testing).
