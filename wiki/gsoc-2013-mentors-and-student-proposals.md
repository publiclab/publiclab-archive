Students we missed out on (didn't respond to their inquiries or otherwise didn't submit a proposal):


**Nishith Maheshwari** (nshthm@gmail.com)

    ...currently pursuing my degree in an integrated program of Btech in Computer Science+ MS by research in the field of Spatial Informatics at IIIT Hyderabad, India.
    I have had experience in analyzing remote sensing data and have used the GDAL libraries in different projects during my course-work. Also I have a good experience in using JavaScript in another course project.
    Due to my past experience in handling remote sensing data I am interested in a project of same area. 
    I had a few questions :
    1. Is this project supposed to be an independent application or an add-on to an existing project?
    2. Where can I find some test cases of the data which is supposed to be processed by this utility?

**Cristian Ichimescu** (c.ichimescu@gmail.com)

    I would like to know more details about these projects: Adapt Android video interface and Android Aerial Acquisition App.
    Also can you provide the source code for the android Video class that needs to be adapted. 

**Bharat Bhushan** (bhmn12345@gmail.com)

    I am interested in multiple project ideas mentioned in the infrared projects sections. Some of my queries are:
    i). Do i need to acquire the stereo-camera hardware before jumping further into development.
    ii). Are there any issues for the "infrared-visible video toolkit" that i can patch for my application? 
    iii). I haven't noticed anyone idling on the IRC channel or the google groups with reference to GSOC , so i hope the mail is the best way to contact you.
    Python can be used with Django framework and SimpleCv/ PIL/ ImageMagick etc. for this purpose. I don't have a lot of experience in python for image composting, though i have worked on Fiji(ImageJ) for classification of NDVI and hyperspectral satellite images into multiple classes using SVM. 
    I went through the https://github.com/dwblair/irkit code , and that sure can be reused for the web interface.
    I also wish to work on the alignment and analysis of overlapping visible and NIR images, though i don't have much experience in the optimization of image alignment algorithms. I have familiarity with remote sensing, i have worked on ERDAS and ENVI software, and created a digital map of our university by stitching together around ~4000 aerial photos.
