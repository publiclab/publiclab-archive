This page includes information about observable permit violations of the frac [sand mining industry](https://publiclab.org/wiki/nonmetallicmining#Industrial+Sand+Mining) related to transportation. 

###About Transportation and Frac Sand Mining 

The frac sand mining industry uses various forms of transportation including dump trucks, semi's, railroad cars, and conveyors. Regulations may vary from county to county; some are regulated by state law; in terms of railroad regulations, some companies using short lines are more locally regulated while federal laws apply to rail companies that travel interstate. Fugitive dust from conveyors may be a problem; seldom does the DNR regulate fugitive dust whereas the State Patrol has control of dust emissions from vehicular traffic. Towns can also pass ordinances to regulate their use of town roads by mining companies. These can include ordinances to govern truck routes, establish hours of operation, set other limits on trucking and hauling sand and materials (such as weight limits and requiring tarping loads), etc. These protections can be found in Wis. Stats. §§ 349.16 & 349.17.


###What can be reported:

- A truck transporting frac sand material that is stopped:
   - In an intersection
   - On a crosswalk
   - In a safety zone 
   - Within 25ft of the nearest rail at a railroad crossing
- A vehicle or train hauling material from a mine that does not adequately prevent its contents from dropping, sifting, leaking or otherwise escaping.
- A train, locomotive or car that stops at a highway or street crossing longer than 10 minutes.

###Helpful information to collect for reporting:

- Photos
- The name of the company who owns/operates the vehicle
- License plate number and other identifiable information
