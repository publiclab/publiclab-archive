**/Requests**

Public Lab is always looking for support. There are things you can come and do "one of," but there are other opportunities to get more involved activities that help build out resources and support the community regularly. Read more about these opportunities below: 

- **[Assist in a Research Area Review](https://publiclab.org/wiki/sandbox-comdev#Assist+in+a+Research+Area+Review)**
- **[Help with Questions and New Environmental Concerns](https://publiclab.org/wiki/sandbox-comdev#Help+with+Questions)**
- **[Support the Community](https://publiclab.org/wiki/sandbox-comdev#Support+the+Community)**


## Assist in a Research Area Review

Research area reviews are ways we work to organize and synthesize information and materials on Public Lab based on topic areas. _We are testing out a new way to do this._ Currently, Research Area Reviews are run in three phases: 

   - Phase 1: Information Gathering
   - Phase 2: Conveining
   - Phase 3: Synthesizing 

#### Current Research Area Review:  Pipelines
Phase 1: May 15th- June 15th 2015

**Phase 1 Activities:**

##Help with Questions and New Environmental Concerns

People often show up to the Public Lab community with questions about environmental issues. We could use help answering them! 

- [Help answer recent questions](https://publiclab.org/questions/unanswered/)
- Subscribe to answer questions on a topic
- Newcomers who are concerned about environmental issues often post "[Issue Briefs](www.publiclab.org/wiki/issue-brief)" as their first contribution to Public Lab about their concern. Follow the tag "issue-brief" to get alerts when new ones are posted. To support these new contributors, you can help to:
   - Tag their material if it's not tagged, 
   - Ask supportive questions to help them flesh out their concern 
   - Post ideas on next steps the group could consider exploring under their issue.


## Support the Community

There are others ways and working groups to be apart of to support the Public Lab community, below are some of the more active ways to get involved! 

- **[Software Development](https://publiclab.org/wiki/software-outreach)** The Public Lab website and others it supports are built open source online through our code contributor community. Learn more about how to get involved on the Software Outreach page!
- **[The Moderation Working Group](https://publiclab.org/wiki/moderation#Become+a+moderator)** helps to make sure that spam is off the website! This group does an important and simple task that keeps Public Lab clean of ads! 
- **Facilitation**: The Public Lab community is always looking for help with facilitation. You can learn some of the facilitation techniques [on this page](www.publiclab.org/facilitation). Specifically, we seek support in helping to direct research area reviews, hosting OpenHour and OpenCall, assisting with in person events, and helping people who need assistance to publish and share materials on Public Lab. If you're interested in becoming a facilitator supporting the Public Lab community email stevie@publiclab.org.
