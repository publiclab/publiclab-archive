_All 7 core staff present_

Friday, November 18, 2011

###Collaborations###

* planning for EcoHackNYC part deux, maybe weekend of April 20-21, 2012?
  * Partners: Vizzuality, UNEP bioinformatics. additions: NYU ITP, NatGeo, some part of NASA (Lela Prashad + JD Godcheaux, NiJeL), also AMNH Center for Biodiversity (already working with them)
  * Goal: to bring open source hardware hacking and “going outside” to the really great data viz event from 
    * Should this event be a  pattern for others?  not overly connected to place.
  * November 15. Also -- should connect with CIRES.
  * soliciting comments from all PLOTS folks? Do we have a large data set to present them with? what about a visualization for open hardware development (grids of development paths?)
  * software ideas: auto-sorting MapMill.org, https://github.com/jywarren/clashifier (teaching it to classify, currently doesn’t work, but is architected, can be used to spot oil)
  * if hardware is involved, or if hardware environmental investigators need field time before they come into a hackathon. devices that work, and you can get data, but still need tweaking. 
  * additional wacky idea for city-wide, or multi-city atmospheric chemistry and physical sensors “balloons over the city”. Could get funding. inquiries out to NASA, CIRES
  ** http://www.instructables.com/id/Air-quality-balloons/
* collaboration with Dontflush.me? 

###Recent & Upcoming events###

###Fundraising###

* Semi-urgent fundraising PLOTS overview doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wxmu3RFbvM3kkR7OUlHeDpvrNYocMt20ih0mMJYa4JU/edit?hl=en_US 
* NSF in progress: 
  * ideas for categories of environmental health at home, in the community, for sustainable futures. 
  * Which sites will we do research with? dramatically narrowing the idea of what a site is, or chapter: it could be anyone who wants to use the tools and contribute. instead, “we will establish 6 centers that will provide resources to the community.”  asking for resources to support existing sites / research communities with materials and equipment. “Service Stations”
* by Matt: environmental taxidermy (ground permeated by arsenic, with thin veneer of “life” spread on top, sites being treated as a visual object). How to work on sites as a full living being? Evil Caneevil is actually from Butte, and that is a model of actually how people relate to hazardous environments, by dirt bike jumping over. at least this is actual relationship to site, verses “dead-zone” parks. Relate formaldehyde, and the roomba platform. Could we produce a campaign object (inflatable rat), or parade float? 
  * Next Steps? IdeaLab for PBS blog. Thanks for keeping us weird. 
* Kickstarter: standard markups for retail// kickstarter details (video going out monday)
  * needs workshop pictures and video, general input. Adam and Sara voiceover. 

###Retail###

* Shirts, later spectrometers (first couple sold/shipped)
  * need standard markup. 40% markup, 15% for subsidized kits, 15% for R&D, 10% for growth of retail fund.
  * sparkfun elelectronics does 40%
  * what is shrinkage (unsellable hw) for our retail products? don’t know.... 
  * Donated warehousing by BreadPig Assemblizer
