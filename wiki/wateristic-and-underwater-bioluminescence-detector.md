### Location

I'm working on this in New Orleans. Maritime shipping is a huge industry here and we're hoping that this sensor can make it safer. This can be used by boaters in these locations: 

 - Mississippi River 
 - Lake Ponchatrain 
 - Gulf of Mexico 

### Goals and Motivations

Our goal is to make a underwater sensor that can detect bioluminescence. Concerned about safety of shipping and want to develop an interesting way to view the ocean.  

### People who are involved

@omarion, @jguillen055_stu, @mimiss, and @amallozzi are working on this

### What are we working on now:

We are just getting started. We're working to develop a sensor. First steps include:
 - Decide parts
 - Develop code
 - Build it
 - Create a way to test it
