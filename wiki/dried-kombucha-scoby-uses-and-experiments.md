This is the main page for any research and experiments done with dried Kombucha SCOBY.

##About 
A Kombucha SCOBY is a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast created as a byproduct of fermenting black tea and sugar. When dried the culture becomes harder and stronger, resembling something like leather.   Because it is still alive, just dormant, you can join two edges of the material by wetting the two edges with sugar water and having them grow into each other. 

As of now there has been little to no research on potential applications of the material.  Fashion designer Suzanne Lee has used this leathery substance to create clothing. [1] However the material fails in many cases when treated like a textile. Mostly because of its willingness to absord and become slimy when in contact with water or sweat. 

##Potential Uses 
* Lampshade.
* Container for electronics projects.
