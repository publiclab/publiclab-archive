## Planning

Interested in being a part of it?  Here's how!

**Run a workshop.**  Workshops are food for the brain, body, or soul, and can be on anything from screenprinting to Standing Rock, decompression strategies to anti-displacement.  What do you want to learn?  What do you want to share?

**Build a cohort.**   This is an opportunity for us to strengthen our collaboration muscles and build a cohort of people -- Somervillians, artists, old timers, crafty folks, educators, hipsters, and activists of all stripes -- to reach across boundaries and help to lift each other up.  

**Intergenerational.**  If you've been around the block and have seen all this a million times -- or if you're just-recently-not-a-kid and are terrified out of your mind - we want your perspective and your voice.  CITS, Full Circle cohort, youth leaders, and youth organizers:  you especially are invited!

**Somerville local** (and Cambridge, and Medford, and Arlington, you too!) Occupation, privatization, state-sanctioned violence, displacement, and disruption of everyday life:  Trump didn't invent these things.  Likewise, strategies for creative resistance, non-engagement, and grassroots solution have been happening right here at home for decades.

## Sessions

We're looking for people to organize sessions for the day, from one to two hours each. We're hoping to have a session of each of these types running at a time:

* 1 crafts-oriented
* 1 "learn about this"
* 1 brainstorm-oriented
* downtime -- for "taking a break"
* 1 for young people (various ages)
* accessible to teens, best facilitated by teens (any good workshop should be accessible)
