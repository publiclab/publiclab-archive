# UNICEF Rio Proposal

##Summary##

UNICEF is proposing a large youth environmental risk mapping project... for the 2012 Rio+20 Earth Summit. 12 month, 125 participant, and though we proposed balloon mapping with our existing local contacts, Joe seems to be proposing a GPS cellphone based approach. We can make additional suggestions of using rectified paper mapping, but this seems unresolved and we need to find out the following:

* what our involvement is overall- in the proposal it seems there are multiple groups?
* what the timeline is
* what areas we will be working in (5 different neighborhoods/sites?)
* what our involvement pre and post project is expected to be
* ages of the youth we are working with
* It sounds like there are a couple simultaneous mapping projects- are we proposed to do both or working with another org?
* Who are the local partners
* We have GM community members in Brazil and would like to get them involved in the short or long term- what long-term role could UNICEF see them having?
* What are the long-term goals of the project? What are the outcomes for the youth involved?
* Rio+20 - do we then have involvement in this?
* details of contracting if we aren't a 501c3?

##Upcoming##

* meeting with Joe Agoada about our potential role in this project
