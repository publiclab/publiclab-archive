###What is a Public Lab Barnraising?

[Public Lab Barnraisings](/wiki/barnraising) are the closest thing we have to a Public Lab conference -- but with an emphasis on "doing stuff together" rather than just presenting/talking. In the spirit of bringing a community together to collectively raise a structure such as a barn, Public Lab comes together to develop tools, toolkits, supporting materials such as guides and tutorials, test the tools and develop new research directions and projects. Participants represent a wide range of interests from technologists and designers to social """scientists""" and community organizers. The annual Fall Barnraising is held in Louisiana each year. In 2014, we’ve introducing a second Spring Barnraising into our event schedule. The Spring Barnraisings will be in different locations each year and focus on specific environmental issues or tool development projects.

###What was the 2014 Tool-focused Barnraising?

The 2014 tool-focused Barnraising was a regional version of a Public Lab Barnraising and was held in Kington and Plymouth, Massachusetts. The Barnraising was a 2.5 day conference for 25-30 individuals from Public Lab’s Northeast community, including representatives from local environmental justice organizations that are interested in incorporating community science into their programs. Together, the attendees engaged in discussions, research and tool development around environmental justice issues of water quality through unconference sessions.
