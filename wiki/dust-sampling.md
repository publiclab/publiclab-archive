Dust sampling can be done with a filter, a sticky pad, or other techniques, and can help in assessing particulate air pollution (#pm or #dust) -- see https://publiclab.org/wiki/pm for more.

This is also a helpful prerequisite step for viewing particulate pollution through a microscope, if it's big enough to be seen!
