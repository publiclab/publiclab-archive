### Summary

[CivicLab][] has been invited to apply to host a [Chicago Ideas Week Lab](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LtG25N6QmRZQELXCpQZ34G9xQtRdAnCQ3R_IFygDzSI/viewform) to take place between October 13-19, 2014.  We think that something involving citizen science would be novel in Chicago and make a great hands on activity.  It could also be a good way to get more people involved in the recently started [Public Lab Chicago Chapter](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/public-lab-chicago), and hopefully in the specific projects people are crafting there.  This is a space to flesh out a proposal.

In addition to editing this page, you can join the conversation thread at the[Public Lab Chicago GoogleGroup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/public-lab-chicago/jmNHQag6kkg)

Note: you do not need to be invited to apply (wink).

###Partners  


1. [CivicLab][]
    - Benjamin Sugar
2. [Rising Tide Chicago][]
    - Joy Holowiki
3. Your organization
    - and/or you here!

###Constraint Hypotheses  


1. Whiting is probably too far as is the 30 minute drive to 10730 South Burley (that's the address right?).  At 18 minutes, 25 E 100th St. (again, do I have that correct?) is a possibility but traffic is never ideal and that could easily turn into 30.  Add in time to setup, and I think we'll be pretty crunched and have a watered down version.

2. We should meet at [CivicLab][].  Even if we had an off-site which was closer, while we would save time by meeting at the site, we'd also have to have a rain plan which might confuse people and lower our attendance. 

    The other benefit is that this will give Joy the opportunity to talk about Rising Tide Chicago [RTC][] the issues you're working on, and how you're approaching it with the PL kits.  Hopefully this will generate interest both in the issue but also in out [RTC][]!  This could be done in the field but meeting at [CivicLab][] gives [RTC][] the ability to use images instead of just talking while we stand in the field.

###Ideas  


1. Meet at [CivicLab][], have [RTC][] presentation, then balloon map either right outside the lab, or walk to union park and map the park.  Rain plan, spectrometry.

2. [RTC][] brings samples to the lab from a site which we analyze with the DIY spectrometers.

3. We have a Public Lab [Discotech](http://www.alliedmedia.org/news/2014/02/27/discotech-model-spreads-worldwide) (Discovering Technology) in a fair like environment).  People who want to go mapping, go.  People who want to spectromet-atize stay. People can also do infragrams.  Rain plan, 100% no mapping.

4. More ideas please! [Nom nom nom nom nom](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nom%20nom%20nom).
