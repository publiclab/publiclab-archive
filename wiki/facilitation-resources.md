The [Environmental Leadership Program](http://elpnet.org/) facilitation working group is using this page to compile facilitation resources, but welcome others to contribute and utilize the listed resources!

Notes: Wrote the book, "http://www.communityatwork.com/book.html"</br>

Notes: Written by a mentor of Michael Gagne's, George Lakey, Michael says, "is one of the most amazing facilitators and educators I've seen. George's approach - known as "direct education" -  builds on a bunch of facilitation and adult education methodologies including popular education, pedagogy and theater of the oppressed, process work approaches (including World Work), Quaker decision-making (also known as corporate discernment), and more. It is also informed by - and deeply connected to - his 6 decades of experience as an organizer, campaigner, and trainer in social movements around the world. Though it has been positively enriched by George's experiences as a working class, queer man and through his international and cross-cultural work - it has also benefitted greatly by being used, facilitated, and fleshed out by women, youth, and/or people of color.

**Resource: Liberating Structures**</br>

Notes: "They are fully described (outcomes, tools needed, time allotted, how to describe it to people), free to use, and range from simple to complex. I've used most of them and they are amazing. My favorites are 1-2-4-all, 15% solutions, Min Specs, TRIZ, Ecocycle, AI, Impromptu Networking, 25/10 crowdsourcing, What/So What/ Now What. TRIZ is mind-blowing to do with a planning group instead of visioning. I bought the book and it has more in-depth suggestions, including 'strings'  of facilitation tools that achieve certain outcomes, but the free information available on the site is good enough for basic work. I am constantly turning to this list of tools and the book when I'm called upon to facilitate input sessions or discussions."

**Resource: Technology of Participation (ToP)**</br>

Notes: "The tools are solid, though the quality of the training itself can vary by trainer. It's worthwhile to get the tools, though. I've seen and used their ""Consensus Workshop"" with some regularity and it's incredibly helpful for filtering a lot of disparate ideas into workable nuggets."" ALSO, ""I can second Hanna's note about Technology of Participation (ToP) and offer my experience with this training & facilitation tools. It's a very thoughtful system of tools and processes used for difficult conversations, arriving at consensus and planning for action. It's
focused on engagement and inclusion of all levels of a hierarchy and provide methods to create a conducive environment for participants. Rare has used this system for many years in the field and has had great success with it. Their 3 day introductory course in Minneapolis (MToP) offered a hands on training experience, the course was facilitated using these methods and there was a lot of opportunity for practice. They have a number of more in-depth trainings and even virtual tools. I'd highly recommend the Minnesota chapter of ToP led by trainer Linda Alton and her team (she was awesome, highly recommend!).

**Resource: The Facilitator's Guide to Participatory Decision Making**</br>
Link: http://www.communityatwork.com/book.html</br>
Notes: "They offer trainings mostly on the west coast, but they can also do custom trainings if you set it up (I know someone who had them come to Boston and train their entire staff team). They also offer a 5-day organizational diagnosis training that is outstanding."

**Resource: Workshop Planning Template**</br>

Notes: "Good workshop planning is key when facilitating workshops, trainings and events.
 
Often details of your workshop planning might be scattered across several mediums but this canvas brings it all together in a workshop planning template.
 
Importantly it helps you think holistically about the details of your workshop covering the 6 P's of Workshop Preparation."
