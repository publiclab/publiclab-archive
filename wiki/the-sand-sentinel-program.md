The Sand Sentinel Program is aimed at creating an easier way for people to collect and file reports on suspected permit violations by frac sand mining companies. 

###Background
Due to its use in fracking, the [frac sand mining](https://publiclab.org/wiki/nonmetallicmining) industry has been plaguing communities in western Wisconsin for many years. In September 2018, a number of people from around the Midwest who are fighting frac sand mining issues hosted check-in meetings on how things were going, sharing notes on some projects to date and ideas on pathways forward people were seeing that were new, or could use some more attention (see notes [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/09-04-2018/recent-conversations-on-the-frac-sand-issue) and [here](https://publiclab.org/notes/stevie/09-14-2018/notes-from-tuesday-s-frac-sand-call)). The Sentinel Program, originally conceived of by @Pat was highlighted as an opportunity. 

### Goals

The goals of this project are to make frac sand mining industry violations easier for people to spot and understand, and to increase accountability and transparency in reporting.
