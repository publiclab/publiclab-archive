Questions for Env. Estrogen Screen / Home Testing for Endocrine Disruptors


Goal for month: contact DIY-Bio community, start growing yeast,  video, why yeast, bio-monitoring generally/methodologically, what kind of data does this produce? Sketches about how the yeast work. 
Proposed goal for three months: Come up with Hello World
Proposed goal for six months: build community of expert participants
Proposed over all goal for year: try in a home

###History/context of tool###

* what inspired it? “to test sources of water for the presence of environmental estrogens” (tool page)
  * who (all) designed/developed/tested it? Where? (PLOTS Toxics and Health working group, with Joan Ruderman/Harvard University, Gary Wessel/Brown University, Jean Huang/Olin College, Yuyu Chen, Mara Strenberg, Avery Louie, and Sara Wylie.)
  * where has it been used and how did it go? - “We are currently in the earliest stage of development on this tool.” (tool page) in the New England Research Center
  * how specialized is demand for the tool? - broad- any home
  * opportunities for sponsorship or major partnership? unable to be determined

###Replicability###

* documentation, transmission to new users - early stage
* tools needed? - early stage, unknown. hello world test?
* skills needed? - what knowledge does it assume? difficulty? - early stage, unknown
* materials needed - supply chain limitations- early stage, unknown. (Level 1 Bio lab req. not listed) 
* safety- early stage, unknown but seems like handling circuitry could be dangerous

###Development###

* what is it costing us in staff hours? 
* what is it costing in materials? - early stage, unknown

###Maintenance###

* what are the per-use costs? - early stage, unknown
* what are wearing parts? (frequency of replacement) - early stage, unknown

###Accessibility/legibility###

* are there opportunities for people to participate/contribute
* formats: online/offline? - early stage, unknown 
* cost? (dollars, time) - early stage, unknown
* access to materials, components - early stage, unknown
* language barrier? - early stage N/A
* language: domain-specific, insider/outsider - early stage

###Change effected###

* how has it measurably/materially affected:
  * local ecology - early stage N/A
  * available/actionable information? - early stage N/A
  * decision making - early stage N/A
  * legal, policy, regulatory - early stage N/A
  * enables participation in a formerly closed information loop - early stage (inspiring interest as an idea)

###Future:###

2012 tool goals:

* Post photos/media about other similar tests/setups
* Post photographs, documentation of a prototype or experimental setup
  * concepts for designing home testing kits, protocols for sample prep (listed on tool page)
* develop container (based on glass prototypes) for the culturing the yeast with the sample
* attempt cost, materials list estimates (ballpark)
* identify a “hello world” - a first, easy “successful” use of the tool which others should try to replicate
  * make guide for growing your own yeast?
* figure out what form the data will take, and how it will be shared, 
  * “glowing or turning blue” -- what does it look like, what does each mean?
* (for any home tool) issues with privacy on sharing data on personal residences
* plan events around to-dos, like sample preparation, developing experimental setups, attempting a similar test for feasibility
  * Hand sketch diagram of a “biological circuit” (a term that is entirely new to me, BTW)?
  * storyboard “the process would take W days, be affordable for X, would reveal Y information which would lead to Z actions”
