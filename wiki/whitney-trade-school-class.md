###Send by Wed. March 9th###

* A detailed list of materials/equipment you need to teach your class.  (ie. chairs, video projector, clipboards/something for your student to write on, extension cords, lighting etc).
  * You don't need to list the specialized materials/equipment unique for your class (ie sugar, broken cd roms) We expect you will bring those materials for your class.
* General Materials equipment you already have to teach you class. (ie. power strips)
  * The more independent you can be to provide your own materials/equipment the better. We will make every effort to provide you with the materials and equipment that you do not have but need (ie chairs)
* Assistants. Even if you are teaching as a group,  having 1-2 assistants will be very helpful, if not essential,  for set-up/strike down especially for the cafe classes and mobile classes.
Please provide the names, email address and phone number of anyone who will be helping you.
