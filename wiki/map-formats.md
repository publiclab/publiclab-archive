##What to download##

Confused by all these different map formats? Read on:

###OpenLayers web viewer###

The easiest way to view a map is by clicking on the OpenLayers link. This will open a web page with a draggable, zoomable map; to share it with people, just send them the URL. These should also be embeddable on your own website; we're working on getting an easy HTML code so you can do that.

###JPG###

The easiest way to download a map, for printing or viewing it offline is to click on the JPG link; this will just let you download a full-resolution JPG image of the map, with a white or black background. 

###GeoTiff###

If you want to download for archival reasons, get the GeoTiff -- it not only has geographic metadata, but it preserves more color and detail than the JPG. It is a much larger file, though, so it may take a while to download.

###TMS: Tiled Map Service###

A TMS is a standards-compliant tile service for you map geeks; this one follows the official TMS spec with the origin at bottom-left. Use [tms-filter](http://tmsfilter.publiclaboratory.org/) to convert between that and the OpenStreetMap-style upper-left convention.

##Extra formats##

_We try to provide these formats for every map, but they are not our "core" formats; that said, if you send us a link to one, we'll probably add it to that map's page._
