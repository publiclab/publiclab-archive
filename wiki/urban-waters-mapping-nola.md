Welcome to the New Orleans Urban Waters Restoration Mapping Project page. This project was funded in part by the EPA Urban Waters Small Grant Program. This community mapping project aimed to maps eight urban restoration sites around New Orleans. Learn more about the sites and visit the maps made in this project below!

**Interested in monitoring a wetland site? Check out the [Wetlands Toolkit](http://publiclab.org/wiki/wetlands-toolkit)!**

###About the project
This data from this project has been collected, compiled and organized by volunteer efforts of the New Orleans Public Lab Community. Between 2014 and 2015 Gulf Coast Public Labbers work to map the eight urban water restoration sites twice. This page hosts the maps and images that came from the proejct. Read more about our project in this article by [Chris Staudinger ](http://www.noladefender.com/content/99-luftballons-diy-eyes-skies-map-nola-weekend)from the NOLA Defender and this [research note](http://www.publiclab.org/notes/Shannon/07-18-2014/epa-and-public-lab-revitalize-urban-waters-in-new-orleans).
####Overall
- 33 data sets were collected of the eight wetland sites amounting to over 25,000 images, 
- 367 community researchers participated in this project ([see photos here!](http://publiclab.org/wiki/people-of-the-new-orleans-urban-waters-project))
- 18 maps were created, along with 7 pole map collages, and
- 33 Gulf Coast meet-ups were held to support the efforts of this project.

###Bayou St. John at Lake Pontchartrain
Bayou St John is an urban Scenic River and site of post-Katrina saltwater marsh restoration, including many locations of urban shoreline re-vegetation with Scirpus and Spartina species in coordination with the Bayou St John Scenic river restoration plan, the LSU AgCenter, Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, and many community partners. In part due to these improvements, the area is becoming an increasingly popular urban recreation destination. Detailed documentation can encourage continued restoration and maintenance of existing restoration efforts. </br>

###Bayou St. John Scenic Urban Waterway
Bayou St John Scenic Urban Waterway is a site of urban shoreline re-vegetation. The site is an increasingly favored location for outdoor recreation of tremendously varied kinds, from dog walking to canoeing and kayaking to fishing, boat races and musical festivals. With high public interest and participation through this project, detailed documentation will encourage the continued restoration and maintenance of restoration efforts. </br>

###Stormwater Wetlands at City Park
Stormwater Wetlands in City Park is a site that embodies many of New Orleansâ€™ urban water issues and goals. The area is subject to much subsidence and ongoing problems from unmanaged stormwater. The "Living with Water" strategy re-envisions water infrastructure as aesthetic, ecological, and geological improvements, and a way to reduce damages from flooding and induced subsidence, and increase property values and quality of life. In an attempt to create a pilot project for the Living with Water scenario, City Park and LSU AgCenter created a stormwater wetland here.

###Bayou Bienvenue Shoreline Restoration
Bayou Bienvenue Shoreline Restoration site shows the marsh shorelines are an aesthetic and ecological improvement to the armored, rubbled, and/or eroded banklines there were historically in place. Community planting of this rubble shoreline was begun during the government shutdown in 2013, and the bullrush have begun to flourish. There is a great deal of community activity and interest in the site for recreation and educational uses. </br>

###Bayou Bienvenue Waste Water Treatment Plant
Bayou Bienvenue/Central Wetlands Treated Biosolids Restoration is a site with a lot of interest! Bayou Bienvenue is an urban, intermediate Bayou and the Bayou Bienvenue wetland triangle (BBWT) is an adjacent former Cypress swamp destroyed by impoundment and saltwater intrusion. Post-Katrina, the site has been subjected to saltwater marsh restoration attempts of many kinds, including created wetlands for biosolids and wastewater treatment, and shoreline re-vegetation with Scirpus and Spartina species, and proposals for additional mechanical fill for hardwood, swamp, and emergent marsh as well as and floating marsh restoration. These various restoration efforts have been done in coordination with Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, Common Ground Wetlands program, LSU AgCenter, Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, National Wildlife Federation, visiting Universities, and many other national and community partners. Due to these improvements and attention, the Bayou is increasingly favored location for outdoor recreation, from fishing to canoeing and kayaking and hunting. </br>

###South Shore Restoration Site

South Shore Marsh Restoration site includes several dispersed community restoration plantings of Spartina alterniflora done in New Orleans East on the south shore of the oligohaline Lake Pontchartrain. These plantings have persisted through several named coastal storms in 2008 and 2012, and provide habitat for estuarine species along an otherwise neglected urban shoreline. These marshes, while small, have persisted beyond their project life, despite being in a high-energy shoreline line in relatively deep water. The site provides an example of how other armored shorelines in the New Orleans metro area can increase habitat value with relatively small, garden-scale, community-based efforts.</br>

###Louisiana Nature Center
The Louisiana Nature Center is an urban site of post-Katrina cypress forest restoration, which includes invasive tallow control and cypress planting efforts. The wetland site is under considerable drainage of the New Orleans East Polder, but still provides forest canopy for migrating birds. Many hope that this site will flourish as a restored cypress forest. There is a long history of naturalist interest in this site, and a long record of weekly bird counts. </br>

###Wetland Watchers Park

Wetland Watchers Park is an educational and recreational park reclaimed from the Lake Pontchartrain bottom. It is the site of a reforestation project between the Bonnet Carre Spillway and Bayou LaBranche, as well as historic and recent marsh restoration projects. This swamp and marsh site (formerly a freshwater swamp, with a remnant canopy) is subject to much shoreline erosion and ecological change, as well as freshwater inputs from Bayou LaBranche and the Bonnet Carre Spillway. The park facilities themselves are designed to be flooded, as they were during Hurricane Isaac in 2012. The park is regularly used by New Orleans area grade and high schools for wetland education. </br>
