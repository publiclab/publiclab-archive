The **Public Lab Timelapse Kit**: fight polluters by catching them on film!

A number of folks are working across the Public Lab network to set up cheap #timelapse cameras. Help out and hold polluters accountable!

## How it works

It doesn't completely -- yet! We're testing this approach in a few places around the country, and looking to prove it out more. 

But the basic idea is to point a timelapse camera at a place where you hope to catch pollution happening, to collect evidence and to pressure them to stop.

This could be used at:

* refineries
* mine sites
* industrial facilities
* anywhere you can safely place the camera


## How to help

We're collecting well-documented examples of this technique in action, and we need:

* great photos of camera setups
* example footage
* easy instructions on how to share your images

## Try it out

We're organizing meet-ups to assemble kits, test them out, document and install them, so that lots of people have a chance to learn how to do this and spread the word. 

The basic kit is based on:

> $103 (with 16g SD card) [Crenova Trail Camera](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016OASTDY/) - 12 megapixel, 8 AA batteries

(note that it's actually 5 megapixels, but it stretches images up to 12, unfortunately)

Get in touch (jeff@publiclab.org) to organize a local group to assemble, document, and test, and report back how it goes.
