The DIY thermographer is a camera which creates an image of what temperature things are -- a 'heat' camera. 

**This approach has been put on hold in favor of the "thermal flashlight" technique which is now posted on the main [Thermal Camera tool page](/tool/thermal-camera)**

We're making a 'scanning thermal imager' which means we just use a temperature sensor and sweep it back and forth across a scene, recording the temperature variation to build up an image that looks like this:

There are two main parts to the project: the camera itself (currently made of Legos and an <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a>, and the website, <a href="http://thermographer.publiclaboratory.org">thermographer.publiclaboratory.org</a>, which helps you create an image from your recorded temperatures. Both are under development and we don't yet have a demo to show you. Check back soon!

###Parts:###

* The camera currently uses a Melexis non-contact infrared thermometer:

  * Datasheet: http://www.melexis.com/Assets/IR-sensor-thermometer-MLX90614-Datasheet-5152.aspx
* Lego turntables: http://www.bricklink.com/search.asp?pg=1&colorID=11&itemID=67722&sz=10&searchSort=P 
* an Arduino
* two EasyDriver stepper motor drivers and matching stepper motors

(above, the first step was to 'clone' an off-the-shelf non-contact IR thermometer)
