**studies, considerations, experimental RMF generator proposal,questions and answers, conclusions**



**Why magnetic fields ?**



Magnetic fields provide superior penetration in biological tissue. At least three physical mechanisms of biological effects of magnetic fields can be identified, namely **molecular**, **supramolecular** and **system**. An important biological process, sensitive to magnetic field, is DNA transcription by polymerase. Like ATP synthesis, catalysis of DNA transcription involves metal ions (Mg, Zn, ...) **The viral replication cycle can be roughly divided into several steps: entry, uncoating, mRNA transcription and protein synthesis, replication of genetic materials, assembly and release. ** However, viruses still need to encode some proteins to facilitate their replication, which can serve as their vulnerabilities.....

**For COVID-19 infection, it’s worth considering the role of rotating magnetic fields (RMF) in the various phases of infection: as prevention, in the incubation period, in the 3 phases of active COVID-19 infection (viremia, acute phase and recovery), in convalesecence and for healing of the infection-damaged tissue.**



**What is a rotating magnetic field  ? **




** A rotating magnetic field** (RMF) is a magnetic field that has moving polarities in which its opposite poles rotate about a central point or axis. Important : not to be confused with a static magnetic field. The rotating field may be created either by a rotating magnet or a set of electromagnets. Rotating magnetic field is when the magnetic field is produced by two alternating currents or moving polarities interacting asynchronously, with opposite poles rotating with synchronous speed, around a central axis.

**What is non-ionizing radiation ? **

**Non-ionizing (or non-ionising) radiation **refers to any type of electromagnetic radiation that does not carry enough energy per quantum (photon energy) to ionize atoms or molecules—that is, to completely remove an electron from an atom or molecule.
Instead of producing charged ions when passing through matter, non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation has sufficient energy** only for excitation**, the movement of an electron to a higher energy state.

**The purpose of the experimental rotating magnetic field generator **is to encourage  more MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND GENETICS, VIROLOGY RESEARCHERS and signal processing experts  to test, as soon as possible,  the effects of rotating magnetic fields applied to different types of viruses (STARTING WITH COVID-19...) and bacteria. With further research, such fields might also be harnessed to facilitate delivery potential treatments.

##**ROTATING MAGNETIC FIELDS experimental generator efficiency  test**


**Considerations :  **


spinning magnet  + stationary coil ( iron core or iron less ) =>  energy transfer.  Energy is transferred from one state to another. 


We have a magnet placed near a coil which has free electrons in it, like in the image below.If the magnet is rotated then the magnetic field around the magnet pulls the charge (electrons) in different direction which in turn causes the flow of electrons in the coil in alternate direction and hence current is generated.


**Important note : the coil used in the test IS NOT a component of the Rmf generator**

Defining the Human Microbiome

The human microbiota consists of the 10-100 trillion symbiotic microbial cells harbored by each person, primarily bacteria in the gut; the human microbiome consists of the genes these cells harbor.Microbiome projects worldwide have been launched with the goal of understanding the roles that these symbionts play and their impacts on human health.

The conclusion was:

" Our results suggest that RMF as an adjunct to antiseptic wound care can significantly improve antibiofilm activity, which has important translational potential for clinical applications."

**Reduction [%]** of growth and biofilm biomass of microorganisms in cultures with (a) gentamicin and (b) ciprofloxacin after 1 h exposure to RMF depending on RMF frequencies. The results are presented as % reduction of growth and biofilm biomass in cultures with antimicrobial in comparison to the culture without antimicrobial after 1 h exposure to RMF and expressed as a mean ± SEM calculated from the four repetitions of the experiment.



**Considerations: **

 "The test wasn't conducted with RMF only ( "+ " gentamicin and  ciprofloxacin ). In addition, it's important to note that not all pathogens create or produce biofilm for survival. They used Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model, but in fairness they have shown effects on other bacteria, including E. coli, as explained in the introduction in previous work."

**RMF  range  10–50 Hz**

"Microbial transport of nutrients and metabolites relies on ion exchange canals; ions are also present inside of bacterial cytoplasm and in the external environment. Bearing in mind that all biological structures are somewhat electrically charged we can, at least partially understand discrepancies between results of other teams investigating magnetic fields."

**What hapens when rotating magnetic field intereact with paramagnetic haemozoin crystals (MALARIA) ?**


[![5Hz_-10_Hz_Malaria.jpg](/i/39035)](/i/39035?s=o)




Paramagnetic haemozoin crystals, a byproduct of the parasite’s haemoglobin digestion, interact with a rotating magnetic field, which prevents their complete formation, causing the accumulation of free haem, which is lethal to the parasites. - " 


**Considerations : **

Over the course of 200,000 years, 108 billion people have lived on Earth. And nearly half, 52 billion, have been killed by mosquitoes. The impact of this disastrous insect has shaped civilization far beyond our expectations, according to historian Timothy C. Winegard, whose new book, The Mosquito: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator, explores this lethal insect.

"The parasite dies at **5 and 10  Hz**. The issue with this is that it's in vitro; it's not being tested alongside human tissue. It's also important to learn how the malaria parasite functions in the host."

The term **in vivo** refers to a medical test, experiment or procedure that is done on (or in) a living organism, such as a laboratory animal or human. 

The term **in vitro**, in contrast to in vivo, refers to a medical study or experiment which is done in the laboratory within the confines of a test tube or laboratory dish.

"The issue I have with this study, is that it's not conducted on humans. How can this procedure be translated to real life subjects?"

R. Tao and K. Huang


https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.84.011905

**Considerations :**

Our body makes 3.8 million cells every second. Most of them are blood. According to biologists Ron Sender and Ron Milo of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, your body replaces around 330 billion cells per day. Most of those are blood cells, followed by cells in your gut. Less than 2 percent of your cell turnover is everything else.Confirming these numbers could help scientists better understand how the human body functions and the role cell turnover plays in both health and disease.  Some cells live just a few days, while others – such as neurons in the cerebellum and lipids in the lenses of our eyes – are limited only by the lifespan of the host.

The article is locked, so it's a mystery to me how this was examined or processed.

**Rotating magnetic field exposure** delays HUVEC senescence. (A, B) HUVECs were exposed to RMF daily for 0 h, 2 h, and 4 h; 20 μM metformin was used as a positive control. SA-β-Gal staining was performed and the number of β-Gal-positive (blue) cells was calculated as a percentage of the total cell number using Image J software. (C, D) Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis of HUVEC after RMF treatment. (E) Western blot analysis showed that RMF exposure increased in AMPK protein expression and decreased P21, P53 and mTOR protein expression.

**Considerations : **

So many things happening in this study.  I think they should have started with C. elegans, then used the same procedure with the endothelial human cells.

Considerations : 

A 10-min exposure of A549 human lung cancer cells to sequential **50- and 385-Hz** oscillating magnetic fields was sufficient to induce intracellular protease release, suggesting altered membrane integrity after the field exposure

**What is a virus ?  **

A  virus is a sub-microscopic infectious agent, that cannot grow or reproduce apart from a living cell. A virus invades living cells and **uses their chemical machinery** to keep itself alive and to replicate itself. It may reproduce with fidelity or with " errors " (mutations); this ability to mutate is responsible for the ability of some viruses to change slightly in each infected person, making treatment difficult. 

##**ABOUT SARS-CoV-2 :** 

The virus attacks the organs that have ACE-2 receptors, such as the lungs, heart, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. 

On entry into the pulmonary system, the SARS-CoV-2 virus attaches itself onto ACE-2receptors. These receptors are mainly found in a small subset of cells in the lung called type 2 alveolar cells. ACE-2 is a receptor similar to ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme, an enzyme in the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS). ACE-2 receptors are also found in the kidney and gastrointestinal tract, which can also harbor SARS-CoV. The scourge of COVID-19 is respiratory failure. This virus can cause diffuse alveolar damage that results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe inflammatory disease of the lung, that can lead to death.

Unlike other types of viral infections, most patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 develop low white blood cell lymphocyte counts (lymphopenia) and pneumonia with characteristic “ground glass opacity” lung changes on chest x-ray or CT. In a study of 41 hospitalized patients, there were high-levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNFα, indicative of the “cytokine storm.



[![the_viral_replcation.jpg](/i/39032)](/i/39032?s=o)



**Considerations:**

 Any electric current (the net movement of electrons) induces a magnetic field and any magnetic field in turn induces an electric field. 

During the life-cycle of a typical virus, the virus does produce a magnetic effect, as the information-carrier molecule is charged and the production of a new virus requires the net transport of charged molecules. Note that by convention **viruses are not living entities**.


If rotating magnetic fields have an effect on the virus **in vitro**, it is possible to not obtain the same effect **in vivo. **




**What happens if a rotating magnetic field is applied in COVID 19 antiviral treatment?**


It is hard to say if it will help or not in direct treatment or as an adjunct to drugs treatment. The presented  studies in this article, referring to application of rotating magnetic fields against bacteria and plasmodium falciparum ( malaria )  indicates encouraging results in combined treatments and direct applications like:  reducing blood viscosity, improving microcirculation and improves treatment and shortens its duration in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,  which can be helpful at the first look, in **COVID 19** treatment, but this would be a **multi-disciplinary research which need the contribution of virology, physic and signal processing experts. **

##_**"Coronavirus, Immunity and Use of Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (PEMF’s)**_"

Medical Director, PEMF Training Academy,

"This paper is intended to discuss the immune responses of the
body to the COVID-19 virus, as we know them now. Also, I will
also present how pulsed electric magnetic fields (PEMFs) affect
inflammation, a hallmark of infection with this virus. " 

**The immune response**


"In most infections, the body mounts a brisk defensive immune response. White blood cell (WBC) counts usually go up, mostly represented by lymphocytes. Lymphocytes engaged in battle with a virus will produce alarm sounding molecules, called cytokines. There are both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The cytokines tell other circulating WBCs that help is needed for the battle. As more and more WBCs enter the fight, progressively greater amounts of cytokines are produced. When the amounts become disproportionately large, the so-called “cytokine storm” happens."

Considerations : " PEMFs have been shown to have multiple supportive anti-infective and immune supportive actions in the body and may be used as an adjunctive therapy pre-infection, during early infection and facilitating recovery after infection "
