A resources collecting page for Hurricane Irma response; we are **not** an emergency service provider, but non-emergency **questions, requests, inquiries, report-ins, offers of help or capacity** are welcome.

### What is this page? 

The purpose of this page is to amplify requests emerging from local community organizations, especially those that work with communities that are bearing the burden of the storm more than others, and many of whom primarily coordinate over the phone or through Facebook groups. 

* **Florida/Georgia relief efforts here: http://irmaresponse.org/**
* if you are **not** affected by the storm and are looking to help support some of the technical challenges and projects surrounding Irma response, visit **http://bit.do/irmastart** to join the slack and see active projects.
* Join Open Call every Tuesday 3pm ET / 2pm Central to discuss https://publiclab.org/wiki/open-call
* For reference, here's the Harvey wiki: https://publiclab.org/wiki/harvey

### Posting asks + offers

We are happy to feature report-ins from folks involved in Harvey response on this page -- you can [post them here](/post?tags=irma,irma-response). If there are **specific asks or offers**, what works best is to break those out as concrete questions, such as:

- we need help with X?
- does anyone need X?

That way we can get people connected up, whether they want to pitch in or they have information you need -- Public Lab's network spans over 10k people.

## Weekly Open Call

Public Lab hosts a weekly public call, and we are happy to offer this as a space for coordinating efforts and inquiries on Harvey response. Calls happen at **2pm CT / 3pm ET on Tuesdays**

Call-in information is at: https://publiclab.org/wiki/open-call and https://pad.publiclab.org/p/opencall

Please add your name and/or comments there, even if you can't join, and we'll do our best to connect the dots. 

Notes from these calls will be listed here:

[irma-calls](../../tag/irma-calls)

### Context

At time of writing, Barbuda has been hit **very** hard, Puerto Rico avoided a direct hit but ~1M people are without power, many without water as a corollary. Paths heading toward the east coast of Florida for Sunday September 9th morning.
