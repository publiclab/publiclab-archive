This is one of a series of guides for collaborative environmental research and advocacy projects. _Scheduling_ is either the briefest guide of the entire [Gardening Toolkit](/wiki/gardening-toolkit) or perhaps not really a guide at all. We're including it, however, it is superimportant to look ahead and set dates aside for some of the larger activities that require multiple people.

Whatever your preferred means of scheduling is, go for it! :) Some gardens have a large bulletin board showing all events of the season, some gardens share an online calendar that everyone can edit. Perhaps you have both! Whatever you have, the important point here is to get your activities onto the calendar so that they actually happen as you designed to reach your goals.
