###Under consideration for NYC workspace###
<strong>Pros: </strong>
sunlight
views of skyline
near williamsburg/bushwich/pratt, JMZ trains
"end of hall suite" - flex room adjacent to wet lab with hoods. 
relatively more affordable (annually, $15/square foot)
getting in as part of the formative renters to help set tone for building. 
could open door to great collaboration with GenSpace
great roof access and encouragement to do whatever we want there. 
space to try out our tools--roof garden
lab space for Yeast and H2S work
room for growth
adjcent school already collaborator with non-profits
diverse neighborhood


<strong>Cons:</strong> 
less convenient than downtown brooklyn
not near Gowanus, our main community (but then again they have their own space). 
Our needs and Genspace needs not totally aligned. 
Currently, we're not paying any rent at all so this is more expensive. 
the "end of hall suite" is a fixer-upper
Parsons has more available for electronics work
