##October 2014

**Objective 1: Scaling engagement** 

* Refer to [Model of Engagement described April 2014](http://publiclab.org/wiki/strategic-plan-community-development#Understanding+our+engagement+model)
* Need to recognize there is a learning curve at each moment, and that to support this learning both online and offline components need development
* Enhance support for organizers: handbook, summit, annual survey, intro videos on profile, role on profile
* Build a strong tech developer community --  first contact moment on  http://publiclab.org/wiki/developers
* Build connections between commenting / following tags on publiclab.org and topic-specific mailing lists
* Q&A "Ask a Question / Answer a Question" structure overlaid on wiki to provide easier entry points
* Need to track depth of engagement by categories that transcend current technologies in use. 

**Objective 2: Incorporating Resilient Social Methodology**

* Resilience, culture, values
  * Scale community welcome/manager functions into the culture of Public Lab itself
* Create clearer chapter models:
  * levels of maturity: “seed,” “shrubbery,” “flowering,” “canopy,” & individual roles to fill: activist, technologist, ambassador, wrangler (via profile tagging)
* Prioritize the creation of new social event guides / series of workshops, including: 
  * place-based stakeholder engagement, 
  * collaborative goal setting /  identifying the problem, 
  * community asset mapping on paper and with mapknitter (related to OpenLand GM eval), 
  * reliable interaction modes (best practices that can be flexibly mixed and matched) that support the strengths of different types of contributors -- setting tone (tenor of event, what is expected when people walk in) and communicating that an event is speculative with unknown outcomes
  * the design of research that prefigures the future use of the data for advocacy.
* Create a guide that bridges tool incubation with community process /wiki/new-projects, articulate the “win-win” of developing in community.
  * begin with Mat + Adam's tool ladder illustration + expand the diagram with other points where community partners can connect with PL
* Incorporate project management tools for high capacity projects:
  * partner tracking, 
  * transparent task management that welcomes new contributors, 
  * articulating and reporting back “soft” outcomes that are usually omitted from research notes (conversations with politicians, sidebars with gov’t employees, numbers of passers-by spoken with, etc).
* Manage the projection of expertise, of staff, of organizers, of jargony newcomers. Instead, take on role of "bard" in new and legacy projects--the oral tradition of Creative Commons.


**Objective 3: Integrating Outreach with Kits**

* moving from customer to member
  * kit boxes have a checkbox that says "this tool is available for community use"
  * geographic outreach (profile tagging by region, regional mailing list outreach, international chapter development)
* Connect Tool Incubation to community development
* Connect bulk sales to Education Working Group

###Understanding our engagement model

1. [First Contact](http://publiclab.org/wiki/strategic-plan-community-development#First+contact)

####First contact

* trace how folks first find encounter Public Lab and get drawn in: http://publiclab.org/wiki/first-contact
  *  kits (online store, physical packaging, object without packaging), web presence, social media, press coverage, heard about from a person (evangelism?), Kickstarter campaign, ...
* ISSUE: website **front page**
  * too much information, lacks community presence/identity, not synthesized


####Welcome moment

* **Looking for how I "fit in"**
  * lead with values
  * culturally, is the first "welcome" over dinner or by typing into a technical discussion?
  * identifying the "need" to engage -- begin with what is already known locally -- asset mapping exercise -- needs to be systematized. This can combat the perception problem of tools seen as speculative not results-oriented. 
  * attracting diversity in the context that many current active members have leisure time, are high capacity with degrees.
* **whose responsibility is it to welcome / orient new members who ask?**
  * everyone / no one?
  * Welcome Working Group: good, but has scaling issues
* **option to speak to **types** of stakeholders:** 
  * [reference from Sugar Labs](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Getting_Involved), 
  * and Scott's metaphor below:
