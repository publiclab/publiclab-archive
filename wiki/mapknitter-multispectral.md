MapKnitter has an experimental feature allowing you to choose an overlapping secondary map with infrared photos, and generate an export which composites the two in "NRG" mode. Both maps must have been exported already. See [an example here](https://mapknitter.org/tms/savethebay-providence-nrg/openlayers.html)

The feature can be found in the "Export" dialog box, in the third tab, as shown here:
