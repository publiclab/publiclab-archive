During our recent Kickstarter campaign a good number of people from London supported Public Lab and will soon be receiving balloon kits. We are planning to do mapping events with people who are getting our kits in places such as New York and San Francisco during what we've started referring to as "March Mapping Madness", but since a couple people from Public Lab will be in London next week, we are wondering if there are others in London besides our Kickstarter supporters that might be interested in coming to an aerial mapping meet-up to go over the aerial mapping process, hear a bit more about project ideas, go over the associated image stitching platform (mapknitter.org), etc.

A professor at UCL has kindly offered to let us use a room during the late afternoon/early evening of Tuesday, February 14th to host a meet-up between 5-6 or 6:30pm. If you are interested in attending, please send Shannon a message (shannon@publiclaboratory.org).

Unfortunately, we have little flexibility with this date as we will be attending the UCL Citizen Cyberscience Summit later in the week. However, this event is open to the public and Public Lab will be running a thermal flashlight workshop on Saturday if you are interested in attending. More information on this event can be found here: http://www.citizencyberscience.net/summit2/.
