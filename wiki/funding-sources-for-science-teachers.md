##What I am trying to do
This is a place where science teachers can find resources and advice when looking for money to fund stuff like new instruments, probeware, balloon mapping essentials, soft-serve ice cream machines and other scientific essentials.  I had hoped that I would somehow get my act together and organize some of the stuff here before putting it online, but that is clearly never coming to pass.  Instead, I am now going to put what I have online and anyone interested can get in and help clean it up, add some organization, delete things that are out of date (I understand that the Enron Foundation is no longer accepting applications) and add relevant information.
##Advice for writing grant proposals:
Step 1:  Figure out what you want to do (this is generally the hard part and I don't think I can help here).  Step 2:  Figure out what it will cost to do what you want to do.  DO NOT give low-ball estimates of costs.  If you need to buy out teaching time, find out what that costs and include it in your budget.  DO NOT inflate your costs.  Step 3:  Talk to people in your organization about the project.  If your administration does not support your project, then you will not be able to proceed.  Step 4:  Identify funding agencies with an interest in what you want to do.  In addition to the agencies listed below, look into industries that have a major presence in your state.  They will frequently have foundations that support education in the locations where they have a presence.  Always go to the web site for the granting agency you are interested in and determine if what you want to do fits with their mission.  Each grant program will have a web page that describes the mission, scope, and requirements of the grant.  Once you read that material carefully (ie, you are not wasting the time of the people at the agency with questions that are obviously answered on the web page) call the funding agency and speak with a grants officer about the project you wish to pursue.  That person was hired to help the agency allocate funds to achieve the agency's goals.  If your project is not aligned with the goals of the agency, the grants officer will keep you from wasting your time. If your goals are the same as those of the agency, the program officer will help you get the money you need to achieve your common goals.  Your program officer is your friend.  You want a good working relationship with that person (it is that simple).  Step 5:  Write the first draft of your grant proposal.  This should be a profanity laden stream-of-conscious rant.  Logic is optional at this stage.  Anger is your friend.  Step 6:  Refine your proposal.  Remove profanity, add necessary organization, group similar thoughts, remove redundancies.  Evaluate the logic of your arguments.  Plug holes in your logic with stream-of-conscous ranting.  Step 7:  Go back through Step 6.  Continue refining until you have a well-crafted document that explains your goals, why they are important, what your current resources are, how you are qualified to carry out the work, what other resources you will need to achieve your goals and basically how you are going to do what you want to do.  Step 8:  Get a friend to do a critical evaluation of your proposal. Step 9:  Call your "friend" while drunk and crying, scream at at the top of your lungs how they could never do as well.  Step 9:  Apologize to friend and go back to step 6. 
##General resources for helping you write your proposal
Vernier Instruments has some nice resources for teachers to write grants.  They have a white-paper that draws together research papers that document the education benefits of using probeware.  You can request a copy from [this site](http://www.vernier.com/forms/whitepaper/).  They also have a concise guide that will help you get started.  It can be found [here](http://www.vernier.com/files/misc/grant_writing_guide.pdf).
