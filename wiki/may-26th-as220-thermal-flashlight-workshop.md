This weekend Public Lab had its first Public event in Providence Rhode Island, hosted by [[http://labs.as220.org/|AS220 Labs]].  It was a big success with each participant making their own Thermal Flashlight from scratch. A huge thanks is deserved to those who helped others trouble shoot this process particularly Byeongwon, Megan and Matt!

This page is for those involved in the workshop to add photos, thoughts and reflections on the workshop.

We also kicked off a Public Lab Providence mailing list.

##Here are a couple of starting thoughts:##

1. We should annotate the Flashlight code so it is easily understandable for non-programmers.  Particularly making clear where the temperature is set in the code. We had confusion because the default temperature range 60 to 75 degrees, was exceeded by the summer temperatures in the upper 70s so the color of the light did not vary. It was quickly fixed by expanding the temperature range.

2. In the future we could split the workshop into two sections: one for making flashlights, one for imaging. As it was we didn't get enough time for the imaging portion.

##Progress to document on the Flashlight development (It would be amazing to get research notes or participants thoughts on these)##

1. Neat DIY Flashlight Dish for enhancing the range of the Thermal Flashlight

2. Experimental approaches for figuring out the range of the Thermal Flashlight

3. Alternative screen capture application for Macs

##How to Make Research Notes##

1. [[http://publiclaboratory.org/join|Sign-up for Public Lab]]

2. Once you are signed in you can [[http://publiclaboratory.org/note/add|Start a Research Note]]

3. Subscribe to Thermal Flashlight project updates, Providence updates or up dates from particular researchers. At the bottom of each research note you can find a drop down menu labelled "subscription". Click that menu you and can subscribe to the author's note, the place and the research theme.
