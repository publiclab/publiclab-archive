###Desktop browsers

Most modern desktop browsers have the ability to connect directly to hardware webcams, making it unnecessary to run a desktop program to operate [your spectrometer](/wiki/spectrometer). 

Browsers that are confirmed to work include:

* Firefox
* Chrome 21+
* Opera
* any browser which supports the HTML5 getUserMedia() call

###Mobile browsers

On smartphones, several browsers support the HTML5 webcam API, and connect directly to the camera of the phone.

* [Firefox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox) on Android
* [Opera](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.browser) on Android
* [Chrome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome) on Android
* [Bowser](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bowser/id560478358) on iOS


###Flash-based fallback###

A Flash-based video capture system is partially implemented, and should soon work for browsers without the MediaStream API.
