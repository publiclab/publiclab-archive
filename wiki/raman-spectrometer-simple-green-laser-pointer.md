By using an ordinary green laser pointer, the kind commonly found in offices, an Israeli research team has developed a new and highly portable Raman spectrometer that can detect extremely minute traces of hazardous chemicals in real time. The researchers will present their findings next week at Laser Science XXVIII—the  American Physical Society Division of Laser Science’s Annual Meeting—collocated with the Optical Society’s (OSA) Annual Meeting, Frontier in Optics(FiO).
