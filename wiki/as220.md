> AS220 is a non-profit community arts organization located in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. We are an unjuried, uncensored forum for the arts: a space to access tools, technology and knowledge; a space to come together, collaborate, innovate, experiment and take risks. AS220 envisions a just world where all people can realize their full creative potential.

## Kits

AS220 Industries hosts Modern Device, which offers a range of open source electronics, including accelerometers, wind, and other sensors help your project interact with its surroundings.
