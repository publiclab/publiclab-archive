###Questions###
* who will do newsletter this week? Liz?
* what if there was a dedicated mailing list just for the newsletter? start this discussion in web group. 
* Liz -- google docs organization -- who has a good system that i can copy? search function is preferable. 
* who is shared on dropbox? can we unshare people and start organizing this? How do people use dropbox to accept photos from community members?
* admin docs, not many in dropbox? because inappropriate to have personal info online, shan has locally. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/997cqrz2s4y1tkg/rkWbjwvNed
* issue with sharing passwords on different services -- no other good options. 
* to help with admin, focus on fundraising (grant research and delivery) and membership. Continuing even once we hire a full time person. We can each take a specific role on grant writing, almost metaphorically rolling through timezones (start on east, proofread on west coast). 

###Meetings###
* Organizers call at 12:20 this week, Stewart moderating. 

###Miscellaneous###

###Newsletter suggestions###
