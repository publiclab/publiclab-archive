Wastewater is “used water” that’s created by households, cities, and industry. It ranges from sewage to surface runoff that can flow from roadways into storm drains. Untreated or under-treated wastewater can contain a variety of pollutants that can harm people and ecosystems when it’s released into the environment. 

On this page, we’re collecting information on some of the clues that might indicate wastewater pollution in the environment, and ways to investigate them. Some methods assess general water quality conditions that can correlate with wastewater pollution, while other methods can more directly signal the presence of wastewater by identifying specific pollutants.

### **Change in water color or clarity** 

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
<b><i>Why?</b></i> Solid particles, chemicals, or microscopic organisms in wastewater can give it a color or cloudy appearance. When wastewater is discharged into the environment, you might see a discolored plume in a river or a colored residue on land. </div>

_**METHODS:**_

#### **Documenting visual changes in water color or clarity**

<br>

#### **Documenting changes in water color/clarity with spectral imagery (might not be visible to human eyes)**

+ [Infrared balloon image reveals Gowanus plume](https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/8-3-2011/ir-reveals-gowanus-plume), and note [this comment](https://publiclab.org/notes/liz/8-3-2011/ir-reveals-gowanus-plume#c9960) that the plume is likely flowing sewage sludge that shows up in the near-infrared range because of the bacteria and small algae in the sludge.
+ Multispectral analysis of satellite images: like in the paper, “[Tracking stormwater discharge plumes and water quality of the Tijuana River with multispectral aerial imagery](http://oceani.com/PDF/Tracking%20stormwater%20discharge%20plumes.pdf),” by Svejkovsky et al. 2010.

#### **Measuring turbidity of water** 

Solid particles floating throughout the water (called suspended solids) increase its turbidity. Learn more about turbidity in [this research note](https://publiclab.org/notes/anngneal/12-08-2017/7-ways-to-measure-monitor-and-evaluate-water-quality#7.+Assessing+the+Turbidity,+TSS+and+Clarity) from @anngneal.

### **Odor**

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
<b><i>Why?</b></i> Clean water should have no smell or a slightly earthy smell. Other smells could indicate under-treated wastewater.
</div>

See [this comment](https://publiclab.org/questions/bhamster/07-28-2021/what-are-some-observable-tell-tale-signs-of-wastewater-pollution#c29094) from @jesseslone about odors near wastewater discharge areas and what they might indicate.

### **Changes in water temperature**

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
<b><i>Why?</b></i> Wastewater can be warmer than the waterbodies it’s dumped into. This includes sewage and wastewater produced from industrial processes.

Sense changes in water temperature and display temperature differences with colored lights in the field. Take a long-exposure photograph to record the results!

### **Conductivity**

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
<b><i>Why?</b></i> Water that has more inorganic solids dissolved in it (like salts or chemical pollutants)  generally conducts electricity better---it has a higher <a href="https://publiclab.org/wiki/common-water-contaminants#Conductivity">conductivity</a>
</div>

For example, salty wastewater (brine) associated with fracking can cause a spike in water conductivity (source: [FracTracker](https://www.fractracker.org/projects/water-monitor/intro/)). 

Organic pollutants like oil, however, don’t generally conduct electricity well and may lower the conductivity of water. 

>“A failing sewage system would raise the conductivity because of the presence of chloride, phosphate, and nitrate; an oil spill would lower the conductivity.” - [US EPA](https://archive.epa.gov/water/archive/web/html/vms59.html)

### **Indicator chemicals or components**

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
<b><i>Why?</b></i> The presence of certain chemicals or living things in water can suggest pollution from wastewater.

<br>

#### **Organic waste and oxygen** 

Certain bacteria help to clean water by breaking down organic wastes, and they use oxygen in the process. Measuring the amount of oxygen in water and how readily it might be used can help create a picture of how much organic waste is present and how well it’s breaking down.

#### **Bioindicators and bioassays**

#### **Spectrometry methods for wastewater: a grab bag** 

Lots of people at Public Lab are interested in spectrometry and have experience using spectrometers for environmental monitoring. We’re collecting some approaches for detecting various things related to wastewater here:
