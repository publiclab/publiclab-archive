This is a template. This is a good place to give a little background on the project. Keep it simple. Mention your goals and any outcomes you're hoping for from this project. 

### Location

Where is this project happening? Who lives here, and in what way are they affected? What geographic area? What's the weather like? What is the ecosystem (tropical, high altitude, ...)? Are there any major features nearby, like highways or a desert? Is there a specific industrial landuse that you are concerned about? 

### Goals and Motivations

Why are you taking action? Can be as general as "I'm concerned about XXXX" or contain specific goals such as "I want to collect data on the water quality impact caused by the confined animal feed operation nearby". Also consider organizing the sub-questions motivating your inquiry by using the Questions feature, below.
