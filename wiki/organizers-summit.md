The day before the [Northeast Barnraising](http://publiclab.org/notes/Hudonnoodles/04-30-2014/northeast-tool-focused-barnraising-june-6-8-2014), the Organizers Summit is set aside as a time to share ideas, brainstorm projects and share strategies.  The agenda is open and contributions to it can be made on the "talk" page of this wiki. Ideas include:

####- How do we share information and manage projects?
####- How do we support new organizers and grow our chapters?
####- What does Public Lab teamwork look like?
####- What are meaningful community + technologist interactions?
####- What are ways to turn data to action?

Add your thoughts, ideas and talking points to the [Talk](/p/organizers-summit) page!
Looking forward to seeing you then! 

_If you are not able to make it to the Summit in MA, there will be one held later in the summer on the Gulf Coast!_
