Different organizations and coalitions of people with specific sets of expertise have been organized to offer support of different kinds -- from professional scientists to people organizing around environmental issues. This page collects links to a variety of these efforts by topic and region.

## Professional scientists

Sometimes it's helpful to get input from someone with a professional background in a specific field, and although there are plenty of people like that on PublicLab.org, there are also a number of other networks out there to get help from.

* http://500womenscientists.org -- "Our mission is to serve society by making science open, inclusive, and accessible." (now over 5k women scientists!)
