<strong>Day 1 - Proof of concept: </strong> Beverly and Adam floated a short section of the Shenandoah River from Brown Cabin to the canoe launch in the park.  

<strong>Day 2: </strong> In the AM, Bill and Rex successfully converted a Canon A490 each using the PLOTS video posted on the IR page.
In the afternoon, Bill and Gayle collected imagery from land.
Alan, Beverly, and John collected VIS aerial imagery on the river between Brown Cabin and the canoe launch in the park.
Rex, Bill, and Adam collected VIS and IR imagery on the river between the low water bridge and Brown Cabin.

<strong>Day 3: </strong>We spent two hours building maps in MapKnitter, contrasting methods in Microsoft ICE and Photoshop, and discussing the general mapping concepts.  A couple of more hours were spent sending GoPros and some obliquely mounted cameras.
