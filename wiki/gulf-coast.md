###Welcome to The Public Lab Gulf Coast Page

We are: engaged citizens, researchers, educators, community organizers, hackers, more and all of the above! Since 2010 weâ€™ve been working hard on spearheading many projects, developing DIY technology and spending time in the community working to celebrate our natural resources and the protection of them. 

Some of our projects have included mapping of the BP Oil Spill in 2010, continued mapping and monitoring of the Barataria Bay focusing on the importance of our wetlands and restoration and working with other public labbers to develop the DIY spectrometer!  For a better view of our projects and the people involved in them, see our timeline below, the research tab and search the tag gulf-coast on the Public Lab page. 
 
Our office is located in New Orleans, LA at 3014 Dauphine Street. Stop in and say hello!

Check out our project Mapping Wetlands in New Orleans! This project brought together volunteers and local community members to discover and use Public Lab technologies to track the progress of eight urban wetland restoration projects near Lake Pontchartrain. Through training sessions and field work, Gulf Coast residents had the opportunity to learn and use the aerial photography tools to map and monitor the health of our local restoration sites.

**2010-2011 _The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Mapping _**

Since May 2010, we have been using [balloon mapping](/tool/balloon-mapping) to capture aerial imagery of spill-affected sites in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Our work on the Gulf Coast in 2010, was done in cooperation with groups such as the [Louisiana Bucket Brigade](http://labucketbrigade.org) and the University of South Alabama on a community-led monitoring of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The data has been gathered can be viewed in:

***[the Public Laboratory Archive &raquo;](/archive)***

More images and information can be found at:

* https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/gulfoilmap/
* http://unterbahn.com/thesis - Chapter 8: Case Study: Citizen mapping of the BP oil spill (5.7 mB, 14 pages)
* and in the various press and publications listed [on our media page](http://publiclab.org/media)

While mapping the oil spill, we were not trying to duplicate the satellite or flyover imagery (though we helped to coordinate some of the flyovers and tried to ensure that the data was publicly accessible). Instead, we were helping Gulf Coast residents to use balloons, kites, and other simple and inexpensive tools to produce their own documentation of the disaster and hoping that such data collection will continue to support environmental research, policy, and regulatory changes in coming years.
