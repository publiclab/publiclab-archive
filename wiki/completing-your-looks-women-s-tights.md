Now that the temperatures have dropped it can feel a little too chilly to wear our favourite dresses and skirts, unless we have the perfect pair of <a href="http://www.etights.co.uk/">women’s tights</a> to accompany them. If you have the perfect little black dress for your office Christmas party, but are worrying about baring your legs in the cold, why not wear a fashionable pair of women’s tights? You do not have to go for traditional skin coloured tights or black tights either. There are plenty of fashionable pairs available in a variety of patterns including floral, animal print and polka dot. Complete your look with a killer pair of stiletto heels and a cute patent clutch bag for a chic and sweet Christmas party look. You will look the belle of the ball and will feel better than you do not have to suffer from catching a cold on the walk back from the party!
