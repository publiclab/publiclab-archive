##Programs##

Two main arcs - how do we choose programs, and how do we administer/run them?

This is an overview and initial conversation, we should follow up with a big meeting in Sept. - work charts, problem trees, etc.

Recommend we form groups around program areas today, we can shuffle later & revisit in Sept, and that we come to some consensus on what our program areas are? Both today, and what we’d like them to be in the near future.

###Choosing programs###

Summary of current programs (help out, add in stuff where you can!):

How should we define a program?
A program is an issue area or topic, 
There are also cross cutting practices.

**1 Petro-chemical industries and extraction industries**

  * Tools: Spectrometer, NDVI, Endocrine disruption screen, UV, water quality, thermal camera
  * Sites: Gulf coast, Gowanus/NYC, (possible: appalacchia), Gas patch, tar sands, Butte
  * Collaborators? Skytruth, LABB, Gowanus canal conservancy (is greatly affected by this, but acting in area 3), 

**2 Environmental health** (in many cases related to the above)

  * indoor/outdoor (is this “presence of harmful chemicals, frequently resulting from chemical or extraction industries, or from industrial production of goods like indoor furniture; and resulting health effects on living organisms?”)
  * Outdoor: NDVI, GRM, spectrometer, Endocrine disruption screen, water quality
    * Sites: Gulf Coast, NYC, gas patch
  * Indoor: spectrometer, roomba, Endocrine disruption screen, thermal camera
    * Sites: homes, schools,
  * Collaborators? Asthma files, 

**3 (this one needs work) Changes [sustainable] land usage? Ecological sustainability?**

  * (is this ecological productivity -- soil health, photosynthetic activity, ?) 
sustainable agriculture - local, organic, small, family, community, broadly defined
  * Tools: near-Infrared camera, GRM, NDVI	
  * Sites: Wetlands - silt, runoff, riparian buffer zones, bioswales), Somerville

##Working groups:##

First name is chairperson/lead coordinator for the group's topic:

1 Outreach - conferences, meet ups, barnraising, exhibitions - **Sara**, shannon, jeff mathew
2 Retail - kits: **Adam**, Stewart, Jeff, Mathew
3 Fundraising- **Jeff**, Shannon, Adam, Mathew (grant writing), sara (grant writing), Liz
4 Outcomes - outreach with existing data, legal/policy leverage, papers, exhibitions - **Shannon**, Sara, Adam
5 Evaluation, interviews- **Shannon**, Sara, Mathew
6 Public Archive/Online systems? web infrastructure - **Stu**, Jeff (liz in part)
7 GM Forum, printing - **Mathew**, Stu, jeff, shannon
8 PR - press releases, social media outreach, website content - videos- **Liz**, Jeff, Stu
9. Budget- **Shannon**, Sara....everyone

##Tool Working Groups:##

_In Use_

9 GRM: Kites and balloons- **Mathew**, Stu, Liz

_Not Proven Yet_ 

11 Infrared camera (NDVI, NRG, false color) - **Jeff**, Stu, Liz
10 Spectrometry - **Jeff**, Sara
12 Roomba - **Sara**, Shannon (liz interested in air qual sensors for wide use)--Indoor air
13 water quality/endocrine disruption- **Sara**, Shannon, mathew, liz
14 thermal camera - **Liz or Stu**, Jeff, Sara

15 Research and Development future projects - stereo camera for 3D, deriving point clouds, diy lidar (liz interested) stu, sara
16 Program area review -- assess our work in the context of our program areas, every x months (6?)

Review every 6 months? Other timelines depending on working group

Other notes:

##Summary of existing work today:##

* Publishing & kits:
  * GM Forum
  * PLOTS Website, community blog, PLOTS archive
  * balloon mapping kit, spectrometer kit, (infrared camera, thermal camera)
* Public Events & outreach
  * workshops, hackathons, barn-raisings
  * lectures, attending others’ public events (dorkbot, local meetups, community planning meetings)
* Site work:
  * Gulf coast: summarize? Oil spill, flooding, wetlands loss
  * Gowanus: water and air contamination, bioswale remediation zones
  * Portland, Butte, Somerville, WCU, Providence, Togo, Belize... more? Which have a long-term commitment?
* Topic areas: 
  * water/land contamination (oil, etc) - extraction industries
  * environmental health (in many cases related to the above)
  * wetlands loss & wetlands as remediation zones
  * sustainable agriculture - local, organic, small, family, community, broadly defined
  * others?
* Feedback loops:
  * GM Forum interviews and articles
  * PLOTS Archive, interviews, comments, embedding, “how to use this data”
  * Journals, op-eds & other writing
  * public events, exhibitions, 
  * data refinement, analysis, interpretation in all of these feedback loops
  * data outreach - publishing our work and getting it taken up by law, policy, research, academia, education

* Proposals: we’ve already done this for some; these ought to exist on the website, no?
  * choosing process -- how many? 3-5 sites, no less than 7 major programs, site or otherwise.
  * mini vs. mega projects - how may can each person tackle? More than one staffer on each project?
    * could there be larger #s of mini projects, or each person can have their own mini project which may mature into a mega one later down the road? Limit on how many mini programs?
  * early, mid, mature projects: 70%/20%/10%? how to narrow them down? Base this partially on documentation/literature produced
  * choosing could be related to how many people sign up to work on the project? “putting together a team” - where people might only have 3-5 projects each, max?

##Summary of tools:##

Kites and Balloons
* Need full set for all wind conditions and a guide for choosing flying
* potential for air quality monitoring by building line-runners.
IR → postprocessing for ndvi
Stereo Cameras  → postprocessing for topography / 3D
Thermal Camera
Air Quality
* VOCs
* Carbon Monoxide
Water Testing
* Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Nutrients
* Heavy Metals
* Micropollutants, organic compounds, etc.
* biologicals
  * fecal coliform/total coliforms
  * bod/cod
* turbidity
*Soil Testing
* Nutrients
* Heavy Metals
* Micropollutants

###Administrating programs###

* Recommend groups of 2-3 for each program/project, where one person is lead. (this became Working Groups, above)
  * Both group leadership and membership can rotate every 3-6 months, for sites, this is partially limited by proximity.
  * Recommend autonomy and budget control (with reviews/checks/balances) within each group to reduce overhead and make decision making localized. Different groups can figure things out based on local context and share, rather than making top-down decisions.Cross-subscription of members should maximize communication.
  * each group ought to meet by phone once or twice a week. Only 2-3 people should be easier. Post weekly notes.
