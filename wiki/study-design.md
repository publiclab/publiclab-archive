Some communities facing environmental health concerns start a research project to document and build accountability -- producing data that can be used in advocacy, regulatory action and more. 

For an in-depth guide to planning out an environmental monitoring study, 
 see this page:

https://publiclab.org/wiki/start-enviro-monitor-study

The guide touches on topics like:

* Determining the Question at Hand
* Researcher Resources
* Geographic Scope
* Types of Samples
* Sampling Methods
* Data Storage
* Interpreting Data
* Data Advocacy
