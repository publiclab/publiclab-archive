The Public Lab Oil Testing Kit is an attachment to Public Lab's v3.0 Desktop Spectrometer which holds a sample container and a laser. 

##The Basic Spectrometer

Public Lab first began developing cheap spectrometers in the winter of 2010, after the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then [we've made enormous progress](/wiki/spectrometer-history) and have [a variety of designs for less than $100](/wiki/spectrometer), but the OTK is based around the  [USB webcam-based Desktop Spectrometry Kit v3.0](http://store.publiclab.org/products/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0) ([see plans here](/wiki/desktop-spectrometry-kit-3-0))

Of course, the plans for all of these are [on the Public Lab website](/wiki/spectrometer) and are open source hardware designs, so you can always make your own -- the kits are intended to help you get started.

##The Oil Testing Kit attachment

You'll also need a frame to hold your sample container and align a laser beam perpendicular to your spectrometer. For that, we've developed the Beta Oil Testing Kit, an add-on to the Desktop Spectrometer v3.0 pictured here, attached:

[![IMG_20150521_145931_2.jpg](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/454/medium/IMG_20150521_145931_2.jpg)](https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/454/original/IMG_20150521_145931_2.jpg)

If you [join the Beta testing program](/wiki/oil-testing-kit-beta), you can then sign up for [the add-on "Beta" Oil Testing Kit](http://store.publiclab.org/products/spectrometry-sampling-kit) (see [parts list](#Parts+list) to assemble your own) in combination with the existing [Desktop Spectrometry Kit](http://store.publiclab.org/products/desktop-spectrometry-kit), which is what was used in the examples on this page. 

##Assembly

See [this excellent research note](/notes/mathew/04-07-2015/assembling-the-oil-testing-kit-cuvette-frame
) for assembly instructions.

Additionally, we've added a light-blocking flap which reduces ambient light. This extra piece (source file here: 
<a href="https://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/011/022/original/light-flap.svg"><i class="icon icon-file"></i> light-flap.svg</a>) fits into the OTK frame and can be held or taped shut while activating the laser:

#Parts list

_These are links to where you can buy parts to assemble your own oil testing kit_

##Sampling materials

Part | Est. price | Link
------------|-------------|-----------------
acrylic/PMMA cuvettes -- containers for your samples | $0.25 each | http://www.amazon.com/BrandTech-759086D-acrylic-Semi-Micro-Spectrophotometry/dp/B004WFD7RW/ (NOT polystyrene - they melt when filled with lighter petroleum!)
5oz mineral oil (baby oil -- the added fragrance doesn't fluoresce) | $3 | http://www.amazon.com/Johnson-Baby-Oil-Kids-Ounce/dp/B000GCJM06/
eyedropper | $6 for 100 |  http://www.amazon.com/Plastic-Transfer-Pipettes-Gradulated-Pack/dp/B005IQTSE0/
cotton swabs | ~$3 for 500 | http://www.amazon.com/Q-tips-Cotton-Swabs-500-Count/dp/B00I6A69TM/

##Laser

* a 405nm blue/violet laser pen: [$3 from Alibaba](http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/700677050/well_tested_405_nm_blue_laser.html), or for purchasing singles [here](http://www.ebay.com/itm/2in1-5mw-Blue-Violet-Purple-Laser-Pointer-Pen-With-Star-Cap-405nm-Best-Selling-/301258047058)  Some people feel having the caps are useful for dispersing the laser when necessary so if you want more caps perhaps [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/6-in-1-5mW-405nm-Violet-purple-Blue-Laser-Pointer-with-5-Patterns-Star-Caps-/371078275357) will be to your liking  

##Frame

Download and cut out all the five pieces on dark, [card-stock weight paper such as this](http://www.neenahpaper.com/FinePaper/ROYALSUNDANCEPapers):

###Alternative parts

We've tried many different bottles and parts; some are no longer available, or had shortcomings. But here's a list of links to things we've tried!

* Nail polish bottles, with built-in bottlecap-swabs. An all-in-one, one-use pre-filled with mineral oil! Maybe you break off the swab and throw it away, or maybe it doesn't matter.
