With the Public Lab Community Microscope, your students can explore the invisible microscopic world around them using a microscope they've built themselves! This microscope is the result of many teams' work coming together. You can learn more about the journey on our [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/the-community-microscope-kit)

On this page, you can:

 - Learn more about the educator community at Public Lab
 - Purchase Community Microscope Kits for your classroom
 - Get instructions for assembling your microscope
 - Find lessons designed around the Community Microscope
 - Get help from the FAQ, or ask your own question

## Education & Public Lab: Get Involved!

** (want to insert image here, unsure about how to resize them.) **

We're creating a strong community of practice where educators of all experiences can sharing resources, knowledge, and lend a hand. [You can learn more about this here.](publiclab.org/wiki/education)

## Getting Classroom Kits For Your School

We offer a variety of tools and kits that can be used in educational settings. ****We offer a 10% discount on bulk educational purchases, and we are always happy to work with educators to make suggestions and prepare custom orders to meet your needs.****

## Using the Community Microscope

Here we would curate a list of lessons for the microscope. Pin the Hello World Activity (would it be an interesting video?) Use a tag like 'edu-microscope-lesson' to get things to show up here.

## Get Help

Here is where we'd put our curated FAQ. Undecided whether this would look like a research note that we add to or a list of questions with a special tag that others are unlikely to use. I think if we use questions there needs to be a way to mark an "answer" even if it's a staff member compiling the best bits and pieces from the comments to make one cohesive answer"
