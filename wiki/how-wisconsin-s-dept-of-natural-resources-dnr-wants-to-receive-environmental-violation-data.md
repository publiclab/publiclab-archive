Residents of Wisconsin seeking to file incident reports or complaints relating to environmental violations are directed to an array of options within the Wisconsin Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) website (http://dnr.wi.gov/). If a spill or violation requires immediate assistance, "the Emergency hotline number to call is:   1-800-943-0003."
"The DNR's Violation Hotline provides Wisconsin citizens with the opportunity to confidentially report non-emergency suspected wildlife, recreational and environmental violations using a toll free number:  Call or text 1-800-847-9367. 
These violations may include fishing or hunting out of season, night hunting, exceeding bag limits, illegal sale of fish and wildlife, deposit of harmful substances in lakes or rivers or illegal storage or disposal of hazardous waste. All these violations seriously affect our state's natural resources.
The Violation Hotline is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Information received on this line will be relayed to a DNR officer for investigation. You do not have to leave your name when reporting a violation. However, it is often helpful to an investigation if a DNR Law Enforcement Officer can follow-up on your report to verify essential facts and let you know the outcome of the investigation. If provided, your identity and any information that may identify you will be protected under state statute 23.38."

Since the Tab labeled "[Spill Reporting Requirements](http://dnr.wi.gov/emergency/documents/rr560.pdf)" now leads to the message: "Page Not Found:
The Web page that you are looking for is no longer on the server," the following summary of procedures for reporting incidents and registering complaints was derived from a review of the Wisconsin DNR Website.

** How to Report a Spill:**

"Discovery of Spills Through Analysis - Soil or groundwater contamination that is discovered via sampling.
