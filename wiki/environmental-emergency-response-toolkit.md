### The Toolkit

We're working to assemble a set of tools that can help people in responding to the environmental impact of a disaster-- data collection and documentation tools that can be used safely in the days, weeks and months after a disaster so that:

*causes of pollution can be documented quickly and compared to baseline data
*the extent of an impact can be clearly understood
*communities affected by the environmental issues caused by an event can advocate and pursue effective responses and remediation
*communication between community members and people/groups that may be in a position to provide remote support can be facilitated
*tools are easy to access, learn, and use by members of a community without a long onboarding/training period.

We'll be exploring some of the ideas we generated in the [Houston/Galveston Barnraising](https://publiclab.org/wiki/barnraising-texas-2019)

#### Challenges

Environmental Emergencies will affect people and landscapes in very different ways depending on geography, the nature of the emergency, the speed at which it unfolds (and continues to develop), and the health and safety needs of the people closest to the event.

#### The Emergency Response Toolkit

We're working with the Public Lab community to develop a set of tools that can help people collect meaningful environmental data to help them understand and communicate about the scope of an emergency's environmental impact.
