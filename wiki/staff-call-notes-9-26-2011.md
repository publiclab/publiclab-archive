###Collaborations###

P&C project for NEH - neighborhood history - angle is to argue for funding to support website development through the angle of building capacity for neighborhoods to do “self-ethnographies”. 
Linking site + investigatory methods + intergenerational learning between parents and sprout kids = better PLOTS website

###Recent & Upcoming events###

Sunol Ag Park(this last Sat) data online soon

###Fundraising###

NEH due tomorrow

https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ypyfJLgMTRwpt6GqJaM8IFueVqPNvr4lO6aBgYh7LI/edit?hl=en_US
Google Lat/Lng blog - for a few months from now, need to connect with Riverkeeper. 
Roles map going online today - Sara says Chric C supports moving all well-watch content (including Rick’s previous narrative accounts) to PLOTS. This means we can annotate the Garfield County map with these stories. 
Estrogen stuff: going good, have lab equipment and space, meeting with Avery at Sprout who has been doing glowing bacteria and he is excited about the yeast assay project. donated spectrometer (260nm lower than our filters, UV range spectrometer for genetics + expensive quartz tubette) and donated incubator through Dr. Rudiman. (this sounds like magic!)

NDVI stuff from Boulder coming online this week, prelude to barnraising,
