* Environmental Justice League in Providence--Proposal to run two summer workshops on balloon mapping of two contaminated local sites, use IR camera to study the urban heat Island, and inclusion of thermal flashlight into their winterization program: They have asked us what we want in terms of funding--I proposed that they cover kit costs.
