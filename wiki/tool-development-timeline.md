This is an attempt to chart the development of a Public Lab tool in general terms. Some people have also volunteered to explore and expand on these stages in longer articles; their names are listed below.

Many steps may occur earlier or later; we're just trying to better understand them and get better at the process. Feel free to add/revise:

##A. Sandbox##

###Problem Definition###

* Propose, state problem, invite collaboration
* Explore relevance to Public Lab mission
* Propose testable solutions
* Adam

##B. Early Adopter##

**Tools:** [Estrogen sensing](/tool/environmental-estrogen-testing), [Air column monitoring](/tool/air-column-monitor)

###Proof of Concept###

* Shared early documentation - beginning of open sourcing
* Home or Lab prototype demonstrating basic idea
* Page describing the tool and it's intent and context
* Consider cost issues
* Sara

**Tools:** [H2S sensor](/tool/hydrogen-sulfide-sensing), [Indoor air-quality mapping](/tool/indoor-air-quality-mapping)

###Develop a network of collaborators###

* Find a community of like interest, like Coral growers or DIY Bio
* Host exploratory hackathons
* Create a distributable prototype- one that can be shipped to people
* Liz

**Tools:** [Thermal Flashlight](/tool/thermal-photography)

###Produce documentation###

* Consider who can make one and how easily
* Legibility of documentation, completeness of parts list & codebase
* Liz

##C. Using Tools and Doing Science##

**Tools:** [Spectrometer](/tool/spectrometer)

###Refining and using tools regularly###

* The "build it and leave it" problem at workshops
* Building experience with a tool and its limitations
* Small retail circulation of kits to jumpstart community
* Shannon

**Tools:** [Near-infrared camera](/tool/near-infrared-camera)

###Lifecycle: develop a defined path from raw data to results###

* Begin to develop helpful software
* Developing a "Hello World" for people to aim for as their first attempt
* Compare and contrast results and improve & refine tool
* Calibrating and comparing to existing tools
* Jeff

##D. Scaling and outreach##

**Tools:** [Balloon & Kite Mapping](/tool/balloon-mapping)

###When to go big###

* Developing retail kits to get people started quickly
* Support data analysis and understanding with in-depth documentation
* How-to guides, YouTube videos
* Mathew

###Credibility and Outcomes###

* Build credibility for process and results
* Develop case studies
* Get quantitative
* Stewart
