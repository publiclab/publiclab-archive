# Public Lab archive

This is a static (read-only) archive of the PublicLab.org website, and is an ongoing project to preserve it as an accessible and free resource. Please see https://github.com/publiclab/publiclab-archive for more.

URLs follow the same format as the original site, but automatically redirect to a slightly modified URL; that is:

https://static.publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping

becomes (automatically, if it's on GitHub Pages):

https://static.publiclab.org/#wiki/balloon-mapping

Here are some good starting points:
