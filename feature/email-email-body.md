Welcome to Public Lab!

We're an open community dedicated to making environmental monitoring more accessible to all. In Public Lab, our public questions, ideas, and exploration help to build the resources available for everyone to use.

There’s a lot you can do in Public Lab: learn how to do environmental investigation in your community, help to build and develop research tools, and work with others to advocate for change.
